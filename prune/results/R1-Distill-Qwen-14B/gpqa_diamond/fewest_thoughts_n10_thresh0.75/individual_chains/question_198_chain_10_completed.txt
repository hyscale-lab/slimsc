Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when metal ions react with ligands, they form complexes, and the stability constants (beta values) tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

So, let's read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, beta values usually correspond to the formation of different complexes. For Co(II) thiocyanate complexes, I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+, where n is the number of SCN- ligands.

The first complex would be Co(SCN)(n=1), the second [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on. But wait, the beta values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Stability constants are typically for each step of complexation. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for the third complex would be β1*β2*β3, if the complexes are stepwise.

Wait, no, the stability constants are given as stepwise. So the first complex is Co(SCN), and β1 is its formation constant. The second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, has β2 as the addition of another SCN- to the first complex. So β2 is the formation constant for the second ligand, given that the first is already bound. Similarly, β3 is for the third SCN, and β4 for the fourth.

But wait, the problem here is that β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). That might complicate things because higher β values mean more stable complexes.

Wait, wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that the different Co(SCN)n^m+ complexes have different colors. For example, the [Co(SCN)]^+ is blue, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is green, [Co(SCN)3]^3- is brown, and [Co(SCN)4]^4- is violet. So the question is asking about the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, which has two SCN- ligands. Wait, no, wait: dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), and the green is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Wait, I might be mixing up the colors. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Oh, wait, I think [Co(SCN)]^+ is blue, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is green, [Co(SCN)3]^3- is brown, and [Co(SCN)4]^4- is violet. So if the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-, that's the green complex, not the blue. Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato" which I think means two SCN- groups. So the green complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Wait, but the question is about blue, which is [Co(SCN)]^+. So maybe I got that wrong. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify: the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" which seems contradictory. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misremembering. Maybe the blue is for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the colors. Let me think: I think the blue is the [Co(SCN)]^+ ion, which is the monothiocyanato complex. The dithiocyanato would be the di- one, which is green. So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is monothiocyanato. Hmm, but wait the question says "blue dithiocyanato". Oh wait, maybe that's a mistake. Or perhaps I'm getting the terminology wrong.

Wait, maybe the "blue" refers to the [Co(SCN)]^+ complex, which is a monothiocyanato complex. Then the term "dithiocyanato" would mean two SCN groups. So the question is asking about the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ in the solution.

Wait, but the question says "the blue dithiocyanato". I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should focus on the problem statement. The question is: What's the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. So I think the correct complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which is green, but the question says blue. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the colors mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is a different complex. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato doesn't necessarily imply the number of ligands? No, that can't be right; dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So these are the formation constants for each successive ligand binding. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] )

β3 = [Co(SCN)3]^3- / ( [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ [SCN^-] )

β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^4- / ( [Co(SCN)3]^3- [SCN^-] )

So, each β is the stepwise formation constant for adding each subsequent SCN-.

The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Wait, but wait. The blue might be a different complex. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)]^+ complex. Let me think again. I think I might have the colors mixed up. The [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is green, [Co(SCN)_4]^4- is violet. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the colors wrong. Alternatively, some sources say that [Co(SCN)]^+ is blue, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is green, [Co(SCN)3]^3- is brown. So in that case, the blue is the monothiocyanato complex. So the question is asking about the blue complex, which is the monothiocyanato, [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato", which implies two SCN groups. So maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ as the dithiocyanato complex, which is green, not blue. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed regardless of the color as I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, which would be the monothiocyanato complex, and is blue. But the term dithiocyanato is confusing me.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which is the dithiocyanato (two SCN groups) complex, regardless of the color. But the question specifies "blue" which may not correspond to [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculations, regardless of the color confusion, and see where it leads me.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of a specific complex (probably [Co(SCN)₂]^2+) in the solution.

To calculate the distribution of the complexes, I need to find the fraction of each possible complex. The possible complexes are:

1. Co²+ (uncomplexed)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanato)
3. [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (dithiocyanato)
4. [Co(SCN)3]^3- (trithiocyanato)
5. [Co(SCN)4]^4- (tetrathiocyanato)

But since the solution is neutral, perhaps the higher order complexes (like [Co(SCN)4]^4-) would require more SCN- than what's available. Also, considering charge balance, but perhaps the solution is in a state where the majority of Co exists in certain complexes.

Wait, but the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is higher than [Co²+] which is 0.01 M. So the ligand is in excess, so the formation of complexes is more likely.

The idea is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them all, and find the percentage for the desired complex.

The general approach is to use the stability constants (β) to calculate the fraction (or mole fraction) of each species.

So, the fractions are calculated using the formula:

fraction = (β^n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1*[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The general approach for a metal ion M and ligand L is that each species MnL^(n+) has a concentration [M^n+L^n], and the fraction is [M^n+L^n] divided by the total concentration of M.

But for the nth complex, the fraction is (β1 β2 ... βn) [L]^n / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βm [L]^m ), where m is the maximum possible number of ligands.

Wait, but in this case, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Thus, the fraction f_n of the nth complex would be (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (sum from k=0 to k_max of (β1 β2 ... βk) [L]^k )

Here, k_max is the highest possible complex, which I think is 4 in this case, because β4 is given.

But wait, in the problem, the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is higher than the [Co²+] concentration (0.01 M). So, the higher complexes may form, but perhaps the sum converges.

So, let's compute the numerator and denominator for each possible complex.

First, we need to compute:

For each k (0 to 4):

term_k = product of β1 to βk * [SCN]^k

But for k=0, term_0 = 1 (since it's the free Co²+ ion, which has no ligands).

So, let's compute each term:

Compute [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

term_0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1

term_1 = β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

term_2 = β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 *0.01 = 360 *0.01= 3.6

term_3 = β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = let's compute:

9 *40 = 360; 360 *63 = 22680; (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001 = 22.68

term_4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN]^4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute each step:

9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362,880; (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, the terms are:

term_0 = 1

term_1 = 0.9

term_2 =3.6

term_3=22.68

term_4=36.288

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, term_4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 multiplied by [SCN]^4.

So, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So 9 *40 = 360.

360 *63 = let me compute 360 *60 =21,600; 360*3=1,080 → total 22,680.

22,680 *16 = 362,880.

[SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So 362,880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So yes, term_4 is 36.288.

Now, sum all the terms: sum = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288.

Let me compute step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is 64.468.

Each term represents the numerator for each complex. So:

- The fraction of Co²+ (free ion) is term_0 / sum = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.01551.

- The fraction of [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanato) is term_1 / sum = 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.01396.

- The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (dithiocyanato) is term_2 /sum =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05554.

- For [Co(SCN)3]^3-: term_3 / sum =22.68 /64.468 ≈ 0.3519.

- For [Co(SCN)4]^4-: term_4 / sum =36.288 /64.468 ≈ 0.5626.

Wait, but let me check: 1 + 0.9 is 1.9 plus 3.6 is 5.5, plus 22.68 is 28.18, plus 36.288 is 64.468. Yes.

So the fractions are:

Co²+: ~0.0155 (1.55%)

[CoSCN]^+: ~0.01396 (1.40%)

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+: ~0.05554 (5.55%)

[Co(SCN)3]^3-: ~35.19% (approx 35%)

[Co(SCN)4]^4-: ~56.26% (approx 56%)

Wait, but wait, wait! I think I made a mistake here. Because the way stability constants work, each term is the product up to that β, multiplied by [SCN]^n. So, for [Co(SCN)]^+, the fraction is (β1 [SCN]) / sum.

But I'm getting the fractions for each complex. So, the question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

From the calculations, the fraction is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈0.05554, which is approximately 5.55%. But wait, looking at the options, none of them is close to 5.5%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given in a different way. Another possibility is that the β values are for the overall formation of the complex, not stepwise.

Wait, no, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think they are stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the overall formation constants instead of using the stepwise βs.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the stepwise and overall βs.

Wait, no, the stepwise approach is correct because each β is the formation constant for each additional ligand.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the question is about [Co(SCN)]^+ which is the monothiocyanato complex, which is the first term. But from the fractions, that's about 1.40%, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Let me think. If the overall β for [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1=9, for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is β2=40, which would be the overall β for the second complex. But that doesn't make sense because the overall β would be β1 * β2/(something else?), which can't be. Wait, no, the overall β for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would be the product of β1 and β2. So perhaps I should compute it that way.

Wait, perhaps I got the definition wrong. Let me clarify. Stepwise formation constants (β) are the constants for adding each ligand. So, the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would be K2 = β1 * β2.

Similarly, K3 = β1β2β3, and K4=β1β2β3β4.

In that case, the fractions would be calculated as:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}^+, the fraction is (K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, wait: no, because the K for [Co(SCN)]^+ is K1=β1, K for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is K2=β1β2, K3=β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

So, the fractions would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, [SCN] is the concentration of the ligand, which is 0.1 M.

Wait, but for K0, it's the uncomplexed Co²+, which is 1. So, sum is f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4 = 1.

Wait, no, wait: the sum is (K0 [SCN]^0) + (K1 [SCN]^1) + (K2 [SCN]^2) + (K3 [SCN]^3) + (K4 [SCN]^4) ) in the denominator.

Wait, but K0 is 1 for the uncomplexed ion, K1 is β1, K2 is β1β2, K3 is β1β2β3, K4 is β1β2β3β4.

So, the terms are:

K0: 1

K1: β1 =9

K2: β1β2=9*40=360

K3:9*40*63= 22680

K4:9*40*63*16= 362880

So, the terms are:

term_0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 =1

term_1 =9 *0.1=0.9

term_2=360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

term_3=22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

term_4=362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the fractions are:

f_0 = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.01551 (1.55%)

f_1 =0.9 /64.468≈0.01396 (1.40%)

f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05554 (5.55%)

f_3=22.68/64.468≈0.3519 (35.19%)

f_4=36.288/64.468≈0.5626 (56.26%)

So, the same as before. But according to this, the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]^2+) is about 5.55%, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, the options are all in the 16-42% range. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question or the β values.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)3]^3-, which is 35.19%, but that's close to option C, which is 38.1%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute the sum. 1 +0.9 is 1.9, plus 3.6 is 5.5, plus 22.68 is 28.18, plus 36.288 is 64.468. Correct.

So the [Co(SCN)3]^3- is 22.68 /64.468 ≈ 0.3519, which is 35.19%, but option C is 38.1%, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should include the charge into the stability constants. Wait, I don't think that affects the distribution; the stability constants are given as β values, which are based on the formation of the complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the fraction but the concentration. Wait, but the question says: percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, another possibility is that I'm considering the wrong complex as the dithiocyanato. Maybe the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)4]^4-? But that's unlikely. Or perhaps the dithiocyanato is the trithiocyanato? No, that would be [Co(SCN)3]^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the β values. Let me think: the β4 is 16, which is actually lower than β3 (63). So, the fourth complex has a lower stability constant than the third. Which suggests that the third complex is more stable, so more of it would form than the fourth. Wait, no, the overall formation constant K4 is β1β2β3β4, which is 9*40*63*16 = 362,880. So the fourth complex has a higher overall stability, so more of it would form. But in our calculations, the fraction of the fourth complex is about 56%, which is the highest.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex. So in the fractions, that's about 5.55%, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given in the reverse order. For example, maybe β1 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)4]^4-, which would complicate things. But that's not indicated in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the β values as the overall constants for each step, not stepwise. But no, the question states they are stability constants.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the fraction of each possible complex, considering the possibility that the sum of all fractions is 100% and then see which option matches.

Wait, another approach is to assume that the majority of the species are the most stable complexes.

Looking at the fractions, the fourth complex has 56%, the third 35%, the second 5.5%, the first 1.4%, and the free ion 1.55%. So the majority is the fourth complex, then the third, then the second.

But the options don't have 5.5%, so perhaps the question is about a different complex.

Wait, perhaps the question is about [Co(SCN)3]^3-, which has a fraction of ~35%, which is close to option C (38.1%). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Wait, let me recalculate the terms.

Compute each K_n [SCN]^n:

K0 [SCN]^0 =1 *1 =1

K1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

K2 [SCN]^2=9*40 * (0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

K3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

K4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9 =1.9 → 1.9+3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So, [Co(SCN)3]^3- has 22.68/64.468 ≈0.3519 or 35.19%, which is close to option C (38.1%). But it's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should include more decimal places.

Let me compute 22.68 /64.468 more accurately.

22.68 ÷64.468.

Let me compute 22.68 /64.468.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 11.34 /32.234.

Hmm, 32.234 ×0.353 is about 11.37. Wait, 32.234 ×0.353 → 32 ×0.353=11.3 (approx). So 0.353. So 35.3%.

Wait, but earlier I had 35.19%, but perhaps more accurately, 35.2%.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex. But that's 5.55%, which is not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the fractions. Another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of each species as:

f_n = (β1 β2 β3 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / ( [Co²+] + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Which is the same as what I did earlier. So perhaps the issue is that the β values are given in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all complexes containing two SCN groups, not just [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. But that's the same as the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the metal is present as Co³+ instead of Co²+. But the problem states it's Co(II), so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the stability constants in a way that I'm not considering. Maybe the β values are given as the overall constants K1, K2, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that β1 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc. So:

K1=β1=9,

K2=β2=40,

K3=β3=63,

K4=β4=16.

In this case, the fractions would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN]^k )

But that would change the calculation.

So, for this scenario:

term_0=1

term_1=9 *0.1=0.9

term_2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

term_3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

term_4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So fractions:

f_0=1/2.3646≈0.4225 (42.25%)

f_1=0.9/2.3646≈0.381 (38.1%)

f_2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 (16.9%)

f_3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 (2.66%)

f_4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 (0.0676%)

So, the fractions under this assumption are:

f_0≈42.25%, f_1≈38.1%, f_2≈16.9%, etc.

Looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which matches f_1. But wait, in this case, f_1 is the fraction of [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanato), which would be the first complex. So, if the question is asking about the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^+, then under this assumption, its fraction is 38.1%, which is option C.

But earlier, when using the stepwise βs, the fraction was about 1.4%. So which approach is correct?

The problem states that the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, etc. So the stepwise approach is correct. So, why is the option C 38.1% matching when we considered the βs as overall constants?

Ah, perhaps the confusion is between the overall and stepwise formation constants. If the βs are the overall constants, then the calculation as done earlier gives f_1=38.1%, which is option C. But in the problem, the βs are given as the stepwise formation constants, so the correct approach is the first one, which gives the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ as 5.55%.

But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, going back to the problem statement. It says, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16."

Stability constants are typically given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. Or wait, no, usually, stability constants (formation constants) are given as overall constants. So, for the first complex, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16. So each complex's formation constant is given, not stepwise.

Wait, that would make sense because K2 would then be the overall constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

In that case, the fractions would be as I calculated in the second approach, leading to option C being 38.1% for the first complex.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Wait, but under this assumption, the fraction for the second complex would be 16.9% (option D).

Wait, no, in the second approach, the fraction for the second complex (n=2) is 0.4 /2.3646= ~16.9% (option D), which is 16.9%. So, if the question is about dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, then f_2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in this approach, the f_1 is 38.1% which is option C. So which is correct?

The problem is that the given βs are ambiguous. If they are stepwise, then the first fraction is 1.4%, and the second is 5.5%, but no options match. If they are overall, then the second complex is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the problem statement says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So, which interpretation is correct?

Stability constants (formation constants) are typically given as the overall constants for each complex. For example, K1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, K2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc.

So in that case, the second approach is correct, and the fractions are as computed, leading to the second complex having 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the second complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, then under the assumption that the βs are overall, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But some sources (like textbooks) might present the stability constants as stepwise. So, this is a bit confusing. But given the options, the correct answer must be among A to D.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's assume that the βs are stepwise.

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

Then, the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would be (K2 [SCN]^2 )/( sum of all terms ), which is 3.6 /64.468≈5.55%.

But that's not an option, so perhaps this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the first and second complexes, and ignoring the higher ones. But that would be an oversimplification.

Another possibility is that the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato species, which includes any complexes with two SCN groups. But that's the same as the fraction I calculated.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all complexes, regardless of the number of SCN groups, but that's not the case. The question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Given that, and considering the options, the only matching option is D)16.9%, which would come from the second approach where the βs are treated as overall constants.

So, the correct answer would be option D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex, meaning:

- K₁ = β₁ = 9 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺)
- K₂ = β₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺)
- K₃ = β₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)₃]³⁻)
- K₄ = β₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁻)

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

where \( K_0 = 1 \) represents the uncomplexed Co²⁺ ion. The terms are computed as follows:

- \( K_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \)
- \( K_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( K_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( K_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

The sum of all terms is:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9%)}.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
