Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. There are hints provided, so I'll have to use them to figure out the structures.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹, and E's IR is around 1715 cm⁻¹.

The options are four possible structures for E.

Let me break this down.

First, analyzing Hint a: The reaction of A with a phosphorous ylide gives a specific cyclopentane structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So, A is probably a carbonyl compound—like a ketone or aldehyde.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. The cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group attached to a CH(CH3) group, like CH2-C(CH3)=.

Wait, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH3)2C=CH– probably. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH2CH3 where the ylidene is the double bond part? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the structure where the ylidene is at position 2. So, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent is at position 4 as a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. Then, at position 4, it's connected via a double bond to a propan-2-yl group. So, the substituent is an allyl group, perhaps.

But for the Wittig reaction, the ylide would attack a carbonyl group. So, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl (A) and the ylide. So, A must have a carbonyl group.

Looking at the product, the double bond is at position 4 of the cyclopentane. So, maybe
