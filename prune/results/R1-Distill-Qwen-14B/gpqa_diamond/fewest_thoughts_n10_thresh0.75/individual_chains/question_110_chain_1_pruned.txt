Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. From the information given, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can do stars brighter than 16 V mag. So the key here is to find the stars that are brighter than both of these thresholds. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the stars must be bright enough for both instruments. Because each has their own brightness limit.

Wait, no, wait. The question says which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So each star needs to be observable by both instruments. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES), right? Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it, but wait no—if a star is, say, magnitude 15, both can see it. Oh wait, but wait—if the star's apparent magnitude is lower than both thresholds, then both can see it. Let me think: for a star to be detected by HIRES, its apparent magnitude must be ≤16. For ESPRESSO, ≤17. So any star with apparent magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both. Because it's within both limits. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

HIRES can observe stars up to V mag 16. So if a star is, say, 15 mag, it's detectable by both. Because 15 is less than 16 (HIRES limit) and also less than 17 (ESPRESSO). But a star that's 17 mag wouldn't be detectable by HIRES because 17 is above 16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16 for both instruments to detect it.

Wait, but the problem is that some stars have absolute magnitudes given, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Because absolute magnitude is how bright they are at 10 pc, but their actual apparent brightness depends on their distance.

Let me look at the stars one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be M + 5 log10(d/10). Wait, yes, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Because when d is in parsecs, it's M +5*(log10(d) -1). So for d=10, log10(10)=1, so m =15.5 +5*(1-1) =15.5. So m=15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.
