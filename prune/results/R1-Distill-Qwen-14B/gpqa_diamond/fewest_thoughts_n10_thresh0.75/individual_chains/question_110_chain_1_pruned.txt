Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that spectrographs have certain limits on how bright the stars need to be for them to observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh right, if it's brighter than 17, that means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17th magnitude. HIRES can go brighter, up to 16th mag. So any star with apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be seen by HIRES, and any star ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: V magnitude is absolute, 15.5 mag. Wait, wait, wait. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. But the actual apparent magnitude depends on distance. Star1 is at 10 pc, so its apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, 15.5. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. That's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES requires <=16 mag. So 15.5 is okay for HIRES. So Star1 is observable by both.

Wait, wait, no. Wait the question says: Which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So both can detect them.

Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than V mag 17 can be observed. Oh wait, no: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Brighter than 17 would mean apparent magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star's apparent V mag is ≤17, ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

So the key is to compute each star
