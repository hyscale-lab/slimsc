Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, and so on.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? I think it's about their spatial distribution in the galaxy. Oh wait, wait, if they're uniformly distributed in space, that would mean that the number density of stars is constant in all directions, right? So the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate the number of stars in a shell between parallax plx and plx + dplx, divided by dplx, as a function of plx.

Let me think about the volume. For a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. So if I have a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dd. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, since d is 1/plx, let's express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, dd would be the change in distance. But wait, the parallax is plx, so when plx increases by a small amount dplx, how does that affect d? Let's see, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense since further stars have smaller parallax.

But for the volume calculation, I'm more interested in how the volume element in parallax space relates to dplx. So the volume of the shell in terms of parallax would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)). Wait, let me clarify: 

The volume element in distance space is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -d^2 dplx (since d =1/plx, dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx), so putting it together:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

Wait, that's 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx) ) → 4π (-1 / plx^4 ) dplx. But the volume can't be negative, so I guess the absolute value is taken, so it's 4π / plx^4 * dplx.

Wait, no, because d is increasing when plx decreases. So when plx increases by dplx positive, d decreases, so the shell is between plx and plx + dplx, which would be a lower d. But I think the volume would involve the change in d. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Another approach: Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per volume), a constant.

The volume of a thin shell between distances d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But again, the negative just shows direction; the absolute number is positive. So N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) ) * dplx → n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that gives N = (4π n / plx^4 ) * dplx. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, the question is the number of stars per unit range of plx. So N/(dplx) would be 4 π n / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, the options are A) ~1/plx^4, B) 1/plx^2, etc. So according to this, the answer would be A. But I'm confused because I thought the number of stars increases with closer distance. Let
