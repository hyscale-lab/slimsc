Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So the formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/distance.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. The options are all different inverse powers of plx. So I'm thinking about the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. But wait, stars are probably not that uniform, but the question says to assume they are uniformly distributed, so I'll go with that.

So imagine a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell would be surface area times thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr². The thickness would be a small change in radius, dr. So the volume element is 4πr² dr.

But since the distance r is related to parallax, let's express everything in terms of plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr would be the derivative of r with respect to plx. Let me compute that: dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). But since I'm considering a small range of plx (like from plx to plx + dplx), the change in r would be dr = (dplx) * (-1/(plx²)). But since dplx is positive (we're looking at a range), maybe I should take the absolute value. So dr = dplx / plx².

Wait, but the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²). Because r is 1/plx, so r squared is 1/plx². And dr is dplx/(plx²). So putting it together, the volume element dV is 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) )= 4π dplx / plx^4.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume element would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. Since the stars
