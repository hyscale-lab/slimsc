Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist found a white solid and gathered some spectral data to identify it. The task is to figure out which structure it corresponds to from the given options. The options are A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid, C) Phenyl chloroformate, and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Alright, let's break down the spectral data provided. I remember that in mass spectrometry, the molecular ion peak gives the molecular weight. Here, the molecular ion is at m/z 156 (100%). There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. I think the molecular ion is the parent peak, so the molecule's molecular weight is 156. But wait, the peak at 158 is a fragment maybe? Or could it be something else, like an isotope?

IR data: A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually mean O-H stretching. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. I think that's a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from a carboxylic acid or an ester, or maybe an aldehyde if the peak is around 1700, but sometimes higher like 1720 could be a ketone or acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because of hydrogen bonding, but sometimes it's a broad peak. Also, aldehydes have a peak around 2800-2700 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which is a sharp peak. But in the IR here, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which covers a lot. Could that include an aldehyde's stretch? Or maybe it's an O-H from a phenol or carboxylic acid.

Looking at the H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). The singlet at 11 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Carboxylic acid protons are typically broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. So 11 ppm is high for an aldehyde but fits a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the IR, the strong peak at 1720 could be the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but benzoic acid derivatives would have an aromatic ring and a COOH group. So the NMR would have the aromatic protons. The 8.02 and 7.72 ppm doublets with
