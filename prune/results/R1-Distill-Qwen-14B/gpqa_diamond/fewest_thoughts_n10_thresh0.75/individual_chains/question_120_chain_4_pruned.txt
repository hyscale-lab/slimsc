Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to think this through.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth during the year. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. That means a star that's twice as far away has half the parallax.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me rephrase: if I consider a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? And how does that number change as plx increases.

I think it has to do with the volume of space at different distances. Because stars are spread out uniformly, the number of stars should depend on the volume available at a certain distance. The volume in a spherical shell would be 4πr² dr, right? So the number density of stars would multiplied by that volume.

Wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So let's express the volume in terms of plx.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx would correspond to distances d and d+dd, where dd is the change in distance. But since plx and d are inversely related, I need to find how the volume changes with plx.

Let me compute the change in distance for a given change in plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, dd = -d / plx² * dplx. Wait, plx is in arcseconds, so when plx changes by dplx, how much does d change?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density of stars (assuming uniform distribution). But since parallax is 1/d, we can express this in terms of plx.

So number of stars N in a thin shell at
