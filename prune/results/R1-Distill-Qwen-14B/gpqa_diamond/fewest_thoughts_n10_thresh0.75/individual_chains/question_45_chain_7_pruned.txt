Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I'm supposed to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the quantum number. Wait, the problem states that E is defined as E = π² ħ² / (2mL²), so E_n would just be n² * E. That simplifies things because I can express each particle's energy in terms of E.

But wait, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, right! They have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions, no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin as well.

In a one-dimensional well, each particle's state is determined by n (the principal quantum number) and spin. For spin-1/2 particles, each n can have two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles.

Wait, but in a 1D box, is the spin part of the quantum state? I think it is, because the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric for fermions. So each energy level (each n) can hold a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and the other with spin down.

So, for four particles, I need to distribute them into the lowest available energy levels, making sure that each n has at most two particles.

Let's think about how they fill up.

Ground state: The lowest energy levels are filled first. Each n can have two particles.

So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two will go into the next available n, which is n=2. Each of those two can have opposite spins as well.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, but each n can hold two particles. So let me write out the possible states.

Each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So for n=1, two particles (spin up and down). For n=2, two particles
