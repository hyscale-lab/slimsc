Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Hmm, the question talks about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses are directly relevant to the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Maybe the mass affects other things like their lifetimes or luminosities, but for elemental abundances using EW (equivalent width) method, perhaps the key is the given abundance ratios.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Oh wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So from that, I can find the solar abundances of Fe and Mg relative to H.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. Wait, no, wait. The notation is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, sometimes it's defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundances compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). Which means if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

But in this case, for Star_1 and Star_2, we're given some [X/Y] values. Let me list all the given data.

First, for Star_1:
- [Si/Fe
