Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And the options are various expressions involving exponentials with Jβ.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or wait, sometimes it's written as exp(-E/(kT)), since beta is 1/(kT). So yeah, each state contributes a term of exp(-βE).

First, I need to figure out all the possible states the system can be in. Each spin has two possible values, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

The next step is to calculate the energy E for each of these 8 states, then compute exp(-βE) for each, and sum them all up to get Z.

Wait, but calculating each of the 8 might take time. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Because if S_i and S_j are the same, their product is +1, else -1.

So, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 could be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let me check.

Wait, let's take some examples.

Case 1: All spins are the same, say +1. Then S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.

Case 2: Two spins +1, one -1. For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1.

Wait, another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3
