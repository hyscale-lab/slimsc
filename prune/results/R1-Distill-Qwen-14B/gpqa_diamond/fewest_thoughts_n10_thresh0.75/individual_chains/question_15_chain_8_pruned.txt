Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, transit probability... right, the chance that a planet will pass in front of its star from our point of view. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. But wait, no, actually, the minimum masses are the same because they were detected via the RV method. But the RV method gives the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination. But for transit probability, I think the actual mass doesn't matter because it's the size that matters for blocking the starlight. Oh wait, but the question says they have same masses, but maybe I'm mixing up mass and radius. Wait, the host stars' masses and radii are given. Let me read again.

So the planets have same minimum masses, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period (three times shorter), so it's closer to its star. The host star of Planet_1 is more massive (twice as much) but they have the same radii. Interesting.

Transit probability formula: I think it's roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else, but more accurately, the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a (1-e) / (R_s)), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, let me think. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (well, the part that would cause a transit) to the area of the star. Oh wait, no. The probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's disk to the star's disk, but more precisely, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a (1 - e)))... wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the geometric probability for a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's roughly (R_p / a
