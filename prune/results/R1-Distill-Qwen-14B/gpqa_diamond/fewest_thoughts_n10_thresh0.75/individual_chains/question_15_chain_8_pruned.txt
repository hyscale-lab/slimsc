Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher chance of transiting. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a tighter orbit.

The planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The host stars are different: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same radius. Interesting. So same radius but different masses.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. I know that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula: R_planet / (R_star * a), where 'a' is the orbital distance. Wait, no, wait. I think the formula for the probability is (R_p / a) / R_s, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the transit probability can also be approximated as (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about it in terms of geometry.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this happening (i.e., the geometric probability) is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's roughly R_* / a. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, the probability is actually proportional to (R_p / a) / (R_* / a) )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The geometric probability P of a transit is given by P = R_* / (a), where a is the semi-major axis. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the
