Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are solutions to the equation Aφ = aφ, where A is the operator, φ is the eigenvector, and a is the eigenvalue.

Given that Ay is defined as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So, Ay is c times this S matrix. Let me write that out. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, substituting S in, Ay becomes:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So, determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that product. (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²), which means a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait. Hold on. Let me double-check the calculation of the determinant. The determinant is (Ay - a I) which is:

[ (-a) , (-i h)/(4π) )
( (i h)/(4π), (-a) ) ]

So determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ) ] - [ ( (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Ah, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So equation is a² = (h²)/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π). 

So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check option A: their imaginary parts are +2πh or -2πh, real parts h/(4π) or -h/(4π). That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. Because a is real, as h and π are real constants. So the eigenvalues are purely real. So if any option says eigenvalues have imaginary parts, that's wrong.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, that would sum to a complex number. But our a is purely real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would imply complex eigenvalues, but our a is real. So B is wrong too.

So options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts, which our eigenvalues don't have. So either C or D is the correct statement.

Now, looking at the options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Wait, I know that for angular momentum operators, the square (like L²) commutes with the components (like Lz). So if a state is an eigenstate of Lx, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Lz. But L² commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of Lx is also eigenstate of L². So in this case, Ay is like the y-component of the angular momentum, scaled by c. So the square A² would be (c S)^2. Let's compute that.

Wait, actually, A is c S, so A squared is c² S². What's S squared? Let me compute S^2.

Matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^2 is S multiplied by S.

First row first column: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

First row second column: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Second row first column: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

Second row second column: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i^2 = 1.

So S² is [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I. So S squared is identity matrix.

So A² = c² * S² = c² * I. So A² is a scalar multiple of identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A² with eigenvalue c².

So for any eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². So the statement in option C is correct about A². Now, what about Az? Well, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute. So Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenstates are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenstates of Ay) are not eigenstates of Az. Hence, option C is correct in that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the basis functions for the matrix operator... Hmm. The matrix S is 2x2, so it's acting in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions of Ay (which are eigenvectors of Ay) form a basis for this space. Since the matrix is 2x2, it's two-dimensional, and if the operator is diagonalizable (which it should be, since S has two distinct eigenvalues, I think), then the eigenvectors would form a basis. So option D's statement is correct in that sense.

Wait, so both C and D seem correct? Hmm, but looking back at the options, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let's re-examine the options.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. We said that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A², but not necessarily of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the matrix has dimension 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but let me think. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the space. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct, because the matrix acts on these vectors, and since it's diagonalizable, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one statement is correct, but looking at the options, only one is the correct answer.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each option again.

So, for option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, because A² is c² I, so any vector is an eigenstate of A², regardless of being an eigenstate of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², because A² is a multiple of identity.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, this is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking back at the options, that's not possible. So maybe I've made a mistake.

Wait the operator Ay is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues, so it's diagonalizable, meaning the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the operator. So D's statement is correct.

If both C and D are correct, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking again at the question: the options are statements to consider during the calculation. So perhaps one is correct, the others not.

So I need to evaluate each option.

Let me go through each option again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But as we found, the eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues are complex as well, which is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As we discussed, yes, because A² commutes with everything, so correct. But what about Az? Since A is the y-component, and Az is the z-component, they don't commute, so correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the operator is 2x2 and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements, but perhaps only one option is correct in the multiple-choice.

Wait, but looking back, the problem is exactly as presented. So I need to check the options again.

The problem says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct. So let's think again.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues, which we found to be ±h/(4π). Its eigenvectors would form a basis for the space. So D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So that's correct.

But what about the other options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about whether the eigenvectors are orthogonal or not. Or perhaps the operator is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

The operator Ay is c * S. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. But S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian. Hence, c*S is also Hermitian (since c is real). So Ay is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real (which we already found) and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So the eigenfunctions are orthogonal, but do they form a basis? Because the space is two-dimensional, two orthogonal vectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So then, looking at the options, both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as individual options, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps which option is true.

Wait, another approach: the matrix S (and thus Ay) has eigenvalues +1 and -1 when scaled or not?

Wait, no, because we have the eigenvalues a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but the matrix S itself has eigenvalues. Let me compute S's eigenvalues.

We have S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are found by det(S - λ I) = 0.

So determinant of [ -λ, -i; i, -λ ].

Determinant is (λ^2) - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i * i) ) = λ² - (-i²) = λ² - ( - (-1) ) = λ² - (1).

So λ² =1 → λ= ±1.

So S has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c S has eigenvalues c*(±1) → ±c = ±h/(4π).

So when we solve for eigenvalues of Ay, we get ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real or complex? Well, since S is Hermitian, the eigenfunctions are orthogonal and can be chosen as real.

Wait, not necessarily. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors may be complex, but for a real symmetric matrix, they are real. But S is Hermitian, which for 2x2 matrices, perhaps the eigenvectors can be taken as real.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvectors of S.

For S, find eigenvectors for λ=1.

(S - I) v = 0.

S - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

So equations:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So eigenvector can be written as v = [v1, v2] = [-i v2, v2]. Let v2 =1, then v = [-i, 1].

But this is a complex eigenvector. Alternatively, perhaps we can find real eigenvectors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps for λ=1, the matrix equation is:

- v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

But if v is a real vector, then v1 and v2 are real. So this would require v1 to be imaginary, which is not possible. So perhaps the eigenvectors are complex.

Wait, but maybe I can scale them to make the vectors real. Alternatively, perhaps S has orthogonal eigenvectors that are complex.

But in this case, since S is Hermitian, its eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are orthogonal. So the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are orthogonal.

So perhaps the eigenvectors are complex, but since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors can form a basis.

So back to option C, which says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is c² I, any vector is an eigenstate, so yes.

But what about option D: eigenfunctions are basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis.

So, if both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as single choices, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, if the eigenfunctions are the basis, then D is correct. So the question is whether during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So perhaps during the calculation, you would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct), but also that they can be eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct).

But the options are presented as individual options, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because it's a true statement.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are either C or D.

Wait, I think that both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the problem statement again, the matrix S is given and used to form Ay. So the operator is 2×2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Also, since A² is c² I, any vector is an eigenstate of A², so the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the statement in C is incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but the second part says 'but not of the Z-component, Az'. So that's correct as well. Because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, any set of two linearly independent eigenvectors forms a basis. So D is correct.

But maybe that's not the case. For example, if the operator had repeated eigenvalues or was not diagonalizable, then the eigenvectors wouldn't form a basis. But in this case, since we have distinct eigenvalues (±h/(4π)), the matrix is diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps only one of the options is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either C or D, but looking back, perhaps I should think about the structure of the problem.

Another angle: the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So in the options, which option refers to this?

Looking at the options, none of the options directly mention this. Options A and B talk about complex eigenvalues, which isn't the case. So the correct statements must be among C and D.

In the calculation, the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form a basis (so D is correct). Also, they are eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct).

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is either C or D, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should read the options again to see if any of them are incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az. Which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is also correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's a trick. Because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors, so they form a basis. That's D.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statements are C and D, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's more specific about the relationship between eigenfunctions of different operators.

Wait, but the problem is to choose which statement is correct. Since both C and D seem correct, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that is definitely correct.

In the calculation, you have to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. So D is correct. Additionally, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But the options only allow one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

But to make sure, perhaps I should check which statement is a correct conclusion.

In the calculation, you'll find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct). Also, you'll find that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az (C is correct). So perhaps both are correct.

But since the options are multiple-choice and only one is correct, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: perhaps the problem is about the selection of which statements are valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the operator's eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to re-express what each option says.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Which is correct because A² is c² I, any vector is an eigenstate. So they are also eigenstates of A². But they are not eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Thus, if both C and D are correct, but the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question's options are designed such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S itself is not diagonal. So its eigenvectors are orthogonal, but perhaps they are complex. So when considering the eigenvectors of Ay, which are the same as S's eigenvectors (scaled by c), they would form a basis, so D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but considering that the statements in C are more about the properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to other operators, perhaps C is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenvectors form a basis, which is a fundamental property that would be considered during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct option based on the knowledge that the eigenfunctions of components of angular momentum (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az), but are eigenfunctions of the square (A²). So option C is correct because A² is a commuting operator.

So, considering all this, I think option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue and \( \phi \) is the eigenvector.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is given as:
     \[
     S = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & -i \\
     i & 0
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), found by solving \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.

2. **Option A:**
   - This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

3. **Option B:**
   - This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

4. **Option C:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of the \( Z \)-component \( A_z \).
   - \( A^2 = (c \cdot S)^2 = c^2 \cdot S^2 \). Since \( S^2 = I \), \( A^2 = c^2 \cdot I \), meaning any vector is an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). Thus, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option C correct.

5. **Option D:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - Since \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix, its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the two-dimensional space. Thus, this statement is also correct.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation. Option C provides a more specific and insightful property about the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
