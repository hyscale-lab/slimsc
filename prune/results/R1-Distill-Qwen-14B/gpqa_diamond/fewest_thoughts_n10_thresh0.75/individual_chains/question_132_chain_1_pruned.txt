Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. 

The molecular formula given is C10H14. Wait, so each compound must have that formula. Let me think about possible structures. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. So each compound is a benzene ring with four substituents, right? Or wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups on the ring, so each substituent is ethyl. So the molecular formula for diethyl would be C8H10 (since benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be C4H10, so total C6+4= C10, H6 +10 = H16? Wait, wait, no. Wait, if benzene has six carbons, and each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds two carbons. Two ethyl groups add four carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +4 =10. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H, each ethyl has 5 H (since -CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H, but wait, no. Wait, each ethyl group is -CH2CH2? No, ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl has 2 carbons, and each has 5 hydrogens. So two ethyls would be 10 H. Plus benzene's 6 H: 16 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, so 1,4-diethylbenzene would have C8H10? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyls are C4H10. So the diethylbenzene is C6H6 + C4H10 = C10H16? But the formula given is C10H14. Oh wait, so maybe I got that wrong. Let me recheck. Benzene is C6H6. Adding two ethyl groups (each -CH2CH3) adds 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens (each ethyl has 5 H). So total carbons: 6 +4 =10. Hydrogens: 6 + (5*2) =16? So the formula would be C10H16. But the problem says C10H14. So maybe diethylbenzene isn't possible here. Hmm, but the options include it, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the diethyl groups are in a different position that causes some symmetry or maybe some other effect. Or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which has two CH2 groups? No, wait, the ethyl group is a single substituent, so it's -CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. So each ethyl is -CH2
