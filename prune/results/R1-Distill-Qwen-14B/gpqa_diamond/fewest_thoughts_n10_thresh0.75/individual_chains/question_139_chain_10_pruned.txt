Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about two compounds, A and B, that when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water produce different diketones. I need to select the correct starting materials from the given options.

Hmm, first, I should remember what kind of reactions involve hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Oh right, I think this is about the HNO2 (nitrous acid) conditions, which are often used in the production of carbonyl compounds, like ketones or aldehydes. Wait, I remember that when amines are treated with nitrous acid, they can undergo various reactions, like diazotization or maybe something else. But wait, wait, I think there's another reaction where secondary alcohols can be converted into ketones. Oh right! I think that's the Stephen reduction or maybe some kind of oxidation. Wait, no, oxidation of secondary alcohols would give ketones, but under what conditions?

Wait, no. Oh! Wait, I think the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water is used in the production of carbonyl compounds from alcohols, but specifically for primary alcohols? Or secondary? Let me think.

Oh, right! The reaction I'm thinking of is the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes. But wait, oxidation of primary alcohols gives aldehydes, but that's under different conditions, like with KMnO4 or CrO3. Oh wait, maybe this is about something else. Oh! Wait, wait, there's a reaction called the Stephen reduction where an alcohol is converted into a ketone or aldehyde using nitrous acid and HCl. Or maybe it's the Oppenauer oxidation? No, Oppenauer is for secondary alcohols to ketones, but that's with ketones and acid anhydride. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the formation of a geminal diol from a ketone, but that doesn't fit here. Alternatively, I think that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) in acidic conditions (HCl), it can undergo a reaction that forms a ketone. But wait, that doesn't make sense because secondary alcohols are already adjacent to a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the dehydration of
