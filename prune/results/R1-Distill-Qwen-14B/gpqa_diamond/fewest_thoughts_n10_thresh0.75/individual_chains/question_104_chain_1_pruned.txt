Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main difference is the observed Doppler shift: Planet 1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet 2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, so the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K, which is the maximum velocity it moves towards or away from us. K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters.

I think the formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * ( (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

But since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's (because the planet is Neptune-like, which is much smaller than the Sun), M_star >> M_planet, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular, so we can ignore that term.

So the simplified K would be proportional to (M_planet) * (1 / (M_star^(1/3) )) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(2/3) )) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, but M_planet is much smaller than M_star. Let's say M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_planet/M_star is very small, so (1 + M_planet/M_star ) ≈ 1. So then K becomes proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(1/3)) ) *
