Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, same factor for both radius and mass. But how does that tie into the rest of the problem?

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember from my notes that this relates to the temperature of the star. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same too, since T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So both stars have the same temperature.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us, I guess. Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, does this mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the intrinsic (rest frame) wavelengths are the same? Because if Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength would be shifted.

Wait, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So this is the observed λ_max. So, because of the Doppler effect, Star_2's λ_max would be different. But according to the problem, it's the same as Star_1's. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but wait—Wien's Law relates the peak wavelength to temperature in the rest frame of the star. If the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the observed λ_max depends on both the star's temperature and its radial velocity. So maybe to find the intrinsic temperature, I have to account for the Doppler shift.

Let me think. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift when moving at speed v is approximately:
