Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, with cis or trans configurations. The NMR data given is:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty, but let me think about the structures involved.

First, acetates have the structure R-O-CO-R', right? So in this case, the acetate ester would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me recall the possible structures:

For propenyl acetate, the R group is CH2CH2CH2, but wait, no, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but more accurately, propenyl could be CH2CH2CH3, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-O- or similar. Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the substituents. The NMR data has two groups of protons: one around 7 ppm, which is quite upfield for aromatic, but wait, acetates don't have aromatic rings, so maybe it's something else. Wait, 7 ppm is high for alkenes. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester.

In the ester group, the oxygen is connected to the R group. So if R is a propenyl group, like CH2CH2COOCH2CHCH3 (but wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong). Alternatively, maybe the R group is something like CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond.

Wait, the ester is O-CO-O, so the structure would be CH3CO-O-R. Let me think about the structures for each option.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. So butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. Cis would mean the substituents on either end of the double bond are on the same side. So the structure would be CH2CHCHCH3, but wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH3CH2CH=CH2? No, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-... Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structure of the ester.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. So the R group is attached to the oxygen. For example, if R is CH2CH2CH2CH2, that's butyl. But for propen
