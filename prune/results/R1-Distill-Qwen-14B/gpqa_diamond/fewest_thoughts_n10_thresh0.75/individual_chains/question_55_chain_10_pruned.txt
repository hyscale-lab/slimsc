Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again. The compound is an unknown organic, and I need to figure out whether it's Cis or Trans, and between propenyl or butenyl acetate. The options are A, B, C, D.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quadruplets?
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

Hmm, let me think about each peak.

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm, 3H. That's probably an acetyl group (OAc), since the singlet suggests no neighboring hydrogens. So the structure likely has an acetate group, like CH3CO-O-R.

The other peaks are more about the R group. The other substituents are probably from an alkene, since we have a doublet and a doublet of quadruplets.

Looking at the downfield shift, 7.0 ppm is a high value. That's typical for an aromatic proton, but wait, wait. Wait, the molecule is an acetate ester, so maybe it's a vinyl group or some conjugated system. Oh, wait, but perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a proton that's deshielded due to conjugation, like in an enol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton next to an oxygen, like in an ester.

Wait, another thought: in allylic systems or conjugated dienes, protons can shift upfield or downfield. But 7.0 is quite downfield; perhaps it's an aromatic ring. No, wait, acetates don't have aromatic rings unless it's something else. Wait, no, the starting material is an organic compound, but the options are all about propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, with either cis or trans configuration.

Let me think about the structure. Acetate esters have the structure AcO-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. In this case, R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2 but that's not right. Wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl is probably CH2CH=CH2, but depending on where the double bond is. So for propenyl acetate, if the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, then the structure would be AcO-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: in the NMR, the splitting can tell us about the structure. The 7
