Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. But when they looked at their brightness, they peaked at the same wavelength. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply to both.

Wait, but the problem says they have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I think Wien's law comes into play here. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait a minute, but I thought that if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity would depend on the radius squared. Let me think: L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T is same, L is proportional to R². Since Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A, ~2.25. But wait, the options also have other numbers like 2.32, etc.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play? Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says that they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest
