Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how far a planet is from its star. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T = T_eff * (L / (16πσa²))^0.25, but maybe a simpler version when the star's luminosity is considered. Alternatively, I think the effective temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the formula for the equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^0.5. Oh wait, because the star emits energy, and the planet is at distance a. The flux is proportional to (L)/(4πa²), and the planet radiates as a blackbody, so setting the absorbed equal to emitted gives T^4 proportional to L/(16πσa²) or something like that. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³. So if I have a ratio of orbital periods, I can find the ratio of a's.

So the question says the planets are in orbital resonance, with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet
