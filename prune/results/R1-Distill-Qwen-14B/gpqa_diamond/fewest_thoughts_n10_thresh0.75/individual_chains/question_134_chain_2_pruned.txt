Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

First, the question says: 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy change. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to make sure my units are correct.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but since these concentrations and volumes vary, I can't just use the standard value. I have to calculate the actual moles involved.

So, the first step is to find out how many moles of H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution. Because when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Let me list each solution and calculate moles:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+.
   Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: It's a strong acid too, and it dissociates into 2 H+ and 1 SO4^2- per molecule.
   Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M.
   Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So each mole gives 2 H+, so total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.
   Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M.
   Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when we mix acids and a base, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is OH- because we have only 0.2 moles of OH-. So the amount of H+ that can react is 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. HCl contributes 0.1 H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+ → total 0.28 H+. The Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-.

In the neutralization, each H+ reacts with one OH-. So the maximum moles that can react is the lesser of H+ and OH-.

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting factor. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain unreacted.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is usually calculated based on the moles of H+ reacting. So the formula for enthalpy change (ΔH) is:

ΔH = n * ΔH_per_mole

What's ΔH_per_mole? For strong acid and base, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH- since it's 1:1). But wait, sometimes it's expressed per mole of H2O formed. Since each mole of H2O comes from one mole of H+ and one of OH-, so yes, each mole of H2O gives about -57 kJ.

So in this case, n is 0.2 moles of H2O produced. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have some in kcal and others in kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, my calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D (-16 kJ?), but wait, my calculation is about -11.4. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. So that's a possibility, but my answer is in kJ, not kcal. So there's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the enthalpy is per mole of reaction as written. Oh, because sometimes people report it
