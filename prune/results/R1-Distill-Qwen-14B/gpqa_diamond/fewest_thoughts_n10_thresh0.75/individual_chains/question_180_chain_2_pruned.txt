Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, alright. I remember that when dealing with charged particles, the energy involved is usually electrostatic potential energy. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at the potential energy stored in the configuration of these charges.

Wait, so all the particles have charge 2e. That's twice the elementary charge. So each is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, right? So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Now, 12 of them are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So maybe the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged symmetrically around it? Or maybe it's a different configuration.

Wait, but the problem says to find the minimum energy. So how do we arrange the charges to minimize the potential energy?

I recall that for a system of point charges, the electric potential energy is the work required to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the other charges already in place.

But wait, when you have multiple charges
