Okay, so I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So, the catalyst will help the molecule undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible or maybe some cross metathesis, but since it's an alkene, probably ring-closing.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH3)₂? Wait, no. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH3)CH3? No, because 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Let's see: 1 2 3 4 5. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Then 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the middle one. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait that doesn't seem right because the chain length might be off.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure correctly. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, is that possible? Oh wait, that would make the substituents on carbon 3: a CH2CH3 group? No, wait, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, maybe I
