Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. They want to know how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually means the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs catalyst, which is a transition metal carbene, facilitates this process. It can cause the alkene to break apart and recombine in different ways.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait, wait. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule has a double bond, the configuration around it can affect the product. Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene... Let me draw its structure.

Structure: The molecule is 3-methyl, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl group on C3. So that would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, let me count: pent is five carbons. So 1 2 3 4 5. So double bond between 1 and 2. Then, position 3 has a methyl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl on C3 would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The 3rd carbon is the one
