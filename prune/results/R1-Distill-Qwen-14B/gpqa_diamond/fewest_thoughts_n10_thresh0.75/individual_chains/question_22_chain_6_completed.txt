Okay, so I've got this question about electrochemistry, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to gain electrons, right?

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. And I have to pick the right combination from the options A to D.

Wait, I think thermodynamic aspects have to do with the favorability of a reaction, like the cell potential. A stronger oxidant would have a higher tendency to be reduced, so it would have a higher reduction potential. So if oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solution, that means in basic conditions, its oxidizing power is greater. What about acidic solutions?

Oxygen's reaction as an oxidant—like in the oxygen reduction reaction. I remember that in basic solutions, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH^- with a standard E° of around 0.401 V. In acidic solution, it's O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, with E° about 1.23 V. Oh wait, right, so the standard electrode potential is higher in acidic solution. That makes sense because in acidic conditions, the O2 reaction is more favorable—so thermodynamically, it's a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions than in basic. Wait, but the question says in the first blank, "in basic solutions"—what's its strength there?

Wait, the question is about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions. Since the E° is 0.401 V in basic, and 1.23 V in acidic. So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant compared to acidic. Because higher E° means stronger oxidant. So in basic, since E° is lower, the oxidant is weaker. So the first blank should be "weaker"—so the first part is weaker oxidant in basic.

Wait, wait, the first statement is about thermodynamic strength in basic. So comparing to acidic, it's weaker there. So the first blank is weaker.

Then the second part is about kinetic reactivity in acidic solution. Kinetics has to do with how fast the reaction proceeds, which is about the activation energy and the rate. I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction of oxygen (like the reduction) can be slower because of the possibility of forming O-O bonds. Oh wait, oxygen's reaction in acidic conditions is a more complex reaction, perhaps with a higher activation energy. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, in basic conditions, the O2 reduction produces OH- ions, which are maybe less likely to form O-O bonds. Whereas in acidic conditions, maybe the H+ could help stabilize some intermediates? Or perhaps in acidic conditions, the reaction is faster because the protons help in the electron transfer steps.

Alternatively, I recall that the oxygen reduction in acidic solution, O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, has a higher rate because the intermediates are more stabilized. Or is it the opposite? Let me think. Oh, wait, in acidic solutions, the reaction might have a lower rate because the presence of H+ can lead to some issues, like the possibility of forming H2O which might not be as reactive. Or maybe because the activation energy is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is faster in acidic conditions because the ions are more mobile? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach. The thermodynamic part: oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solution compared to acidic, so the first part is 'weaker'. Now, the second part is about kinetic reactivity in acidic solutions. So, in acidic, the reaction is either faster or slower.

I think that in acidic conditions, the reaction is more kinetically favorable, meaning it proceeds faster. Because in basic conditions, the reaction might be slower due to the presence of OH- ions, which can lead to the formation of less stable intermediates. Alternatively, I remember that in acidic solutions, the O2 reduction has a larger current density, implying a faster reaction.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about catalysis. For the oxygen reduction reaction, in acidic solutions, like in fuel cells, the catalysts (like Pt) facilitate the reaction more effectively, allowing it to proceed faster. So, in acidic, the reaction is faster kinetically.

Putting it together: thermodynamically, in basic, it's a weaker oxidant (weaker), and in acidic conditions, it reacts faster (faster). So looking at the options, the combination would be weaker and faster. Wait, but let me look at the options.

Options:
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

So, the first part is weaker, second is faster. So option C is weaker and faster. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the first part is about thermodynamic strength in basic—so compared to acidic, it's weaker. So the first blank is 'weaker'. The second part is about kinetic reactivity in acidic—so it's 'faster' because the reaction occurs more quickly. So yes, option C is correct.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis in Basic Solutions**:  
   The standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic solutions is approximately 0.401 V, while in acidic solutions, it is approximately 1.23 V. Since a higher reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidant, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. Thus, the first blank should be "weaker."

2. **Kinetic Analysis in Acidic Solutions**:  
   Kinetics refers to the speed of the reaction. In acidic solutions, the oxygen reduction reaction (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O) is more kinetically favorable due to the higher mobility of ions and the stabilization of intermediates. This makes the reaction faster in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Therefore, the second blank should be "faster."

3. **Combining the Results**:  
   From the above analysis, the correct combination is "weaker" for the thermodynamic strength in basic solutions and "faster" for the kinetic reactivity in acidic solutions. This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
