Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and the immune response in mice. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the experiment: They tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging. They saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer's patches and looked at the variable heavy chain gene, which showed high variability. The question is, which process is happening?

Hmm. So, what do I know about rotavirus and the immune system?

Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, mainly in children. It has several layers, and the inner capsid proteins are part of its structure. When they tag these with GFP, they can track them in the body.

The mice were given the tagged proteins via oral gavage. The stomach has a lot of acid, so some of the GFP would be destroyed there. The rest might make it through to the intestines, but the mucus in the intestinal tract can trap things. So the proteins that successfully reach the secondary lymphoid organs, like Peyer's patches, would be the ones that the immune system responds to.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. When the proteins reach there, they're probably taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells or M cells. These cells present the antigen to B cells, which then get activated.

Now, sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells shows high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process is causing diversification of the B cell receptors. What processes do that?

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process that occurs in B cells after they are activated. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, leading to more diverse antibodies. This happens during the germinal center reactions, which is part of the adaptive immune response.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, and it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't add variability to the variable regions. The variable regions are already determined during VDJ recombination.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process in the bone marrow where B cells generate their initial diversity by recombining V, D, and J segments. But this happens during B cell development, not after antigen exposure. So if this process were happening, the variability would be determined before exposure.

But wait, the question says that after isolating the cells from the Peyer's patches, they found high variability. That implies that the process is happening after the cells have been exposed to the antigen. Because VDJ recombination is during development, so all the B cells from a single progenitor would have the same variable regions, but after activation, they undergo somatic hypermutation which introduces more variability.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation. The B cells are activated, then undergo this process to increase the diversity of their receptors, which helps in a more specific immune response.

Wait, let me think again. When the GFP-tagged proteins are taken up by Peyer's patches, the B cells in the patches (like in the LP, lamina propria) or in the patches themselves would start to respond. They get activated, then migrate to the lymph nodes or other secondary lymphoid organs. But the high variability in the V regions suggests that they have undergone hypermutation, leading to more diverse antibodies.

So the correct process is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some is entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed by sequencing their variable heavy chain genes, which shows high variability.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and serve as sites for initiating immune responses to enteric pathogens. When the tagged rotavirus proteins reach the Peyer's patches, they are likely taken up by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells or M cells, which activate B cells. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies the B cell receptors after antigen exposure.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the germinal center reaction. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, leading to increased diversity in B cell receptors. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of B cell receptors.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not add variability to the variable regions, which are already determined.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity by recombining V, D, and J segments. However, this process happens before antigen exposure and does not explain the observed variability after the immune response is initiated.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the experiment is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which occurs after antigen activation and leads to diversification of B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
