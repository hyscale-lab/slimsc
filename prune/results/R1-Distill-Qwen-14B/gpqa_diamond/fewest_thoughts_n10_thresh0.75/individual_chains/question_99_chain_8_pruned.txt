Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, and I need to pick the right one based on the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But since the option structures have a COOH group, which is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. I think that's a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound has both a carboxylic acid group and a carbonyl, but wait, wait—carboxylic acids have a C=O, right? So that's consistent.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are the ones in double bonds, like in CH2=CH. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds? Or maybe it's not showing up as vinyl H's. Hmm. Or perhaps the molecule doesn't have any vinyl groups at all. So, that might rule out any structures with double bonds, but looking at the options, none of them have double bonds—so that part is okay.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated. I'm a bit rusty on splitting patterns, but let me think. Splitting happens due to neighboring H's. Each neighboring set of H's splits the signal into a multiplet. The number of neighboring H's determines the splitting.

So, a doublet of triplets would mean that a proton is next to two sets: one with two H's (a doublet from a neighboring CH2, maybe?) and another with three H's (a triplet from a CH3). Wait, no, the splitting is a bit more involved. Let me think again. Each neighboring group's H's will split the signal into a multiplet. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups, each with a different number of H's, the splitting can become more complex.

Let me consider each option's structure and predict their NMR splitting. The structures are:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, each option is a substituted cyclopropane maybe? Or perhaps a structure where two CH2 groups are attached to a central carbon? Or maybe it's a molecule like 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentanoic acid or something similar. Let me try to imagine each structure.

Wait, perhaps each of these structures is a substituted cyclohexane or another ring? Or maybe it's a di-substituted carbon. Let me think about each option's structure.

Looking at option D: Structure D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the central part is a carbon chain where the middle carbon (maybe C3) has two CH3 groups attached. Let me draw this out.

Wait, the formula seems to be: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the structure is something like:

CH2CH2(C)(CH3)(C)(CH3)COOH. Hmm, perhaps the two central carbons are each attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group? No, looking closer, the substituents are CH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is structured as: 

CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So, the two central carbons (maybe C2 and C3 in a four-carbon chain) have each a CH3 group and an H. So, each of these central carbons has two substituents: a CH3 and another CH group.

Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching point. Let me think about the NMR signals. The problem mentions two specific splitting patterns.

First, a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, the splitting arises from three neighboring groups. Each neighboring group's H's would contribute to the splitting. For example, if a proton is next to three different groups with 1, 2, and 3 H's respectively, the splitting would be more complex. But wait, the splitting is more about the number of neighboring H's, not the number of groups.

Wait, perhaps each neighboring group has a certain number of H's. For example, if a proton (A) is next to a CH2 group (B) and another CH group (C), then the splitting would be a doublet of triplets (because CH2 has two H's and CH has one H). So, for each neighboring group, the number of H's determines the splitting. So, if a proton is next to a CH2 and another CH, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets (but sometimes the order doesn't matter, so it's a doublet of triplets).

Alternatively, let me consider the splitting patterns:

Each line in an NMR signal is split by neighboring equivalent protons. So, each neighboring set of H's adds another splitting. For example:

- If a proton has two neighboring groups, one with n H's and another with m H's, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets (if n=1 and m=1), a triplet of doublets (if n=2 and m=1), etc.

In this problem, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, that means the proton is adjacent to three different groups, each contributing to the splitting. Wait, but in reality, each proton is split by each neighboring set of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (2 H), and another CH2 group (another 2 H), and maybe another CH group (1 H). Hmm, but wait, that would require three different adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is caused by coupling with two different protons, each with their own splitting. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups, each with two H's, but those H's are in different environments, it could result in a more complex splitting.

Let me look at each option and try to figure out where the complex splitting would occur.

Starting with Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, the structure is likely CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So, the central part has two carbons each attached to a CH3 and a H. So, each of these central carbons only has one H. Let's number the carbons:

1: CH3CH2-

2: C(H)(CH3)

3: C(H)(CH3)

4: COOH

Wait, perhaps it's
