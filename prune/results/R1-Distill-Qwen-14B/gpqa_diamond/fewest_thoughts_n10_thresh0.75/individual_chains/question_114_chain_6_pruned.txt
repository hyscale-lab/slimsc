Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question involves two reactions, and we have to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. 

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to figure out what A and B are. The options give possible pairs for A and B, so I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The reaction is with NaCN and reagent A to form a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, what's that product structure? 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group (CN) is at the end, and the hydroxyl (OH) and methyl groups are on the second carbon. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's CH2(CN)(OH)CH(CH3)2? Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism.

Wait, butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3, right? The reaction with NaCN and A gives a nitrile with a hydroxyl. I remember that in the presence of a nucleophile, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile, it typically adds to the carbonyl carbon, making a cyanohydrin. Yes, the product would be a cyanohydrin. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, but wait butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, wait, but butan-
