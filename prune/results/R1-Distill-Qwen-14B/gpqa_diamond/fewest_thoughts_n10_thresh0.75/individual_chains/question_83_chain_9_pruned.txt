Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the titration should form the acetate ion. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so let me think through this.

The problem says that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I should calculate the concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the final volume is 40 cm³ (20 + 20). The concentration formula is C1V1 = C2V2. So C2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity * Volume (in liters). The diluted solution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of CH3COOH are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Since it's a 1:1 reaction, moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, that's the equivalence point.

But wait, the problem asks about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, for the 25% point, we have added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since acetic acid is 0.001 moles, the NaOH reacts with some of it. So the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be
