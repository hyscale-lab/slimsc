Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? So after dilution, the concentration of the acetic acid must change. Oh, right, because when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. 

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M times 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right. Then when we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so the new concentration is moles over new volume. So 0.001 moles divided by 0.04 L is 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the problem says we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. They want to know the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's tackle the equivalence point. For a weak acid titration with a strong base like NaOH, the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, so the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because after dilution, the volume was 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration 0.025 M. So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001, yeah. 

NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is moles NaOH / Molarity NaOH. Moles of NaOH needed is 0.0
