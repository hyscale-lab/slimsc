Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration scenario.

Alright, let's break down what the problem says. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20+20 is 40. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, wait. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to find both pH values.

Okay, let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the initial dilution. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the new concentration would be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Because when you dilute a solution, M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = M1*(V1/V2). Here, V1=20, V2=40. So M2 is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, but when we're at 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid initially
