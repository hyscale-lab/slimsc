Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about titration. Hmm, let's see. The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, let me break it down. First, the initial solution: they have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then they dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution would change. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. Let me figure out the moles first. Moles of acetic acid initially is Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) is 0.001 mol. 

To reach equivalence, NaOH needs to neutralize all the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

The question asks about 25% titration and equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

First, let's handle the 25% titration point. At this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So let's think about how much acid and conjugate base we have. 

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. 25% of that (0.00025 mol) reacts with NaOH. So remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 mol. The NaOH adds 0.00025 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO^-). 

So now, the solution has both acetic acid and its conjugate base. This is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa = -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5, so log(1.85e-5) is approximately 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is between 1 and 10, so about 4.73). So pKa is about 4.73.

Now, the concentrations of A^- (acetate) and HA (acetic acid) in the solution. The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Initial volume was 40 cm³; adding 2.5 cm³ makes 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

Moles of HA: 0.00075 mol. Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L. Let me calculate that: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. The log of 0.333 is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = about 4.253. Hmm,
