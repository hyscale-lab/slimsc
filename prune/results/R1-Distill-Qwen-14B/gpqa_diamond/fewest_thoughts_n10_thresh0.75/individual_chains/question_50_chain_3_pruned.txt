Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a new quantum field theory and is looking at higher-order loop diagrams. There's this note with a string of constants and symbols: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the task is to find out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on this expression.

Right, Feynman diagrams with loops are related to perturbation theory orders. Each loop usually adds a factor of the coupling constant and contributes to higher-order terms. The number of loops is connected to the order in the perturbation series.

Let me break down the given expression. So the factors are alpha cubed, g squared, sqrt(2), 8, and 1 over (4 pi)^6, multiplied by (Q/M)^2.

Wait, alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4 pi epsilon_0) or something like that. And g is probably a coupling constant from some other interaction, maybe the strong force or something else. The (Q/M) term is a ratio of some charge or energy scale.

But how does this relate to the number of loops? I remember that in loop integrals, each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4 pi)^{d/2} where d is the spacetime dimension. Oh wait, in four dimensions, each loop contributes a 1/(4 pi)^2 factor because d=4, so (4 pi)^{4/2} = (4 pi)^2. So each loop would bring in a 1/(4 pi)^2 term.

Looking at the expression, I see 1/(4 pi)^6. So if each loop contributes (1/(4 pi)^2), then how many loops would give us (1/(4 pi))^6? Let's see: n loops would give (1/(4 pi)^2)^n = 1/(4 pi)^{2n}. So setting 2n=6, n=3 loops. Hmm, so that would suggest 3 loops.

Wait, but wait. Are there other factors that contribute to the (4 pi) terms? Like, maybe from the measure of the integral or other factors in the loop calculation. Or perhaps from the ren
