Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key difference between them is the NOESY spectra. The major has a cross-peak, minor doesn't. We need to find which two resonances in the major product are connected by this cross-peak.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the starting material: dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid usually forms an anhydride. Since the starting alkene is cis, the dehydration would form a bicyclic structure, probably a bicyclic anhydride. Wait, but the question says the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in 13C NMR at 137 and 165 ppm.

Hmm. In 1H NMR, a singlet at 7 ppm suggests something deshielded, maybe aromatic protons. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates to form an anhydride, perhaps the structure becomes something like a bicyclic system. Wait, maybe the anhydride is cyclic, like a bicyclic structure with conjugated double bonds, leading to aromatic protons.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks. One at 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond (maybe a carbonyl or an spÂ² carbon). The 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon, like an anhydride carbonyl. So the structure probably has two carbonyl groups in the anhydride.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe all the protons in the aromatic region are equivalent, which would imply
