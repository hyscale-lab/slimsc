Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us.

Wait, but how do I calculate the probability? I think the probability is related to the size of the planet and the star's size, but also the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s) or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) squared times (some function of the orbital distance and inclination). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but more accurately, it's a function of the inclination. The probability P is (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (1 - (b^2)^0.5), where b is the impact parameter. But wait, the impact parameter depends on the inclination. If the orbit is edge-on, the impact parameter is zero, which means the planet transits directly in front of the star. For other inclinations, it doesn't transit.

Wait, actually, the transit probability for a given planet is the chance that the inclination is such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. I think the formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied
