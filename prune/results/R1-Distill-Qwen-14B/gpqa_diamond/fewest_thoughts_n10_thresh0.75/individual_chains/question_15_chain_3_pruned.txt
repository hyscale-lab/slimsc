Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The question gives me several pieces of information, so I should break them down one by one.

First, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which might simplify things a bit.

The host stars are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but they both have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, same radius but different masses? Oh, because stars can have different masses and radii, but in this case, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Maybe slightly larger but here they have the same radius. Or maybe it's a main-sequence star and a subgiant? Not sure, but the key point is that the host stars have the same radius.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the star's size, but wait, actually, more precisely, the probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula I'm thinking about is the transit probability, which is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something else?), maybe the orbital distance plays a role in the alignment for transit.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh wait, maybe it's more about the planet's distance compared to the star's radius, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the chance that the planet's orbit, from our line of sight, allows it to pass in front of the star. It's given by the formula (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(1 - e^2)) )^(1/2), but since both are circular orbits (e=0), that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p) )? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by the formula (R_p + R_s) / (a_p), but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. I think the probability is more accurately given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ), or maybe
