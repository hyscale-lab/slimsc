Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. When measuring the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. So from what I remember, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait, that's a complex function. So the wave function is complex, which is okay because that's allowed in quantum mechanics.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the presence of 'i' suggests it's an imaginary component. So ψ(x) is a complex function. Let me write it as ψ(x) = A - iB, where A and B are real functions. In this case, A = a/sqrt(1+x) and B = 0.5.

Wait, but the wave function is a complex function, and the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (A² + B²). Because when you compute the square of the absolute value, (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + B². So that's correct.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

But wait, ψ(x) must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

Wait, but the problem states that when measurements were made, particles were found only between x=1 and x=3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside this region. Or perhaps, more accurately, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, because the integral of |ψ|² outside this region is zero. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and only non-zero in between.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but that's only valid in the region where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside of that, the wave function is zero.

So, to find 'a', we need to normalize ψ(x) between x=1 and x=3. Because the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be equal to 1.

So let's write that out.

The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the square of the absolute value is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is 0.5. So the square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Wait, wait a second. But wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i within x=1 to 3, and zero outside. So the integral from -infinity to infinity of |ψ|² dx is the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx. This must equal 1.

So to compute this integral, let's split it into two parts.

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) ] dx + integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)].

Which is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3.

That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding the two parts:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a² ≈ 0.7202, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.8485. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the wave function is in the region x=1 to x=3. So the integral is correctly set up as from 1 to3, and the function is zero elsewhere. So that's correct.

Another check: the function ψ(x) is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when x=1, the denominator is sqrt(2), and when x=3, it's sqrt(4)=2.

But for normalization, the integral is correctly calculated.

Wait, but wait, the wave function must be such that the integral is 1. So the calculation seems correct.

So 'a' is about 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is the answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+3) - \ln(1+1)\right] = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals and setting the sum equal to 1:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to \( 0.8485 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
