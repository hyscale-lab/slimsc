Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that seems a bit off because usually quantum states are vectors with complex numbers, but maybe in this case, it's a real vector. Oh right, the state is probably a vector in a three-dimensional space, like [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So let me write that down:

P = [
  [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but calculating eigenvalues for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious. Let me think if there's another way. Oh, wait a second, maybe the matrix P has some symmetry or pattern that can be exploited. Let me look for that.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices are diagonalizable and have real eigenvalues. The main diagonal is all zeros. The off-diagonal elements are either 0 or 1/sqrt(2). Hmm.

I wonder if P can be written in terms of some other basis. Alternatively, perhaps I can find its eigenvalues by considering the structure.

Alternatively, the problem might not require finding all eigenvalues but just figuring out the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue 0, because the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state vector.

Wait, but first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues.

Wait, but another approach: the observable P is an operator, and the expected value of P in the given state is ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩. But wait, wait. No, the question is about the probability of getting a particular value when measuring P. So the steps would be:

1. Find the eigenvalues of P. The possible outcomes are these eigenvalues.

2. For each eigenvalue λ, find the eigenvectors.

3. For each eigenvector |v⟩, compute the amplitude c = ⟨ψ | v⟩.

4. The probability is |c|^2.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P. But maybe that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors. Let's try to see if 0 is an eigenvalue.

Wait, if P has eigen
