Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a hypothetical situation. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The primary one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. I think the pp-III branch is one of them, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, right, the pp chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which maybe involve different isotopes or steps.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we're looking at the situation where the change in the Sun's core would affect the neutrino flux we detect now. Because neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the change in their production would be detected almost immediately after the event.

So, the flux of neutrinos we receive is a result of the processes in the Sun's core. The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

I need to figure out how the flux from each of these bands would change if the pp-III branch stops. Let me think about each neutrino type and their sources.

The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the proton-proton chain and in the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos through two main processes: the dominant pp-I branch and the less dominant pp-II and pp-III branches.

The pp-I branch produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus captures an electron (beta decay) to become helium-8. This is a major source of high-energy neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant but still contribute, especially at lower energies perhaps.

Wait, neutrino energies are related to the masses of the particles involved. The pp-I branch produces higher-energy neutrinos because it's a later step in the chain, involving heavier isotopes
