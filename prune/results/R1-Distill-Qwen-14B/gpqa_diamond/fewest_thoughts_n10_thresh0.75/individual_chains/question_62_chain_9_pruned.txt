Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me read the question again.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, I remember that ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a triple bond connecting to another carbon, which is attached to another cyclohexane? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH substituent.

The target molecule's name is a bit complex. Let me break it down. It starts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same as the position where the aldehyde is attached. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the aldehyde is attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that ring has another substituent which is a methyl group bearing both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would have the cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde (CHO), and on the adjacent carbon (since it's 1-), there's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Oh well, in my mind, the target has two cyclohexane rings. One is the main ring with a CHO group. The other is attached via a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the molecule is:

cyclohexane-CHO with a substituent which is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or is the substituent on a different carbon? Wait, the name is 1-(substituent)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde, which is carbon 1. So the structure would be:

The cyclohexane ring has a carbon (C1
