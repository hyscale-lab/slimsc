Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian is related to the energy of a system. The question gives H as ε times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, right? Oh right, they're 2x2 matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's direction arbitrary but with magnitude 1.

I think the Pauli matrices are each a vector component. So the dot product would be sigma_x times n_x plus sigma_y times n_y plus sigma_z times n_z. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). 

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of H. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way since H is a spin operator. Oh right, maybe I can think of this as proportional to a spin component in the direction of n.

Each Pauli matrix is a spin operator multiplied by some constants. Oh right, the spin matrices for an electron (like S_x, S_y, S_z) are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So H is ε times the dot product, which would be ε times (n · σ ). So H = ε (n · σ).

Wait, for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component in any direction are ± ħ/2. So if H is proportional to (
