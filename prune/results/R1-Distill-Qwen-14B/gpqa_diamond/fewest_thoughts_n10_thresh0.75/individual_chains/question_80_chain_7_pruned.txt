Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what an algorithm does based on the given examples. Let's see. The examples given are:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And the question is, what value does ACAGTGACC give? The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I need to figure out the pattern or the rule the algorithm is using to convert the DNA sequences into numbers. Let's break this down.

First, I'll look at the first example: AGG gives 115. Let's write down what each nucleotide corresponds to in terms of their numerical values. In DNA, the bases are A, T, C, G. Sometimes in such problems, each base is assigned a number. For example, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, or something like that. Alternatively, sometimes it's based on their position in the alphabet: A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Wait, but let's check.

Wait, another approach: Maybe each base is treated as a digit in a base system. Like, each base represents a value, and the entire string is a number in a certain base, which is then converted to decimal.

Let me think. Each DNA base can be considered a digit. So perhaps it's treating the DNA string as a number in base 5 or something like that. Because there are four bases, so base 4 might make sense. Wait, but let's see.

Wait, let's calculate for the first example, AGG. If each letter is assigned a number: A=1, G=4, T=2, C=3. So AGG would be A=1, G=4, G=4. So the number would be 1,4,4 in some base. But what base?

Wait, if it's base 5 (since 5 is the number of digits when including 0), but let me see.

In the first example: AGG â†’ 115.

Wait, let's try base 4. Because there are four possible digits (A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3?), but wait, let's see.

If AGG is 115 in decimal, let's see what number it would be in base 4.

Wait, AGG in terms of digits: A, G, G. If A=0, G=3, so AGG would be 0*4^2 +3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 +12 +3 = 15. But the output is 115. So that's way off.

Alternatively, maybe each base is assigned a different value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. So the digits are 1,4,4. So the number would be 1 * something + 4 * something +4 * something.

If we consider base 5, then the number would be 1*5^2 +4*5^1 +
