Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta and figuring out the distance it travels from the galaxy's frame of reference. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially when objects are moving at high speeds, special relativity might come into play. But wait, the problem says we can ignore gravity and other motions, so maybe it's a straightforward velocity problem without relativity effects? Or do I need to consider time dilation?

Wait, the question says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But wait, that's a huge speed—like a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2 times that. So that's 20% the speed of light, which is pretty fast. So relativistic effects might be important here.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find out how much time that is in the galaxy's frame, and then multiply by the velocity to get the distance. Or maybe not? Because time would be different in each frame.

Wait, let's clarify. So in the ejecta's frame, their own time is moving at 50 seconds. We need to find how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame during that time, and then multiply by the velocity to get the distance. Because the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving towards the center, so the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s relative to the galaxy. Wait no, wait—wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities reverse when changing frames. So if the galaxy is moving at v towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy in the galaxy's frame. So v is 60,000 km/s.

So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. But the time experienced in the galaxy's frame might not be the same as the ejecta's frame. So we have to figure out the time that passes in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but how do we relate the two times? Oh, right, time dilation in special relativity. The time experienced in one frame is longer than the proper time in the other frame. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the event happens at the same place, so which frame is that here?

Wait, the event is the ejecta traveling for 50 seconds in its own frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the event is happening at the same point (the ejecta isn't moving in its own frame),
