Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated using the formula: IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, in this case, I need to consider the structure of the starting material and what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

Red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrohalogenation of carbonyl groups, but wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to methylene groups. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the Wolff-Kishner usually involves heating with a strong base and a hydride source. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a hydrohalogenation reaction.

Wait, maybe I should first draw the structure of the starting molecule. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So cyclohexene ring: positions 2 and 3 are double bonded (as in cyclohex-3-ene). At position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So position 2 is the formyl, position 5 is the vinyl (CH2=CH-), and the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Also, there's a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because the numbering would probably start at the substituent with the highest priority. Wait, the substit
