Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it again.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second. That doesn't look like a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? The vector's components squared should add up to 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them gives 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector is not normalized. I think I need to normalize it before proceeding. So the actual state vector |Ïˆ> would be (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). So each component is divided by sqrt(6).

Next, there are two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. Let me note down the matrices.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, Q's matrix looks like it's diagonal. So the eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues when the matrix is diagonal. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. And we need the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no. Wait the question says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So the first measurement is P, getting 0. Then, the second measurement is Q, getting -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state collapses after the first measurement, so the outcome of the second measurement depends on the state after the first. So I'll have to find the state after measuring P=0, and then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that state.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. So the first step is to find the possible eigenstates for P=0 and then see what the probability is for Q=-1 in those states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the scenarios in terms of the initial state. But first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P and Q.

Wait, but maybe I should start by finding the eigenvectors for operator P, especially for the eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P, the system collapses to an eigenvector of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. So if we measure P and get 0, the state after measurement is the corresponding eigenvector (up to normalization).

So first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P
