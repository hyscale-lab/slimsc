Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light inside it is moving in the same direction. But wait, isn't light supposed to move at c in a vacuum, but in glass it's slower?

Oh right, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium is always c when the medium is moving, but wait, no. Or is that only when the light is in the same frame as the medium? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of special relativity.

Wait, but if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and the light is moving through the medium at speed c/n relative to the medium, then what's the observed speed in the lab frame?

I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, because in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion.

Wait, but wait a second. The speed of light in the medium is u = c/n in the medium's frame. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the medium, the light's speed would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²).

But wait, wait. Let me make this clear. The medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So when we switch to the lab frame, we apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, the medium is moving towards the observer (since it's moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer). So the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity.

So, the velocity of the light in the medium's frame is u = c/n (in the direction of motion). Then, we calculate the velocity of the light in the lab frame using the velocity addition formula.

So, u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u * v)/(c²)].

But wait, what's the direction? Because if the medium is moving towards the observer (since the beam is moving toward the observer), then from the lab's perspective, the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So I think both u and v are in the same direction.

Wait, no. The light in the medium is moving at c/n in the direction of the beam. The medium itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity u' would be the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but only if the speeds are non-relativistic. But since c is a big number, perhaps here it's in terms of relativistic speeds, but the problem says v is a constant velocity. Maybe it's a non-relativistic case.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that v is small. So perhaps I should use the relativistic addition formula.

So, let's plug in u = c/n (since in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n). Then, the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the medium. Wait, wait, no. The medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the velocity addition is from the medium's frame to the lab frame.

Wait, the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the medium's frame, the lab is moving at -v. So when we calculate the speed of the light in the lab frame, we have to compute how the light's velocity transforms.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the medium's rest frame (let's call it frame S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the same direction as the medium's motion (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the medium's movement towards the observer). So from S' (the medium's frame), the light's velocity is u' = c/n in the positive x-direction.

The medium itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (frame S). So we need to find the velocity u of the light in frame S.

The velocity addition formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v) / c² ].

Wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is when you have a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S. Then, the velocity u' in S' becomes u = [u' + v]/[1 + (u' v)/(c²)] in S.

In this case, the medium's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S. So u' is the velocity in S', which is c/n. So plugging into the formula:

u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' * v) / c² ]

But u' is c/n, so:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator:

( c/n * v ) / c² = (v)/(n c)

So denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c )

So:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

Hmm, let's simplify this. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate the fractions.

Numerator: (c + n v ) * c = c² + c n v

Denominator: (1 * n c ) + v * c = n c + v c

Wait, no. Wait, denominator after multiplying by n c is:

[1 * n c + v * (n c )/(n c) ) ]? Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, let me write the denominator as [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ].

Wait, because 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So, putting it together:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is the same as [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel out in numerator and denominator:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

So u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, in the lab frame, the speed of light should be c. Because according to relativity, that's a fundamental postulate. But this formula suggests otherwise unless c (c + n v) / (n c + v ) equals c.

Let me check:

c (c + n v)/(n c + v ) = [ c² + c n v ] / (n c + v )

But the denominator is n c + v. Let’s factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, numerator: c² + c n v = c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = same as (c n + v )

Wait, so the expression is [c (c + n v ) ] / (c n + v )

So u = c (c + n v ) / (c n + v )

But (c + n v ) is not the same as (c n + v ). So this u is not equal to c.

Wait, that can't be right because according to relativity, the speed of light must be c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium.

So maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the velocity addition isn't the way to go here, or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: The speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, perhaps in the lab frame, the light's speed is still c/n, but that can't be because the medium is moving. Hmm, that can't be right either because the medium's movement should affect the observed speed.

But wait, according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the medium is moving, but the light is emitted within that medium, then the light's speed shouldn't be affected.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps this is a trick question. Because whether the medium is moving or not, the speed of light in the medium is c/n regardless of the medium's velocity. But that can't be because the medium's motion should affect the observed speed.

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties. So if the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame would still depend on the medium's motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame, but when the medium is moving, the lab frame would see a different speed.

Wait, but according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, it's not a vacuum—it's glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's frame.

So when the glass is moving, the lab frame sees the light moving at a different speed.

Let me try to model this correctly.

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the light's speed is u' = c/n.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S), so we can apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in S.

Velocity addition formula: u = [u' + v ] / [1 + (u' v )/(c² ) ]

Substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator:

( (c v )/(n c²) ) = v/(n c )

So denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So u = (c/(n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n c ) )

Let's factor out 1/c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by c to eliminate the fractions.

Numerator: (c/(n) + v ) * c → c²/n + c v

Denominator: (1 + v/(n c )) * c → c + v/(n )

So u = ( c²/n + c v ) / ( c + v/(n) )

Hmm, but this doesn't look like any of the options. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps factor out c from numerator and c from denominator.

Numerator: c ( c/n + v )

Denominator: c ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, but that doesn't help much.

Wait another approach: Let's factor n in the denominator.

Wait, denominator is (c + v/(n)) = (n c + v ) / n.

So denominator is (n c + v)/n.

So u becomes [ (c²/n + c v ) ] / [ (n c + v ) / n ]

Which is same as [ (c² + c v n ) / n ] * [ n / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel:

(c² + c v n ) / (n c + v )

Factor c from numerator:

c (c + v n ) / (n c + v )

Which is same as c (n v + c ) / (n c + v )

Wait, but the denominator is (n c + v ), and numerator is c (n v + c )

Hmm, but if I factor the denominator as (c n + v ), which is same as (n c +v ), and the numerator as c (n v + c ), which is same as c (c + n v ), is there a way to simplify this?

Wait, perhaps we can write numerator and denominator as:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = c (n ) + v.

Which doesn't seem to directly cancel. So u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

But how does this compare to the options given?

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Option B: 1.

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n - v )

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Hmm, none of them look like what I got. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the velocity addition but about the refractive index itself.

Wait, another approach: The glass is moving, but the speed of light in the glass is still c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. Because the refractive index is a property of the medium, not the motion. So in the lab frame, the speed would be c/n, but that would be option B if n=1, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, none of these are c/n unless n is 1, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the observed speed of light is not c/n, but depends on the movement of the medium.

Wait, but according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. But that's when the light is in a vacuum. Since this is a medium, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but wait, in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, but if the medium is moving, then in the lab frame, the speed would be different. So perhaps the observed speed is (c + v) / (1 + (c v)/c² ), but that's the relativistic addition when the medium is moving towards the light.

Wait, but in this case, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think in terms of the options.

The question is, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

So the options are all in terms of 1, which is c. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 1, but that would mean the speed is c regardless of the medium's motion, which contradicts my earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the glass remains c/n regardless of the glass's movement, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, so using Galilean addition. Then, the speed of light in the lab would be u = (c/n) + v.

But that would give a speed greater than c if v is positive, which is impossible in reality, but perhaps in this problem's context, it's considered.

But let's compute that: u = (c/n + v ). But that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible. Hence, that can't be.

But looking at the options, none of them are like that. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, but earlier when I computed it using the velocity addition formula, I got u = [ (c² + n c v ) ] / (n c + v )

But if I factor c from numerator and denominator, it becomes c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

Wait, that's the same as c (c + n v ) / (c n + v )

Hmm, not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the frame in which the light is moving at speed u' = c/n in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So the medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the light is moving at u' in the medium's frame.

Then, in lab frame, the light's speed is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So substituting u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c v)/(n c²) ) )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) /n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is same as [ (c + n v ) /n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel, so:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but again, this doesn't match any of the options. So I'm probably making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again, let's see.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

If I factor out c from numerator and denominator in my expression, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, let me rewrite my expression:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

u = [ (c + n v) ] / (n + v/c )

But that's not matching any option. Because the options have denominators like (n +v ), without dividing by c.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that v is much smaller than c, so v/c is negligible. Then, the denominator becomes approximately n.

So,

u ≈ (c + n v ) / n = c/n + v

But wait, that's the Galilean addition, but that's non-relativistic and would suggest u = c/n + v.

But none of the options directly match that either.

Wait, looking at option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

If I factor out 1 from numerator and denominator,

(1 +n v )/(n +v ) = [1(1) + n v ] / [ n + v ]

Which doesn't seem to directly relate to my expression. But if I let c=1, then my expression is:

u = [ (1 +n v ) ] / (n + v/c )

But if v is small, v/c ≈ 0, then denominator is n, so u ≈ (1 +n v)/n = 1/n + v.

Which is same as the Galilean addition result, but it's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the relativistic Doppler effect, but that's about frequency, not speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula where the speed in the moving medium is (c + v)/(n + (v/c) n ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Suppose the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass frame. When the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, the lab will see the light's speed as (c/n + v ) / (1 + (c v)/(n c²) )

Which is same as (c + n v )/(n + v )

Wait, wait, let me compute that.

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v )/(c²) )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( (c + n v ) /n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Which is same as (c +n v )/(n ) * (n c )/(n c + v )

So,

u = (c +n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Which is same as c (c +n v )/(n c + v )

Hmm, but how to match this to the options. Let me see. Let's write this as (c(c +n v )) / (n c +v )

Dividing numerator and denominator by c gives:

(c + n v ) / (n + v/c )

But again, this doesn't match any option because the options don't have v/c.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n, so when the glass is moving, the speed in lab frame is (c/n + v ) / [1 + (c v)/(n c²) ]

Which is [ (c +n v )/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (c +n v ) /n ] / [ (n c +v )/(n c ) ]

Which becomes [ (c +n v ) *c ] / [ (n c +v ) *1 ]

So u= c (c +n v ) / (n c + v )

Hmm, again, same result. None of the options seem to match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the speed to be c, because of the relativity postulate. But that would be option B. But that can't be right because the medium is moving, and the speed is measured in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed of light as c in the lab, which would be B. But that doesn't fit with the velocity addition.

Wait, another thought: The index of refraction n is a property of the medium. So when the medium is moving, does the index of refraction change? I think it doesn't. So the speed of light in the medium is c/n, as before.

But that would suggest the lab measures the speed as c/n, but that would be option B only if n=1. Which isn't the case here.

Wait, but the options don't have any c/n, but B is 1. So perhaps the correct answer is B, assuming that despite the medium's motion, the speed of light is c. But that's only true in a vacuum.

Wait, but the problem says the light is in the glass, not in a vacuum. So in that case, the speed of light in the glass's frame is c/n, and in the lab frame, it's different.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the speed in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

So, the light's speed in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v ) / ( 1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame.

If u' is c/n, then u = (c/n + v )/(1 + (c v)/(n c² )) = (c +n v )/(n + v )

Wait, wait, let me compute this carefully. Let me write u' = c/n.

Then,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c^2 )

Simplify denominator:

( (c v ) / (n c^2) ) = v/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c +n v )/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:

Numerator becomes (c +n v ) * c = c² + c n v.

Denominator becomes n c *1 + v = n c + v.

So,

u = (c² + c n v ) / (n c + v )

Factor numerator: c (c +n v )

Denominator: (n c + v )

So,

u = c (c +n v ) / (n c +v )

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, if I consider that the speed of light in the lab frame is c, but that's only possible if c (c +n v )/(n c +v ) equals c.

Let me check:

c (c +n v )/(n c +v ) = c → (c +n v ) = (n c +v )

Which would require c +n v = n c +v → c (1 -n ) + v (n -1 ) =0 → (1-n)(c -v )=0.

Which would only hold if either n=1 or v=c. But if n=1, then it's vacuum, and speed is c. But the problem states it's glass, so n>1.

Hmmm. So that's not possible, so my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the problem is intended to use the relative velocity without considering relativity, leading to a different approach.

Suppose that in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving at velocity u in the same direction as the glass.

So, from the lab frame, the light's speed is u = (c/n) + v.

But wait, that would give u = (c/n ) + v.

But if the problem assumes non-relativistic speeds, perhaps that's the approach. However, that would be option A if (c/n +v ) is written as (1 +n v)/(n +v ), but that's only possible if c=1 and n=1, which isn't the case.

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1. So let's substitute c=1.

So, u = (1/n + v ) / [ 1 + ( (1/n ) v ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, let's compute the expression I got when c=1.

u = (1 +n v ) / (n +v )

Because,

At c=1,

u = [ (1 +n v ) *1 ] / (n +v )

Which is option A.

Oh! Because when c=1, the expression becomes (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, that makes sense. So the correct answer is A. But earlier when I thought it didn't fit, I was forgetting that c is taken as 1 in the problem.

So, the correct answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to transform the velocity of light from the glass's rest frame to the laboratory frame:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

2. **Substitute \( u' = c/n \)**:  
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula gives:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to eliminate fractions:
   \[
   u = \frac{(c + n v)}{n + v}
   \]
   Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is:
   \[
   u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Substitute \( c = 1 \)**:  
   The problem specifies \( c = 1 \). Substituting \( c = 1 \) into the expression gives:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Match with the Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option A**:
   \[
   \text{Option A: } \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
