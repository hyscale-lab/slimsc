Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what each part involves.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each producing a product, and we need to match them to the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures for A, B, and C.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is called A.

I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a malonate ester. So, the malonate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2-C=O with a substituent. Wait, let me draw it. It's CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group on the other end of the double bond. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, maybe I should think about the structure.

Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl. No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the double bond placement. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR.
