Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid reaction, which is a type of acid-catalyzed cleavage, often used to break alkenes or other structures. But wait, I think more specifically, when alkenes react with HI, it's called hydrohalogenation, leading to the addition of HI across the double bond. But red phosphorus might be part of a different reaction. Oh wait! Wait, I recall that when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, that's for ketones. Or maybe it's used for deoxygenation. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used to convert alcohols to iodides, especially in the presence of H2SO4. Oh right, sometimes it's a way to get good leaving groups, like when making alkyl iodides from alcohols.

But wait, another possibility: the reaction of carbonyl groups. Oh right, the Clemmensen reduction! Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but wait, that's for reducing ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, maybe the Wolff-Kishner is for removing carbonyl groups, but that uses hydrazine and heat. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI might be part of a different reaction. Oh, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acid anhydride or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the cleavage of ethers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when alcohols react with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to get an alkyl iodide. Because red phosphorus is a good reducing agent. So if an alcohol has an -OH group, treating it with HI and red phosphorus would convert the -OH into an -I, right? Because the alcohol (ROH) reacts with HI via this mechanism: ROH + HI → RI + H2O. So perhaps the starting compound X has an alcohol group.

But looking at the options, the products don't seem to be alcohols. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid with a propyl group attached to a benzene ring at the para position.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group and a methyl in para positions.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Another carboxylic acid, with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group attached.

Wait, all the options are either benzoic acids or substituted toluenes. So perhaps the reaction is more about functional group transformations. Let me go back to the starting compound X.

The question gives IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at that. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region is usually O-H stretch, but maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But wait, 1720 is more in line with an ester or a ketone. If it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 3000, and the carbonyl around 1700, but the IR might show a broad peak around 3000 too. Hmm.

Wait, the IR also shows 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches. So X has aromatic rings. The NMR data can help.

The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's very high up, so likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but those are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak anywhere from 10-12, yes. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like two doublets each integrating to 2H. So probably a benzene ring with substituents in the para position. The next peak is at 2.9 ppm, m (1H). That might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

Wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggest a ethyl group attached to a CH, perhaps. Like a CH2CH2 group, but the triplet suggests a methyl group attached to
