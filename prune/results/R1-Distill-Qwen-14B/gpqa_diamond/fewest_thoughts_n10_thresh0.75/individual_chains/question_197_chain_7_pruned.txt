Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I should look at the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me determine the structure of X, which is crucial for predicting the reaction outcome.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group or possibly an amine, but since there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, that's more likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Could that be a ketone? Also, the absorbance around 1610 cm-1 might be a C=C stretch, which is common in aromatic rings. The 1450 cm-1 is probably from aromatic C-H bending or maybe some CH2 scissoring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H), which is a strong indicator of an -OH proton, like a phenolic -OH or maybe an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded, but they are usually a triplet or something else. Wait, but phenolic -OH protons are typically broader and can appear around 10 ppm. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid would also be around there, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR doesn't fit a carboxylic acid because those usually have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm-1 from O-H stretching, which is present here. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl and a broad O-H, maybe it's a ketone with a hydroxyl group nearby, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the IR shows 1720, which could be an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, the O-H stretching from the carboxylic acid would be around 2500-3000, but in this case, the IR has a peak from 3400-2500, which includes O-H. But in an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720, so that fits. But wait, in an ester, the O-H is from an acid, but in this case, maybe the compound is an ester with another -OH group? Or perhaps a ketone with an -OH elsewhere.

Wait, looking at the NMR's 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (1H) suggests it's an -OH group, maybe from a phenolic OH. Because if it were an aldehyde, it's probably more like a triplet or a doublet. So perhaps the compound has a phenol group.

Now, looking at the rest of the NMR. There's 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of protons, each with two equivalent H. For example, maybe a para-dimethyl group, but that would have different shifts. Alternatively, perhaps substituents in the para position causing the ring to have two sets of protons, each as doublets. The integration is 2H each, so four protons on the aromatic ring. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, a single substituent in the para position which causes the ring
