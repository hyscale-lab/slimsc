Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M. There are stability constants (β) provided for different cobalt thiocyanato complexes, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how strong a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the formation of each complex is stepwise. The first complex probably is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second might be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on. Wait, but I need to make sure what each β represents. Oh right, β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the general formula for each step is:

Co^{n+} + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_{n}]^{2+n - n}? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each step. Like, the first step is Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+, and β1 is the formation constant for that. The second step is [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}, with β2. Similarly, the third step is adding another SCN^- for [Co(SCN)₃]^3+, with β3=63. But wait, the fourth β is 16. Hmm, so maybe the fourth complex is [Co(SCN)₄]^4-? No, wait, Co is typically +2 or +3. Let me think, for Co²+, adding four SCN^- would give [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? But the β4 is lower than β3. That might mean that the third complex is more stable than the fourth.

Wait, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Blue color—so I'm thinking Co with two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+} would be the one in question. So we need the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+} relative to all species.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then find the percentage of the second one (dithiocyanato).

The total cobalt is 1e-2 M, but that's the total concentration of all species. The SCN- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, so we can probably assume that the solution has excess SCN-, so the formation of complexes is favored, especially higher order ones. But we need to calculate the distribution.

The general approach is to calculate the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stability constants. Because the complexes are formed stepwise, each step has its own β. So the formation of each complex depends on the previous steps.

Wait, but how do we model this? I think we can model it using the stepwise formation constants. The fraction of each complex can be determined by the product of the βs up to that step, divided by the sum of all products for each possible complex.

Alternatively, since the solution is at equilibrium, we can model the distribution of Co species using the β values and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

Let me outline the possible complexes:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (monomeric)
- [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+} (dimeric, the blue one)
- [Co(SCN)₃]^3+ (trimeric)
- [Co(SCN)₄]^2- (tet
