Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, and D, each with different structures.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The medium to strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are typically indicative of N-H stretches, especially for amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the molecule probably has an amide or an ester group. Since the options include both amides and esters, I'll keep that in mind.

Next, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet with three hydrogens. This is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet with two hydrogens. Broad signals in NMR can indicate exchange with protons, like in an amide where the NH protons are exchanging. So this might be an NH2 group, but wait, the options don't have amines with NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps an -OCH2- structure, but I'm not certain yet.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring group with two protons. The 4.5 ppm region is characteristic of an oxygenated CH2 group. For example, in an ester group like OCH2CO... Wait, but that's more like an ethyl ester. Wait, let me think. If we have an ethyl ester, the structure would be OCH2CH2O, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an amide. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: if the quartet is adjacent to a CH3, like in an ethyl group. So maybe the ethyl is attached to an oxygen. So, for example, OCH2CH2O something? Or maybe OCH2 attached to another group.

Looking at the aromatic region:

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)

A doublet for each, integrating to 2H each. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because para substituents would lead to two doublets each integrating to two protons. So the substituents are in the para positions.

Putting it together, the compound likely has a benzene ring with two
