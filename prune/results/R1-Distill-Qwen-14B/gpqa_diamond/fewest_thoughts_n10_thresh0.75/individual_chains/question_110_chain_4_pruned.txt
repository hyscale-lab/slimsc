Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions. But the key point is their brightness limits. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's worded is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits... It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Oh, so a star is observable by ESPRESSO if its apparent V magnitude is ≤17, and by HIRES if it's ≤16. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent V mag is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, the star must be brighter than 16, so only up to 16 mag. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16, since that's the stricter limit between 16 and 17. Because if V mag is ≤16, then both can see it. Because 16 is above ESPRESSO's limit (brighter than 17) and within HIRES's limit.

Wait wait, no. Wait, no. Because if a star's V mag is 16, then for ESPRESSO, since it can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (so up to 17, including 16), that's okay. For HIRES, it can observe stars brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag. So 16 mag is the limit. So any star with V mag ≤16 can be detected by both? Because 16 is within both's detectable range.

Wait, no, because for HIRES, the star must be brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. That means that only stars with V ≤17 can be observed. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is magnitude 17, it's the brightest (since lower numbers are brighter). Wait, no, that's not right. Magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=17 is fainter than a star with V=16. So, to be observable, a star must be brighter than 17 mag, which would be V <1
