Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about these instruments.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, does that mean it can detect stars brighter than 17 or fainter? Oh wait, brighter means smaller magnitude number. So higher magnitudes are fainter. So, if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, meaning less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same thing—brighter means mag less than or equal to 16. So HIRES can detect brighter stars than ESPRESSO because 16 is brighter than 17.

So each star needs to have apparent V magnitude (m_v) less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, but wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be observable by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So, the star's m_v must be ≤16. Because 16 is the stricter condition. Because if a star's m_v is 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16 <=17) and HIRES can also see it (16 <=16). But if a star has m_v of 17, HIRES can't see it (since 17>16), but ESPRESSO can.

So I need to find the stars whose apparent V magnitudes are ≤16. Because those are the ones that both can detect.

But wait, some of the stars have absolute magnitudes given, not apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for those.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: absolute V magnitude (M_v) is 15.5, distance is 1
