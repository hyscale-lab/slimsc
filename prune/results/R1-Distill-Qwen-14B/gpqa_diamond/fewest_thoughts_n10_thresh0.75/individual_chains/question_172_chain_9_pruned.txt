Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms in their atmospheres relates to the temperature of the star. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, the excitation level is about the population of higher energy levels compared to lower ones. So maybe the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given. 

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the ΔE. And I think the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the populations of two energy levels to temperature. 

The Boltzmann factor equation is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant. Wait, but if the atoms are twice as excited in star_1, I think that means n_upper/n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2, or maybe the other way around. Wait, let me think. If star_1 has higher excitation, that would mean more atoms in the higher energy level compared to the lower. So for star_1, n_upper/n_lower is higher than star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so does that mean that the excitation (like the number in the upper level) is twice as much for star_1? Or the ratio of upper to lower is twice as much? 

Assuming the ratio is twice. So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2. For star_2, maybe the ratio is 1? Or maybe not, because star_2 could have a different temperature. 

Wait, no, the problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio is 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2? Or maybe the ratio for star_2 is something else.

Let me get back to the Boltzmann equation. So for each star, the ratio is given by:
