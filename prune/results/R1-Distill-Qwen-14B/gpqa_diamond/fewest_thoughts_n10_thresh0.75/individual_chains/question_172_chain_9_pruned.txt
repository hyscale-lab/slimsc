Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're supposed to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Wait, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right? So that probably means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas. Oh right, the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(- (E_i - E_j)/(k T)), where n_i is the number of particles in state i, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so let's denote E_diff = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for star_1, the population n1 is twice that of star_2, n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait wait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, it's about the same energy levels for both stars. So for each star, the energy difference is the same, E_diff. So for star_1, (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( - E_diff/(k T1) ), and for star_2, (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( - E_diff/(k T2) ). 

But the problem states that in star_1, the specific energy level is twice as excited. So maybe n1_upper is twice as much as n2_upper? Or wait, maybe the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is different. Because the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms is twice as high in star_1. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is 2 times higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Let me clarify. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) and for star
