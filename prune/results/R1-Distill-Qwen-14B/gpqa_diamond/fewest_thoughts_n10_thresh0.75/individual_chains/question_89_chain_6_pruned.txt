Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and spectroscopy questions.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite positions of this structure.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base. Since it's dibromo, probably an elimination reaction is happening here. Wait, no—wait, KOH could also cause substitution. But given that it's heated, I'm more leaning towards elimination. But wait, wait—adamantane is a very rigid structure. So, when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo in adamantane, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the structure, perhaps. Let me think. Wait, adamantane has four rings, and 1 and 3 positions are adjacent, right? So when you eliminate HBr from two adjacent carbons, you get an alkene.

So, the product after KOH would be 1,3-diamantadiene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait a minute, when dihalides are treated with a base like KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction, they form alkenes. So the product might be an adamantadiene, but the description says 'light yellow solid product 1.' Also, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, that doesn't fit an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another possibility is substitution. But with KOH, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons. If each Br is treated with KOH, perhaps we get a diol? But that would require two substitutions. However, when you substitute a bromine with OH, you get an alcohol. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe it's not substitution but something else.

Oh, wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, would that form an allene or something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring expansion or something else. Wait, but the product's IR has a carbonyl, so maybe the product is a ketone?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Let me think about the possible reactions. Oh! Wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can undergo a double elimination, removing two equivalents of HX. But if it's vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridged structure, perhaps forming a ketone.

Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of beta-elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used in a double elimination, perhaps it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. How? Because elimination could form a carbonyl via some kind of dehydrohalogenation with adjacent leaving groups.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. Vicinal dihalides can undergo elimination to form alkenes, as I thought before. But if the dihalide is on the same carbon, maybe that's different. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromo in adamantane means the two Br are on adjacent carbons in the structure. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. But the IR shows a carbonyl, not a C=C. So perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, another possibility comes to mind: the formation of a ketone via elimination. But how? Maybe dehydration? No, dehydration is usually for alcohols. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond, but perhaps the structure is such that it could form a bridge, leading to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the base causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me look at the NMR data given for product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So 4.79 is probably an -OH group, but wait, in D2O, OH protons would exchange and not appear. But maybe it's an ether or an alcohol. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone. But an -OH in the NMR would show a broad peak around that region, but 4.79 is more like an ether or maybe an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretch, which would be around 3300 cm⁻¹. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe the product is a diketone.
