Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. From what I remember, when a dibromide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. That makes sense because dibromides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, the product 1 would probably be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Oh wait, but wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So eliminating two Brs would form a double bond between those carbons.

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, but product 1 was formed by dehydrohalogenation, which should give an alkene. Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, elimination of two HBr molecules would form an alkene. But the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more typical of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. That's confusing. Did I misidentify the reaction?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing another possibility. Could it be a ring-opening or something else?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene? No, 1,3-dibromo would give a single double bond. So the product is an adamantane with a double bond. But then why the IR has a carbonyl peak? Unless the product isn't just an alkene but something else.

Wait, let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when treated with KOH, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a conjugated diene? No, because 1,3 positions are separated by one carbon in adamantane, so elimination would form a single double bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm forgetting about other possible products. Could it be a substitution? If KOH is in excess, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, if I eliminate two HBr, I get a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar.

But the NMR doesn't fit an alkene. The 4.79 ppm peak is around where a CH₂ group attached to something electronegative might be. Like an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but KOH is a strong base; maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, I don't
