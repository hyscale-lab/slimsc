Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that the divergence of a vector field is a scalar field, and the volume integral of the divergence is related to the flux through the surface via the divergence theorem. Wait, divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward normal to the surface.

But wait, the problem isn't giving me the flux directly. So maybe I should compute the divergence first and then integrate it over the volume. Alternatively, using the divergence theorem could simplify things because the volume is a sphere, which is a nice, simple shape.

Let me think about how the vector field is defined. It's only in the radial direction, so in spherical coordinates, the vector field f would have components (f_r, 0, 0). So in spherical coordinates, the divergence formula is a bit different than in Cartesian. I recall that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field (A_r, A_θ, A_φ) is (1/(r² sinθ)) [d(A_r r² sinθ)/dr + d(A_θ r sinθ)/dθ + d(A_φ)/dφ]. But wait, in this case, since the field only has a radial component, the other components (θ and φ) are zero. So the divergence reduces to (1/(r² sinθ)) * d(A_r r² sinθ)/dr. Wait, no, because A_θ and A_φ are zero, the terms for θ and φ will vanish. So let's compute that.

Given that f is radial only, the divergence becomes (1/(r²)) * d(f_r r²
