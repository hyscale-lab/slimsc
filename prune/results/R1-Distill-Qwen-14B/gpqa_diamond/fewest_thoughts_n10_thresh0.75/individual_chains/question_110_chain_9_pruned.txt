Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But the key difference here is their brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars up to about 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, to be detected by both, a star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 mag (since 17 is fainter than 16, so if it's brighter than 17, it's definitely brighter than 16). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. But wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, both can see it? No, wait. Let me think again. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that's apparent V ≤ 17. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is apparent V ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V must be ≤16. Because ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so any star that's brighter than 16 (i.e., V <16) can be seen by both. Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. So, if a star is brighter than 17, that's V <17. So for ESPRESSO, it's V <17. For HIRES, it's V <16. So the overlap is V <16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both. But wait
