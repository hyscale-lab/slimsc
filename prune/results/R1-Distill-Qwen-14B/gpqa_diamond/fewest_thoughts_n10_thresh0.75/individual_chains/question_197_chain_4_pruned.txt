Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI elimination reaction, which usually deoxygenates certain functional groups. Like, I think it's used for the elimination of alcohols to form alkenes, especially when dealing with secondary or tertiary alcohols. But wait, it's also used for the conversion of ketones or esters into alkenes through the elimination of water or other leaving groups. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn-Hg and HCl, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But this is red phosphorus and HI, so that's the situation where maybe a carbonyl group is being converted into an alkene.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The given data is IR and 1H NMR.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually suggests O-H or N-H stretching. But the broadness might indicate an O-H, like a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or a ketone with a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H, which could be an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a phenolic -OH? But phenols have lower shifts, like around 5 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde proton.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But the
