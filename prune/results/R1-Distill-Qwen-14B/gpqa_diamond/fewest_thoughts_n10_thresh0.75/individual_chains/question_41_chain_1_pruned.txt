Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. Oh, but the light is also moving towards the observer? Or is it that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement, which is towards the observer. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, but the light is in the glass. So, the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction is n, so speed v_light = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The speed of light remains c in any inertial frame. But wait, is this a relativistic scenario? Because if the glass is moving at velocity v, but v is presumably much smaller than c, can we use a non-relativistic approach?

Wait, the question probably expects using the Galilean transformation, assuming v is small compared to c. Because otherwise, it would have to involve Lorentz transformations, which would complicate things a lot, and the answer options don't look like they're involving any square roots or things like that. So, I'll assume non-relativistic speeds here.

So, the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass itself. Because if the glass is moving, then any object in it would be moving with it. So, the observer would see the light moving at (c/n) + v?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer. So, if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity (which is towards the observer
