Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says the dye emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. I remember that when a substance emits light, it's because the electrons have jumped down an energy level, right? So the energy difference between those levels corresponds to the photon emitted.

Wait, but the question is about the color of light absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. I think the absorbed light is the one that causes the electrons to get excited in the first place. So the emitted light's energy is lower than the absorbed because when electrons drop, they emit a photon with energy equal to the difference.

So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. To find the absorbed energy, I need to figure out the energy gap. Wait, no, I think I might be getting confused. Wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, the electron jumps up. The energy of that photon is the energy gap between the ground state and excited state. Then, when it emits, it's a lower energy photon, maybe. Or wait, I might be mixing up things.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the state it drops to. But for absorption, the photon's energy must match the energy required to excite the electron from the ground to the excited state. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one, right? Because the emission comes from a lower transition.

Wait, no
