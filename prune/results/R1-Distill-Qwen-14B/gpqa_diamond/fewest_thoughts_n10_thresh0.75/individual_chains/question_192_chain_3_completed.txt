Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R and a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, I think the cavity is non-conducting because it's just a cavity, right? So when we place a charge +q inside, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall. So the inner surface of the conductor will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance the neutral condition.

Wait no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, by Gauss's law, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q.

But I'm not sure if the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the outer surface charge distribution. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface should distribute uniformly, right? Because any external electric fields would cause the charges to rearrange. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so its outer surface should be a conductor, so charges can move freely. So the outer surface would have a uniform charge, +q.

Wait, but wait another thing. The cavity is offset, the center is not at the same point as the conductor's center. So the inner surface of the conductor won't be uniformly charged. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge distribution that's like a mirror image of the +q charge. But how does that affect the outer surface?

Wait, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. The outer surface is a conductor, so the charges there can move freely. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, but their distribution—does it matter?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step. First, what happens when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor.

1. The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge won't be symmetric. The inner surface charge will be like a dipole or something? Or maybe it's symmetric around the point where the charge is placed.

Wait, no. The inner surface's charge distribution depends on the position of the charge. Since the charge is inside the cavity, which is a sphere, the inner surface will adjust such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Because conductors have E=0 inside.

So the inner surface must arrange its charge in such a way that the field from +q and the inner surface charge cancels inside the conductor. But how?

Alternatively, think about the electric field inside the conductor. It must be zero. So the field from the charges inside the cavity (the +q) must be canceled by the induced charges on the inner surface.

Wait, but the conductor's inner surface is a sphere, but the charge +q is at a different point. So the inner surface's charge distribution would be such that the field inside the conductor is zero.

But I'm not exactly sure how the position affects the outer surface.

Wait, but the outer surface is a conductor. So any external fields would cause the charges to move, but in this case, since the conductor is isolated, the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. Because the conductor shields the outer surfaces from the inner charge.

Wait, I recall that in a conductor, the charges on the outer surface depend only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the total enclosed charge. But in this case, the cavity has a charge +q, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

But wait, does the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the outer surface charge distribution?

Wait, another thought: The cavity is inside the conductor, so the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, but the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity.

So the outer surface is uniformly charged with +q because it's a sphere. Because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely. So the outer surface of the conductor must have a uniform charge density.

So, when I'm considering the electric field outside the conductor at point P, the field would be as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has +q uniformly distributed, the field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the electric field at a point outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so it's at a distance L from the center. So the field is due to the +q on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed. So for a point outside, the field is as if the charge is at the center.

But wait, the problem states that the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is offset from the center. Does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? I thought it doesn't because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform.

But wait, maybe I'm wrong. If the conductor is a sphere, then the outer surface would have uniform charge regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity. Because the conductor's inner surface would adjust to cancel the internal fields, ensuring E=0 inside the conductor. Then the outer surface's charge distribution depends only on the total charge, not the position.

So the electric field outside the conductor at P would be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the center. So then the E field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

But wait, another angle: The problem says that the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and L is the distance from the conductor's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

So perhaps the field isn't as straightforward as I thought. Because the charge is placed off-center, maybe the field at P depends on the position.

Wait, but the outer surface of the conductor has +q uniformly distributed. So when you're outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge is at the center. Because of the spherical symmetry. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the outer field. So the field at P depends only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor.

So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged. So regardless of where the internal charge is, the external field is the same as a point charge at the conductor's center.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**: The conductor is initially uncharged, with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ and center separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

3. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, and charges on a conductor redistribute freely to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface distributes uniformly, independent of the position of $+q$ inside the cavity.

4. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a uniformly charged spherical surface, the electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the sphere. Therefore, at a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

5. **Field Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]

6. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the charge inside the cavity (offset by $s$) and the angle $\theta$ between $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) and $s$ do not affect the external field. The uniform charge distribution on the outer surface ensures that the field outside depends only on $L$.

7. **Correct Option**: Comparing with the given options, the correct expression for the electric field is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
