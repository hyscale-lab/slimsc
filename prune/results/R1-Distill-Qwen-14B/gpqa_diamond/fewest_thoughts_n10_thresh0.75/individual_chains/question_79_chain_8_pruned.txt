Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem describes an experiment where Compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify Compound X from the options provided.

Wait, wait. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Hofmann elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination typically occurs in amines, usually secondary or tertiary amines, in the presence of a strong base. But wait, this molecule is reacting with a nonpolar solvent and heat. Oh, right, Hofmann elimination involves heating, so this setup makes sense.

So, the reaction is likely an elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination typically converts amines into alkenes. Wait, but the starting material here is Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. Let me see, an epoxide? Because the product after Hofmann elimination would form an alkene. But wait, the product's NMR is provided, so perhaps we need to look at that.

Let me look at the NMR data.

First, the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

The 13C NMR:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Hmm. Looking at the 13C NMR, I see a peak around 197 ppm, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, but the product is from an elimination reaction, so perhaps it's an epoxide opening? Or maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction leads to something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. Hofmann elimination of a cyclic amine, say, an epoxide derived from an amine? Wait, no. Hofmann elimination is for amines. Oh, wait a minute, another thought: epoxide ring opening under certain conditions. But the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong base, like a crown ether, and it's used in elimination reactions.

Wait, but if the starting material is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, maybe it would open the epoxide. But wait, the product's 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7. That's a high value, maybe a ketone or an ester. Wait, but if Hofmann elimination is happening, the product is an alkene. So maybe the starting material is an epoxide with adjacent substituents that can undergo elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't an epoxide but another compound, and after reaction with the base, an epoxide is formed. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the reaction is an elimination reaction. So the starting material must have adjacent leaving groups or a structure that allows elimination.

Wait, but Compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0. So (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees of unsaturation. Which could be three rings and three double bonds, but more likely a combination like two rings and four double bonds, or a ring and five double bonds. Wait, more realistically, one ring (like a benzene ring, which is three double bonds) and some other rings or double bonds. Benzene accounts for 4 degrees (3 from the ring, 1 from each double bond), so remaining 2 degrees could be another ring and a double bond, or two more double bonds. Hmm.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is a vinyl benzene. Oxirane is an epoxide. So formula would be C9H8O (styryl is C8H7, oxirane adds an O and two carbons? Wait, no. Wait, styryl is C6H5CHCH2-, so 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would be oxirane (3 carbons: O connected to two CH2 groups?), Wait, no. Let me think. Oxirane is a three-membered ring with O. So 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would have the structure where the oxirane is connected to the styryl group. So the styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached, and the vinyl is connected to the oxirane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C-O-C connected to the styryl group.

Wait, maybe. So the formula would be C9H8O? Or wait, let me calculate. Styryl is C8H7 (since it's C6H5-CH=CH2), but in the oxirane, it's connected to the ring, so maybe the formula is C11H12O. Because, let's see: styryl is C8H7. Oxirane is O and two carbons (epoxide). So the oxirane is connected to the styryl, so overall formula would be C8+2 from oxirane + maybe another methyl? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the oxirane is part of a larger structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)ox
