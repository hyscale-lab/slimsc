Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function of a system with three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, so I have to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin is either +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. 

Wait, but it's easier maybe to think in terms of the possible values of the energy. The energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Since each term in the energy is S_i S_j, which can be either +1 or -1.

So the energy E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute what each term can be.

Each of the three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be +1 or -1. So the sum of these three terms can vary. Let me think about the possible sums.

Wait, for each pair, S_i S_j = +1 if the spins are aligned, and -1 if anti-aligned. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, I suppose. Let me check.

Wait, what's the maximum possible sum? All three pairs are aligned. So S1=S2=S3=+1: S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is +1 again, so sum is 3. So the maximum sum is 3.

What about two aligned, one not? Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. Wait, no, 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Hmm.

Wait, another case: two terms +1 and one -1. Let's see. For example, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1= -1. So another case where sum is -1.

What about if two are -1 and one +1? Let's see: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. So S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1. So same as before.

Wait, when is the sum 1? Let me think
