Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small region is in equilibrium and follows the usual thermodynamic laws, including the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for particles.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula I recall is:

n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number densities of particles in energy levels i and j.
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- k_B is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the iron atoms are in specific energy levels. Let's say star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is 2:1 for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, where n is the number in the excited state. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Let me recheck. Oh, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2." So maybe n1 = 2 n2?

Wait, but no, maybe I should model it as for each star, the ratio of excited state to some lower state. But the problem says the energy difference between the levels is about 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps the two levels are E1 and E2, with E1 - E2 = Î”E.

Wait, but each star has its own temperature, so for star 1 and star 2, the ratio of the populations
