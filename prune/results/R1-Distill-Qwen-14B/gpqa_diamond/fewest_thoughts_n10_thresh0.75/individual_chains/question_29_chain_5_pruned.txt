Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for synthesizing this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found mutations in the target gene, specifically at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. We need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, so the idea is that if the gene is not functioning properly, the compound won't be synthesized. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. That usually means a loss-of-function mutation. Common types are missense, nonsense, frameshift, or maybe a splice site mutation.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the DNA sequence. The original gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So let's compare each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Comparing to the intact gene, let's see where it changes. Original starts with ATGTTT, then CTCGCT. In Mutant 1, after ATGTT, it's CTACGCT. So the fourth base in the original is T, in mutant 1 it's C. So the change is from T to C at position 4. Let me check the codons. The original first few codons: ATG is methionine (start), then TTT is Phe, then CTC is Leu, then GCT is Ala, etc. In Mutant 1, the second codon becomes CTG? Wait, no. Wait, let's see: the original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA etc. Wait, looking at the first few bases:

Intact gene: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAA... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me count each base.

Original: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA... 

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C... 

Wait, maybe I should write out the changes. Let me break the sequences into codons.

Original first 8 codons:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24),
