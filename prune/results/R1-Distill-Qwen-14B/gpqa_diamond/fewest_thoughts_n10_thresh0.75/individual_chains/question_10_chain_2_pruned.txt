Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d. Each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth has a mass of about 5.97 x 10^24 kg and a radius of around 6,371 km. The density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet has the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is given directly here. So if the density is the same as Earth, 5.5, then this planet's density is the same as Earth's. But wait, does mass affect density? Well, density is mass/volume. If the mass doubles but the volume also changes, maybe because the radius is different, then the density might stay the same. But in this case, the density is given, so regardless of mass, this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth would mean the same density as Earth, right? Because composition affects both mass and volume. If it's five times more massive, assuming it's a scaled-up version, the radius would be larger. Let's think about scaling. If Earth's radius is R, then scaling mass by a factor would change the radius by cube root of (mass scaling). So for mass 5 times, radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. The volume would be proportional to R^3, so if mass is 5 times and volume is (cube root 5)^3 = 5, then density would be 5/5 = 1, same as Earth's. Wait, no, because Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density would also be 5.5, same as Earth. So this planet's density is same as Earth.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same reasoning. If it's same composition, same density. So the mass is halved
