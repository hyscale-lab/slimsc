Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes involve some complex calculations, especially with phase shifts involved. Let me think about this.

Wait, the question gives me phase shifts δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4, and tells me to ignore the rest. The values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. The incident electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that energy matters directly here. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction, which I think relates to the differential cross-section.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in terms of the phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum ( ... ), but wait, more specifically, when you have partial waves, each contributes with a term involving the spherical Bessel functions and the phase shifts. But wait, maybe along the direction of the incident beam, which is θ=0. So I might need to find the limit as θ approaches 0.

Wait, when θ is zero, the direction is along the beam, so the scattering angle is 0 degrees. The formula for the scattering amplitude in the case of θ=0 must have a specific form. Let me think: the general expression when you have phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/k) [ (1 + 2i sum (something with δ_l) ) ] or something along those lines. Alternatively, I remember that the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) [ e^{2iδ_0} P_0(cosθ) + sum_{l=1}^\infty ( ... ) ].

Wait, when θ is zero, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, but for higher l, it's also 1 for l=0, but wait no, P_l(1) is 1 for all l because they are polynomials evaluated at x=1. So at θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l.

But wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by f(0) = (
