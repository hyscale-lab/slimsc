Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and its spectrum, and I need to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let's try to break it down.

The question says that when observing a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, right! That must be the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. But wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, right? So maybe this peak is from another transition.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Let's think about the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, so 790 is in the near-infrared. Oh, wait, that's the near-infrared C band or something. Hmm, but how does this relate to redshift?

Oh, I remember that emission lines from quasars can be used to determine redshift. The peak at 790 nm would correspond to a rest-frame wavelength. Let's see, for example, if the rest wavelength is λ0, then the observed wavelength λ = λ0*(1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So, I need to figure out what rest wavelength would correspond to 790 nm when observed. But wait, what feature is this? Common emission lines include Lyman-alpha (121 nm), hydrogen alpha (656 nm), etc. Wait, 790 nm is longer than 656, so maybe it's a hydrogen Paschen line or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman limit or another transition. Wait, maybe the Lyman series is in the UV, so in the rest frame. But if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is infrared, then the quasar must be at a high redshift. Because 790 nm observed would mean a longer wavelength, so higher z.

Let me think about the rest wavelength. Let's say the emission line is at 790 nm in the observed frame, but what is its rest wavelength? If it's a near infrared peak, perhaps it's from a forbidden line, like [OIII] or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break, where the Lyman series transitions go from UV to optical or infrared.

Wait, the Lyman series transitions for hydrogen are all in the UV. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the optical/near-IR, then the quasar must be at a high redshift so that the rest UV line is redshifted into the optical. Oh, right, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm in rest frame. If in the observed frame it's at 790 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z≈5.5. Wait, that would make a high redshift.

But wait, the question says that at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, the flux drops significantly. So maybe the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha emission line redshifted into the near-IR. So that would imply a redshift z ≈ (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 6.5-1=5.5.

Wait, but let's calculate that accurately. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.499. So 1 + z = 6.499 → z ≈5.499, which is about z=5.5.

Now, knowing the redshift, I can find the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c / H(a) da, where a is the scale factor, and H(a) is the Hubble parameter at scale factor a.

The Hubble parameter H(a) is given by H0 * sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda), where H0 is the Hubble constant, Ω_m is the matter density parameter, and Ω_lambda is the dark energy (dark energy density parameter) which is 1 - Ω_m - Ω_r, but in this case, since it's a flat universe (Ω_k=0), Ω_lambda is 0.7.

So H(a) = H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

But since I'm integrating over a from 0 to 1 (since a=1 now), the comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)) dz', where z' is the variable.

Wait, but integrating
