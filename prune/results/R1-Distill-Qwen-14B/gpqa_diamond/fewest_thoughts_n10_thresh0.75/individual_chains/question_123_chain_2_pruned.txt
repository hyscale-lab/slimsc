Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question says both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames don't accelerate, so no forces or anything. So we can probably use special relativity here since the speeds are highâ€”like 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2c. So, relativistic effects might matter, but maybe this is a simple problem.

The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so wait, how do reference frames affect time and distance here?

I remember something about time dilation and length contraction. Since the two frames are moving relative to each other, time intervals and lengths can appear different.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because if one frame is moving at v towards another, the other is moving at -v in the first's frame.

So the problem is asking, in the Galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta move in 50 seconds of ejecta time. Wait,
