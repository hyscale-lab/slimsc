Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, that's one of the crystal systems. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but wait—rhombohedral crystals have a specific structure. Oh right, a rhombohedral unit cell is a special case where all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

The problem asks about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. Oh wait, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something involving the angles? Or wait, no, maybe it's using the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, maybe it's better to start from the basics. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(h l cos β) - 2(k l cos α) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ, which is 30 degrees here. Also, since it's a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a cube that's been skewed along all axes equally. So all a, b, c are equal. So a = b = c = let's say 'a'. But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Hmm, how does that relate to 'a'?

Wait, wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure might be along the edges. So if each edge is 'a', then the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'. So a = 10 Angstroms. Or maybe not? Because in a cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in rhombohedral, the edges are a, but the nearest neighbor distance could be along the diagonals. Hmm, no, I think in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices of the unit cell, so nearest neighbors are along the edges. So the edge length a is the interatomic distance. So in this case, a = 10 Angstroms.

So, α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the interplanar distance formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 cos γ) - 2*(1*1 cos β) - 2*(1*1 cos α) )

Wait, but since α=β=γ=30°, each cos term becomes cos(30°). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (3) - 2*(1*1*(sqrt(3)/2)) *3 )

Because each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl) is 1*1 cos α, but since all three angles are same, so we have:

Denominator = sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, let me recalculate that. The expression inside the square root is sum of h² + k² + l² minus 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α.

But since γ = β = α =30°, each cos term is same. So:

Sum h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

Each term 2hk cos θ: since h=1, k=1, it's 2*1*1 *cos(30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3). But there are three such terms: hk, hl, kl. So total 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, that can't be right. Because 3 - 3*1.732 is 3 -5.196= negative number. Wait, no, that can't be. Because then the square root of a negative number, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, wait, maybe I mixed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar spacing in a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with unit cell parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2 hk (cos γ)/(a b) ) - 2 hl (cos β)/(a c) ) - 2 kl (cos α)/(b c) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α=β=γ=θ. So substituting:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - 2 hk (cos θ)/(a0²) - 2 hl (cos θ)/(a0²) - 2 kl (cos θ)/(a0²) )

Factor out 1/a0² from the square root:

d = 1 / [ sqrt( (h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ ) ) / a0 ) ]

Which can be written as:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ )

So, for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So denominator inside sqrt is:

3 - 2*1*1*(cos 30) *3 terms.

Wait, no, each pair hk, hl, kl. So 3 terms, each contributing 2*1*1*cos30.

So 3 * 2 * cos30 = 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )= 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196. So 3 - 5.196 is negative, which would make the sqrt of a negative number. That can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, maybe I had the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ )

Wait, but in that case, with α=β=γ=30°, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3*(2*1*1*cos30)).

Wait, 3 (from h² +k² + l²) plus 3 terms, each 2*1*1*cos30. So that's 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 + 3*sqrt(3).

Because 2* (sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3). So 3 terms of that would be 3*sqrt(3), which is about 5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Since a is 10 Angstroms, d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49. Wait, but that's way smaller than any of the options given, which are all around 9-10 Angstroms. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Let me check. The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a/(2π))^2 + (k b/(2π))^2 + (l c/(2π))^2 - 2 hk (cos γ a b)/(2π)^2 ) - 2 hl (cos β a c)/(2π)^2 ) - 2 kl (cos α b c)/(2π)^2 ) )

But perhaps another approach is better. There's another formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps using the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been deformed. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g in a rhombohedral system is given by:

g = [
  a²        0          0
  0        a²        a² cos γ
  0        a² cos γ   a²
]

Wait, but wait, the exact form might depend on the angles. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the Miller indices.

Wait, another formula I've heard of is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but that would be for a hexagonal system, I think. But in our case, α=β=γ=30°, so let's plug in.

h = k = l = 1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 1 +1 +1 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30.

Which is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d = a / 2.863 ≈10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. But that's way too small compared to the options given, which are all around 9-10. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems because all angles are the same. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that involves the unit cell volume. The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²θ + 2 cos³θ), where θ is the angle (30° in this case).

The volume is important because it's used in the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, but maybe another approach: the interplanar distance can be calculated using the plane's normal vector. For a (111) plane, the normal vector has components (1,1,1).

In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors can be represented as:

a1 = a * (1,0,0)
a2 = a * (cos γ, sin γ, 0)
a3 = a * (cos β, (cos α - cos β cos γ)/(sin β), sin β )

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the vector approach.

The plane (111) has a normal vector n = (1,1,1). The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector in reciprocal space. But reciprocal space vectors are a bit tricky.

Wait, the reciprocal basis vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0)
b2 = (2π/a) (0, 1, 0)
b3 = (2π/a) (0, 0, 1)

Wait, but no, in a skewed system, the reciprocal vectors are more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )) ), but considering the angles correctly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me see if I can find a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the key is to compute the reciprocal of the (111) plane. The reciprocal lattice vectors can be used to find d.

Wait, another formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 hk cos θ - 2 hl cos θ - 2 kl cos θ ) ) * (a) )

Wait, that's similar to what I had before, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume of the unit cell. Because the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²θ + 2 cos^3θ ), where θ is 30°. Let's compute that.

cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So compute 1 -3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3.

Compute each term:

3*(0.8660)^2 = 3*(0.75) = 2.25.

2*(0.866)^3 ≈ 2*(0.6495) ≈1.299.

So 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 = 1 -2.25= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 * 0.221.

So V ≈ (10)^3 * 0.221 = 1000 *0.221=221 Angstrom^3.

Wait, the volume is 221 Ang^3.

But how does that help me find the interplanar distance? Hmm.

Wait, the volume is needed for the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vector components can be found using the formula:

b1 = (2π/a) (1,0,0)
b2 = (2π/a) (0,1,0)
b3 = (2π/a) (0,0,1)

Wait, no, that's only for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are more complicated.

Alternatively, the (hkl) plane's reciprocal vector is given by (h, k, l) scaled by 2π. But perhaps that's getting too involved.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d = (1/√( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) ) * (1/√( (1/a²)(1/b²)(1/c²) + terms )) )

Wait, no, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the vector in reciprocal space. The plane (hkl) has a normal vector in reciprocal space of (h, k, l) multiplied by 2π.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

I remember that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the formula is different because of the angles.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for a rhombohedral system (all a=b=c, angles α=β=γ=θ) is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but wait, if all angles are θ, then the formula would have all the cosine terms as cosθ, so:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but in that case, for (111), let's compute the denominator.

h=k=l=1, θ=30°.

Denominator: 1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 * cos30)*3.

Wait, 1+1+1=3.

2*(cos30)*(3 terms) = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3*sqrt(3).

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d= a / 2.863 = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9-10. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula backward. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

But that would result in sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)) which is sqrt(negative), which is impossible.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the formula for the distance between planes with the reciprocal space. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse.

Wait, I think I need to revisit the formula. Let me check my notes.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ )

Wait, but in our case, α=β=γ=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*(1*1 * cos30)*3.

Which is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 -3*sqrt(3).

Wait, 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3-5.196= -2.196. That's a negative number. Can't take square root of that. So this can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ )

But then for (111), it's 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 +3*sqrt(3)=8.196. So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But that's way too small. Our options are around 9-10, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is different because the unit cell is rhombohedral. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the plane's intercepts and the unit cell dimensions.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance given isn't 'a', but the nearest neighbor distance, which might be different. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a', but in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps 'a' is 10 Angstroms. So my initial assumption was correct.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Let me think of another way.

Wait, another approach: The Miller indices (hkl) define the plane, and the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space.

In reciprocal space, the vectors are given by (h, k, l) scaled by 2π/d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector magnitude.

The (111) plane has a normal vector in real space of (1,1,1) multiplied by 'a' (since the lattice vectors are along the axes, but scaled by 'a').

Wait, but the unit cell is rhombohedral, so the real-space lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, but with angles between them.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model this in terms of vectors.

Let me define the lattice vectors as:

a1 = a * (1, 0, 0)
a2 = a * (cosθ, sinθ, 0)
a3 = a * (cosθ, (cosθ - cosθ cosθ)/sinθ, sinθ )

Wait, simplifying a3:

Wait, another approach: the third vector a3 can be written as a*(cosθ, 0, sinθ) if the angle between a1 and a3 is θ, and similarly for a2 and a3.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal vectors b1, b2, b3 are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1, 0, 0)
b2 = (2π/a) * (0, 1, 0)
b3 = (2π/a) * (0, 0, 1)

But in a rhombohedral system, this isn't correct because the axes are not orthogonal.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1, 0, 0) / (volume) ?

No, perhaps I should use the formula for reciprocal vectors in terms of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy the condition a_i · b_j = δ_ij.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [
a^2, a^2 cosθ, a^2 cosθ
a^2 cosθ, a^2, a^2 cosθ
a^2 cosθ, a^2 cosθ, a^2
]

So the reciprocal metric tensor g' is the inverse of g.

The reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3 can be found such that g'_{ij} = (b_i · b_j )/( (2π)^2 )

So for the (111) plane, the reciprocal vector is (1,1,1).

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance d is related to the magnitude of the reciprocal vector.

The reciprocal vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l), so the magnitude squared is h² +k² +l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ.

Wait, but earlier I tried that and the denominator became negative. So maybe the correct formula is:

d = 1/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )) )

But then, for (111): denominator is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 - 3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196≈-2.196, which is negative. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( ... ), which would require the denominator to be positive.

Wait, another formula I found online says that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but with this, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 3*sqrt(3) *3 )=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*(1.732))=10/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang.

But the options are much larger. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is inverted. Maybe the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) / (a^2) + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the distance between lattice planes, not the interatomic distance. But the question specifically says interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

But that gives a small d. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

But that gives a negative denominator, which is impossible.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for an example. Let's say in a cubic system with a=10, (111) plane: d = 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms. But our options are much higher, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't 'a', but something else. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance isn't 'a' necessarily. For example, in a face-centered cubic (which is a cubic system), the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2, which is shorter than 'a'.

Wait, but in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So perhaps 'a' is not 10. Maybe 'a' is the edge length, and the nearest neighbor distance is something else. Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance refers to the nearest neighbor distance, not the unit cell parameter.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2. In a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance would be the distance between two adjacent atoms, which could be along the edges of the rhombohedron.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedron. So the distance along the edges is 'a', but perhaps the nearest neighbor is not along the edge but along a diagonal.

Wait, the rhombohedral structure can be viewed as a cube with each face compressed. The nearest neighbor might be along the face diagonal or something else.

Hmm, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance 'd_nn' is a function of 'a' and the angles. Let's think about the structure.

In a simple cubic structure, d_nn = a. In a rhombohedral structure, each atom has six nearest neighbors (like in a cubic close-packed structure?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is the same as 'a', because the atoms are at the vertices. So if 'a' is 10, then the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstroms.

Then, the interplanar distance is for the (111) planes, which would be different.

But according to the formula I tried earlier, the interplanar distance would be about 3.49 Angstroms, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of another way. The interplanar distance can be found using the plane's normal vector and the unit cell parameters.

The formula for d_{hkl} in terms of the unit cell parameters a, angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier. So for (111), with α=β=γ=30°,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) ≈10/2.863≈3.49 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ) )

But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula used in X-ray diffraction, which uses the interplanar distance.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance d in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

But when I plug in the numbers, it's a negative denominator. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of this. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the volume.

Wait, if V is the unit cell volume, which I calculated earlier as approximately 221 Ang^3, then the reciprocal is 1/221 ≈0.00452.

But I don't see how that ties into the formula.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the (hkl) vector in reciprocal space multiplied by 2π.

So, the reciprocal space vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l) scaled by 2π, but adjusted for the unit cell.

Wait, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is |G|=sqrt( (h a/(2π))^2 + (k b/(2π))^2 + (l c/(2π))^2 - 2 hk (ab cos γ)/( (2π)^2 ) - ... )

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c =a0, and α=β=γ=θ.

So |G|= (2π/d) sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, then rearranged, d= (2π) / |G|.

Wait, but I'm getting tangled here. Let me think of the formula for d in terms of G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ ) ) * (1/ a )

But then d would be 1/(sqrt(...)/a ), which would make d = a / sqrt(...), which brings us back to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ )

Which for (111), gives 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈8.196, so d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the sign of the angles. Wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-θ) instead of cosθ.

Because in some conventions, angles in crystals are measured from 90 degrees. So cos(180-30)= -cos30=-0.866.

So plugging in cosθ = -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator becomes 3 + 2*(1)(1)*(-0.866)*3 =3 + 2*(-0.866)*3 =3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors, which might be 180-30=150 degrees.

Wait, in crystallography, the angles in the metric tensor are often taken as the angles between the lattice vectors, so if the interatomic angle is 30°, the angle in the metric tensor would be 180-30=150°, whose cosine is -sqrt(3)/2.

So maybe the formula should use cos(150°)= -sqrt(3)/2.

Let me try that.

So, for (111), the denominator becomes:

3 + 2*(1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) ) *3.

Wait, no, the formula would be:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2 hk cosα + 2 hl cosβ + 2 kl cosγ )

But if α=β=γ=150°, then cos(150)=-sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(1)(1)*(-sqrt(3)/2 )*3.

Which is 3 + 3*(-sqrt(3)).

That's 3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is really confusing. I'm stuck and can't find the right approach. Maybe I should look for an alternative method.

Another approach: Let's find the reciprocal of the plane in reciprocal space.

The plane (111) in reciprocal space has a normal vector (1,1,1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*cosθ + 2*cosθ + 2*cosθ ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in reciprocal space, the vectors are orthogonal, so the magnitude would be sqrt( (h)^2 + (k)^2 + (l)^2 + 2hk cos(180-θ) + ... ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the (111) plane's reciprocal vector.

The reciprocal vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l) multiplied by (2π/d).

So the length of the reciprocal vector is sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ ) ) * (2π/d).

But I don't know d, so this approach might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume of the unit cell and use it to find d.

Wait, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

Earlier, I calculated V ≈221 Ang^3.

But I don't see a direct way to find d from V.

Wait, the volume is also related to the interplanar distances. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is the same as the edge length a, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. For a (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure, the interplanar distance is the distance between two consecutive planes along the direction perpendicular to (111).

But how to compute that?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this using vectors.

The plane (111) has a normal vector n = a1 + a2 + a3, where a1, a2, a3 are the lattice vectors.

The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the vector n divided by the magnitude of (hkl) in reciprocal space.

But without knowing the exact form of the lattice vectors, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the dot product of n with the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Reciprocal vectors b1, b2, b3 satisfy: a_i · b_j = δ_ij.

The reciprocal vectors can be computed as:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / (a1·a2×a3)
b2 = (a3 × a1) / (a1·a2×a3)
b3 = (a1 × a2) / (a1·a2×a3)

But this requires knowing the cross products and the scalar triple product.

Let me compute the scalar triple product V = a1·(a2 × a3). Since the unit cell is rhombohedral, a1, a2, a3 have the same length, a, and angles between them are 30°.

So, a2 × a3 = |a2 a3 sinθ| * n, where n is the unit vector perpendicular to a2 and a3.

The magnitude |a2 × a3|= a^2 sinθ.

The scalar triple product V = a1·(a2 × a3) = a1 · (a^2 sinθ n).

The dot product a1 ·n is cos(180-θ') if θ' is the angle between a1 and (a2 ×a3). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the formula for the scalar triple product in terms of the unit cell volume.

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

Which we calculated earlier as approximately 221 Ang^3.

So, the reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

The (hkl) plane's reciprocal vector is h b1 + k b2 + l b3.

But perhaps for the (111) plane, the reciprocal vector is b1 + b2 + b3.

The magnitude of this vector is |b1 + b2 + b3|.

The interplanar distance d is 2π divided by this magnitude.

So, |b1 + b2 + b3| = 2π/d.

But calculating this magnitude is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector:

|b1 + b2 + b3|^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2hk (b1·b2) + 2hl (b1·b3) + 2kl (b2·b3)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the dot products between the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, in reciprocal space, the dot product bi · bj is 2π/(a V) times something.

Hmm, this is getting too involved, and I'm running out of time. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

I found a formula online that says:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ ) ) * (1/a )

Wait, but that would make d= a / sqrt(...), which is what I tried earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of the volume.

Wait, another formula I found:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ )

But again, same result as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

Given a=10, angles 30°, (111).

Denominator inside sqrt is:

3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196≈8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang.

But none of the options are near 3.5. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

But that would give denominator as 3 - 3*sqrt(3)≈-2.196, which is impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to calculate the interplanar distance using the volume.

Wait, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²θ + 2 cos³θ ) ≈221 Ang^3.

The (111) plane's spacing can also be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ )

Which gives d=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang.

But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given isn't 'a' but something else. For instance, the interatomic distance could be along the (111) direction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ ) / (something).

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. The options are:

A) 9.08
B)8.95
C)9.54
D)10.05

These are all close to 10. So perhaps the correct formula for d is a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cosθ + ... ) / something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (something).

Wait, but for (111), h² +k² +l²=3, so sqrt(3)=1.732. So 10 * 1.732=17.32, which is way higher than options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the denominator, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator without 'a', but that would give a much larger value.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a / [ sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) * sqrt(1 - cosθ) ]

But for h=k=l=1, it's 3, and cosθ=0.866, so 1 -0.866=0.134. So sqrt(3 * 0.134)=sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

Then d=10 /0.634≈15.77, which is way too high.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance because the planes are spaced such that each plane contains an atom, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is (A) 9.08.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 8.95.

Wait, let me think of the formula again. If the denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3))=sqrt(8.196)=2.863, then d=10/2.863≈3.49. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Which for (111) is 10 * sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) )=10*sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863=28.63. Which is way larger than options.

No.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong and the correct denominator is sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ )

But that gives negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So denominator is sqrt( |3 -3*sqrt(3)| )=sqrt(2.196)=1.48.

Then d=10/1.48≈6.757, still not matching options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps I should compute the inverse of 10 * something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 9.54.

Wait, perhaps using h² +k² +l²=3, and using cosθ=0.866.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Which gives 10/sqrt(3+3*sqrt(3))≈3.49. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

Which gives negative, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

In this case, with alpha=beta=gamma=30°, each term is 2*1*1*0.866.

So 3 - 6 * 0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. The square root is imaginary, so that's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the angles are 150°, so cos150=-0.866. Then denominator becomes 3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Still negative.

I think I'm going around in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are all close to 10, so perhaps the correct formula gives d≈9.54, which is option C.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma}}
\]

Here:
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (interatomic distance),
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \),
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) for the (111) plane.

### Step 1: Substitute values into the formula
The denominator inside the square root becomes:
\[
3 - 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ) \cdot 3
\]
Since \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 - 6 \cdot 0.866 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the result
The denominator becomes the square root of a negative number (\( \sqrt{-2.196} \)), which is not physically meaningful. This suggests that the formula may not be directly applicable or that additional considerations are needed.

### Step 3: Reassess the formula
The formula may involve the absolute value of the denominator or a different interpretation of the angles. However, the exact derivation remains unclear. Given the options provided, the interplanar distance is expected to be close to \( 10 \, \text{Å} \), as the options (A, B, C, D) are all near this value.

### Step 4: Make an educated guess
Since the options are close to \( 10 \, \text{Å} \), and no further clarity is gained from the calculations, the most reasonable choice is **C) 9.54 Å**, as it aligns with the expected range.
