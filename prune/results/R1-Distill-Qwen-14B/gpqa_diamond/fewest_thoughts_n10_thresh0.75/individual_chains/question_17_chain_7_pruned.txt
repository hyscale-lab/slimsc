Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable.

So, the problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? And when it dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

The reaction should be something like [CaEDTA]^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given, which is for the formation of the complex. Oh wait, K for the complex formation is the reverse of the dissociation. So K_form = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But in this problem, they give K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10, which is the formation constant. So when the complex dissociates, the reverse reaction would have K = 1/K_form.

Wait,
