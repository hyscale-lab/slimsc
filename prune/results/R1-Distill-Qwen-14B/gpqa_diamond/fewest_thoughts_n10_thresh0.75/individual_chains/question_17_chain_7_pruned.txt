Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember from my notes that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for the Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. They also mention the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form the complex.

Wait, what's the reaction here? I think EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) typically binds with metal ions like Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio. The formation of the complex would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, and assuming that the solution is ideal with no activity coefficients to worry about, the concentration of Ca²+ should be equal to the concentration of EDTA^4-.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the dissociation. If we have the complex CaEDTA, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant
