Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so the Bubble Chamber is a detector used in particle physics. When a particle decays, the chamber can record the tracks of the decay products. But for this, the detector's resolution must be good enough to distinguish the decay vertex accurately. If the resolution is too poor, the decay tracks might appear too close together, making it hard to tell if the decay happened at a specific point.

So the question is about the minimum resolution required to detect at least 30% of the decays. Resolution in this context probably refers to the detector's ability to measure the position of the decay. So, I think it's about the time it takes for the decay to happen and how that translates into a spatial resolution.

Wait, but wait. The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. However, when the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The gamma factor (γ) comes into play here. Gamma is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. So, γ = E / m. 

Given that E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, let's calculate γ. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9178. So about 7.918 times the proper lifetime.

So the lab frame lifetime τ is τ₀ multiplied by γ. So τ = τ₀ * γ = 8e-16 s * 7.9178 ≈ 6.334e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution? Well, the lifetime determines how far the particle travels before decaying, right? The length is velocity times time. But to get the velocity, I think we can approximate it for high-energy particles. Since the energy is much higher than the rest mass, the velocity is approximately the speed of light. So v ≈ c.

So the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ ≈ c * τ. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L ≈ 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 meters, which is 1.9002 micrometers. Wait, that's 1.9002e-6 m.

But wait, what's the significance of this length? Oh, I think that's the average decay length. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps this is related to the uncertainty in measuring the decay position.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the probability of a decay being observed depends on the detector's acceptance. But in this case, I think it's more about the minimum distance the decay products must be separated for the detector to distinguish them.

Alternatively, the concept of the proper decay length and the minimum distance needed for the tracks to be resolved. So perhaps the minimum resolution Δ is such that the fraction of decays where the decay length L is greater than Δ is 30%. Or wait, maybe it's about the fraction of the decays that have a decay length that allows the detector to resolve them.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing concepts. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is τ₀. The lifetime in the lab frame is longer because of the particle's speed. The average decay length is L = γβcτ₀. Since β is v/c, and for high energy particles, β is approximately 1.

So in this case, L would be roughly γ c τ₀, which is what I calculated earlier, about 1.9e-6 meters.

But the question is about the detector's resolution. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish between two points. So if the decay length is smaller than the detector's resolution, the two decay products' tracks would appear to come from the same point, making it hard to distinguish the decay. But if the decay length is larger than the resolution, the tracks would be separated, making the decay observable.

Wait, but how does this relate to observing at least 30%? Oh, perhaps we're looking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays have a decay length larger than the resolution. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that the particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay law: P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L). So the probability that the decay occurs beyond a certain x is given by this.

But if the detector's resolution is Δ, then perhaps it can only observe the decay if the decay length L is greater than some multiple of Δ. Let me think. Alternatively, the detector can resolve the decay if the two decay products' paths are separated by at least Δ. So the probability that the decay length is greater than Δ determines the fraction observed.

Wait, but the problem says the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, we need at least 30% of the
