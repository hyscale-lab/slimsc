Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation, and I'm supposed to figure out which statement is true about its validity. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, especially in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Let me think through this.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). I think ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. From what I recall, the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is limited by the space charge—that is, the electric field is so strong that the charge carriers are decelerated by the space charge they themselves create. So this happens in regions where the external voltage isn't so high that other effects like ohmic behavior take over.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which the equation is valid. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, Ohmic contact implies that the contact doesn't have any barriers, so it's easy for carriers to inject. Also, negligible drift current—but wait, in the SCLC regime, I thought drift currents are important because the carriers are moving under an electric field. If drift current is negligible, that would imply more of a diffusion-limited situation, right? So maybe this isn't correct.

Option B: trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean Ohmic contacts, same as A. So if there's no injection barrier, then the device is Ohmic. The equation assumes negligible diffusion current, which would make sense because in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, then drift is the main thing, which fits the SCLC model. So B might be correct.

Option C: single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contacts are barrier contacts, so that introduces a barrier. Wait, if the device has a Schottky contact, then there is a barrier. But the Mott-Gurney equation is for when the voltage is such that the space charge is dominant. If there's a
