Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about nucleons emitting a particle and the allowed partial waves. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin (T), angular momentum (L), and spin (S) of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 modulo 2. Wait, I think that's a parity condition or something related to the symmetry of the wavefunction.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So we need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are A, B, C, D, each involving different transitions.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. From what I remember, the notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S in the notation, which is 0 for S states. So J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The particle X emitted has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is a product of orbital and spin parts. The initial state's parity is intrinsic parity of the NN system. But wait, the problem is about the transition when X is emitted. So the parity of the process must be conserved, considering both the initial and final states.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. How does parity work here? The parity of the NN system (assuming they're in a state with orbital angular momentum L) is (-1)^L. Because the parity of a single nucleon is positive (I think), so for two particles, it's (−1)^L, because their spin doesn't affect the parity. Or wait, maybe it's more complicated. Wait, the parity of a two-body system is indeed given by (−1)^L, because spin doesn't contribute to parity. So the initial state has L=0, so parity is 1.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN system with some new quantum numbers, and the emitted particle X. The parity of the entire process (initial state) must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative: parity(initial) = parity(final_NN) * parity(X) * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. Wait, but I'm not sure about that last part. Alternatively, maybe in the decay process, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle contributes to the parity.

Wait, the initial parity is 1. The final parity would be the parity of the NN state times the parity of X and times (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. So, initial parity = parity(NN_final) * parity(X) * (-1)^l.

So, 1 = parity(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l.

What's the parity of the NN system in the final state? It's (-1)^L_final, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission.

So, parity(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final. Let's plug that in.

1 = [ (-1)^L_final ) * (-1) * (-1)^l ].

Simplify: 1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L_final + l}.

Which is 1 = (-1)^{L_final + l + 1}.

So, (-1)^{L_final + l +1} = 1.

Which implies that L_final + l +1 must be even. So L_final + l must be odd.

So L_final + l = odd.

That's one condition.

Now, what about the Pauli statistics condition? T(NN) = S(NN)
