Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let me go through the information given step by step.

The researcher is working with a transgenic mouse model where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They're using a plasmid that's been genetically engineered and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. After that, they're selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies and testing the expression.

The issue is that they can't overexpress the protein as expected. So, they're looking into why this is happening. The problem must be in the construct they're using, since the cells are transfected with this plasmid.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand, so the coding (sense) strand. Let me try to analyze this. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine), so that's good. 

Wait, I also notice that the sequence includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The HA tag is usually a small peptide (like from influenza HA) added to a protein to help with purification. It's typically placed at the N-terminus. So the construct should be producing a fusion protein with HA at the beginning followed by GADD45G.

But the overexpression isn't happening. Let's think about possible issues with the sequence.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If the HA tag's sequence is wrong, the antibody used for affinity purification might not recognize it. But that would affect purification, not necessarily the expression of the protein. Since the question says the researcher is unable to overexpress the protein, maybe the issue is more about the construct not being expressed, not the purification.

Option B: The ribosome is terminating early. That would mean there's a stop codon upstream in the sequence. Ribosomes read from the start codon until they hit a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA). So if there's an in-frame stop codon before the end of the GADD45G coding sequence, the protein would be truncated, maybe leading to no functional protein. But would that prevent overexpression? Possibly, but in that case, some truncated protein might be present. Also, let me look for any stop codons in the sequence.

Looking through the sequence: Let's scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Wait, the sequence is given as the coding (plus) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this. Let's think: The coding sequence is written as DNA, so the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand (since DNA is double-stranded, but mRNA is synthesized from the template, which is the complementary strand). Wait, no. Wait, the plus strand is the same as the mRNA, but in RNA, T is replaced by U.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The DNA is double-stranded: plus (sense) strand and minus (antisense) strand. The coding strand is the one that's the same as mRNA, except T becomes U. So the plus strand sequence provided is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same sequence with Tâ†’U.

So, looking for stop codons in the mRNA: any UAA, UAG
