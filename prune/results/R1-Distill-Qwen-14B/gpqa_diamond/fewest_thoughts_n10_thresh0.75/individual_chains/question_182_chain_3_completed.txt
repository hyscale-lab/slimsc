Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current in semiconductor devices, particularly in the space-charge-limited current regime. I think it's used when the current is limited by the electric field created by the space charge itself, rather than other factors like carrier generation or recombination.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). From what I recall, J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is the length of the device. 

Now, the question is about the validity conditions of this equation. So I need to think about the assumptions made when deriving the Mott-Gurney equation.

I remember that the derivation assumes that the device is in the SCLC (space-charge-limited current) regime. In this regime, the dominant factor is the space charge creating a region where the electric field is such that it limits the current. 

What are the conditions for this? Well, the device should be single-carrier, meaning only electrons or only holes are moving. Because if both carriers are involved, the equation might change. Also, the contacts should be Ohmic, or at least not have any significant barrier for the carriers. Ohmic contacts allow carriers to pass without much voltage drop, which I think is important because in that case, the entire voltage is applied across the bulk of the device, not consumed by the contacts.

Another important condition is that the trap levels are negligible. Traps would cause carriers to get stuck, leading to different current behavior, so the equation assumes a trap-free environment.

Wait, what about the injection? Oh, right, in the SCLC region, it's usually assumed that the injection is complete, but wait, isn't that for the Fowler-Nordheim regime when you have field emission? Or wait, no. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the voltage is such that the injection is ohmic, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. Ohmic injection implies that the voltage barriers are negligible. So the Mott-Gurney equation applies when you have an Ohmic contact, so that all the applied voltage is across the semiconductor, leading to a uniform electric field. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think about the derivation. The Mott-Gurney equation comes from solving Poisson's equation in the space-charge-limited scenario. The derivation assumes that the current is due to the electric field created by the space charge itself. So, the key assumptions are that it's a single-carrier device, trap-free, Ohmic contacts (so no voltage drop at the contacts), and that the current is limited by the space charge, hence the name.

So looking at the options:

Option A says: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, but drift current is the main component in this regime. If drift current is negligible, then that can't be right. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. Wait, no carrier injection barrier would imply Ohmic contacts, right? Because injection barriers like Schottky contacts create a barrier, leading to incomplete injection. So if there's no injection barrier, that's Ohmic. And negligible diffusion current. Wait, in Mott-Gurney, the current is due to drift, so diffusion is not the main factor. So if diffusion is negligible, that's acceptable. So B could be correct.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contacts have barriers, which would mean partial injection. But wait, the Mott-Gurney assumes Ohmic conditions because otherwise, the voltage isn't fully applied across the device. So if it's a Schottky contact, the voltage drop would be across the contact, thus the field in the semiconductor would be lower. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: two-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. No, because Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier devices. Two carriers would complicate things, as the space charge would involve both electrons and holes, which is not the case in the standard equation.

So back to the options, option B seems to fit. Trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current.

Wait, but what about drift vs. diffusion? In the Mott-Gurney derivation, drift is the main carrier. So the equation assumes that the current is due to drift, so diffusion is negligible. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current density \( J \) in a semiconductor device operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the carrier mobility, \( V \) is the applied voltage, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on specific assumptions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The equation is derived for single-carrier transport, meaning only electrons or holes contribute to the current.
2. **Trap-free environment**: The presence of traps (defects or impurities) would alter the current behavior, so the device must be trap-free.
3. **Ohmic contacts**: The contacts should have negligible voltage drop, ensuring that the applied voltage is fully distributed across the semiconductor bulk.
4. **Negligible diffusion current**: The dominant current mechanism in the SCLC regime is drift current, so diffusion current must be negligible.
5. **No carrier injection barrier**: This ensures that all carriers are injected into the device, which is consistent with Ohmic contacts.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: States "negligible drift current," which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current is the dominant mechanism. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Matches the assumptions of a trap-free, single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This is correct.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a voltage drop and partial carrier injection, violating the assumption of Ohmic contacts. This is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is inconsistent with the Mott-Gurney equation, as it applies to single-carrier transport. This is incorrect.

Thus, the correct statement is **Option B**, as it satisfies all the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.
