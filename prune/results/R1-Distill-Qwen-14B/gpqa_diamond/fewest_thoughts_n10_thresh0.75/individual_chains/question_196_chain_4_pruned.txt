Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess the speed can't be ignored compared to the speed of light.

The problem states that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The speed of light is c, which probably comes into play because we're dealing with relativistic effects. 

So, the options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is achieved at the equilibrium point (x=0), and it's given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But since this is a relativistic scenario, I think we have to use the relativistic equations of motion or perhaps consider the energy. 

Wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The correct expression for kinetic energy in special relativity is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the energy approach is the way to go here.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. The potential energy in Hooke's law is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, I'm not sure if the potential energy is treated the same. Alternatively, maybe we can think of the total mechanical energy as remaining constant, just like in the non-relativistic case.

So, the total mechanical energy E would be the maximum potential energy when x = A. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, does the potential energy change? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps we'll proceed with the same form for simplicity. 

So, E_max_potential = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic, so E = (γ - 1)mc². Setting these equal: (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA². 

Let's write that equation:

(γ - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

Solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some value, say, let's call it α. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + α).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + α)^2).

Now, substituting back α = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ).

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ), which matches what I just got. So that's looking promising.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. So, α is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So 1 + α is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So the denominator in the fraction inside the sqrt is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Yes, that matches Option D.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the other options. Option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be correct if we weren't considering relativity. But since the question is relativistic, C is probably not the right choice.

Option A has a different structure. The denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m)), squared. But in our expression, the denominator involves (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)). So A doesn't look right.

Option B has 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) in the sqrt, but it's under a square root and added to 1. Hmm, not matching.

So the correct expression seems to be Option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, which remains constant. 

At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the energy is entirely potential:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]  
At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, given by the relativistic expression for kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]  

Equating the two expressions for total energy:  
\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]  
Solving for \( \gamma \):  
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA
