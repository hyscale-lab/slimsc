Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The initial setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I need to break this down. Let's start by understanding what happens when you dilute the acetic acid. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, diluting it will shift the dissociation equilibrium, but the pH won't just be that of pure water because the acid will still donate some H+ ions.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should find out the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, you can calculate the new concentration based on dilution.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same because we're only adding water, which doesn't react with it.

Calculating moles: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So, moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration will be moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So it's a 1:1 molar ratio.

Next, I think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate how much NaOH is needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from before). The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for the 25% part, that's 25% of the equivalence volume, right? So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Let's find out how much that is in moles. Moles NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will react with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So, the initial moles in the diluted solution are 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The
