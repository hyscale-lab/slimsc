Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and think about how to approach it. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, okay, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me plan this out. I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Then, figure out the moles of acetic acid and how much is neutralized at 25% titration. For the equivalence point, I probably need to consider the salt formed, which would be sodium acetate, and calculate its pH based on hydrolysis.

So, step by step. First, the initial dilution. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add another 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. The number of moles of acetic acid initially is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration will be moles divided by total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait—no, wait. Wait! Wait a second. Wait, 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Then, when you dilute to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah that's right.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, but wait. The amount of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. Alternatively, 25% of the moles needed to neutralize all the acetic acid. So maybe I should find the equivalence point volume first.

The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

So 25% of that volume is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, that means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid are neutralized, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

So the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. But after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

The moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate ions: 0.00025 moles.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given as -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So the first value would be around 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the dilution correctly. Wait, the initial solution after adding 20 cm³ water is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³.

So, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are as I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact concentrations without approximating, but I think that's okay.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the buffer equation, but maybe I should account for the dilution correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the dilution affects
