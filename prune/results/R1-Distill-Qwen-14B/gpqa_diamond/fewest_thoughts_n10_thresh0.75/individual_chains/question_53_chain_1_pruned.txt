Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group. Oh right, esters have carbonyl groups, so the IR peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ would indicate that.

Then looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic H signals. So maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents' positions determine the number of unique H environments. For example, if it's para-substituted, there would be two sets. Wait, no, para would actually have a single set of aromatic protons if the substituents are symmetrical. Wait, wait, but it's di-substituted, so maybe it's ortho, meta, or para. Let me think.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two, so perhaps the substituents are in such positions that they cause two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, but the substituents are such that the ring has two equivalent Hs. Or maybe it's ortho substitution, which might lead to more complexity, but perhaps in this case, two signals.

Then there are two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in alkenes. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighbor, maybe a trans configuration. The doublet of quartets is more complex—could be coupling with two different sets of protons, like adjacent to a CH₂ group or something else. Hmm.

And two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH₂ signals. So each –CH3 is in a different environment, maybe. Or perhaps they're equivalent but split into two due to coupling.

Putting it all together, the molecule likely has an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester. Wait, the ester group is an R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the structure could be something like an aryl ester, maybe with another substituent.

Wait, another thought: the di-substitution could be with an ester group and another group. Let's think about the NMR signals. The vinyl Hs suggest there's an alkene somewhere. Maybe a substituent like CH₂CH₂ something, but not sure.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula will help. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, etc. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0.

Let's take option D: C11H12O2. So DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. Which would be: a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an ester (which has a double bond in the carbonyl, so 1 DoU), maybe a double bond elsewhere (like an alkene) and possibly another ring or something else.

Alternatively, option C: C12H12O2. DoU = (2*12+2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7. That's 7 DoU: benzene (3), ester (1), and perhaps a ring or two double bonds.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl protons, so an alkene is present. So DoU will include that.

So, the structure probably has an aromatic ring, an ester group (which is a carbonyl), and an alkene (another double bond). So for the aromatic ring (6-membered), that's 3 DoU. Ester is another (the carbonyl), and the alkene another. So total 5. Then, perhaps another double bond or a ring, but maybe not.

Wait, but the options differ in H and C counts. Let's think about the structure.

The aromatic ring is substituted with an ester group and another group that has a double bond and methyl groups. So, maybe the substituents on the benzene are an ester (like COO-R) and another group with a double bond, such as a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR has two CH3 groups. Maybe the ester is an aryl ester, like O-CO-O-Ar, but then where are the CH3's? Alternatively, maybe the ester is an alkyl ester attached to the ring, and another substituent which is a vinyl group or something with CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetylenic group, but I don't think that's the case because the NMR shows vinyl Hs, suggesting an alkene.

Let me think about possible structures. Let's imagine the benzene ring is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) with an ester group and another group. Alternatively, para.

Wait, the problem says di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, and the other is a vinyl group, or perhaps a group with a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl Hs. So perhaps there's a substituent with a CH₂CH₂ group attached to the ring, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, maybe a substituent with a double bond, like CH₂=CH- something.

Wait, the two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So maybe the vinyl group is part of a substituent like -CH₂-CH₂-O-CO-..., but not sure. Or perhaps a substituent like -CH₂-CH₂- with the vinyl Hs as part of an alkene.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substituent like CH₂CH3, but that would give more signals
