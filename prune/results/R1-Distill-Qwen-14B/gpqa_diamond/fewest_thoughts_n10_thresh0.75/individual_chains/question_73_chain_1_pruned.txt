Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I remember that in relativity, when dealing with speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the effects of special relativity, like length contraction and time dilation. So I can't just do 0.6c minus 0.5c because that's only valid in classical mechanics, not when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, right! The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2) ). So I need to plug in v1 and v2 into this. Oh wait, but wait—wait, which one is v1 and which is v2 here? The problem says the first astronaut is 2m moving at 0.6c, and the second is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So if I'm considering the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, or the other way around, the formula will give the same result because it's just the difference. Or wait, actually, no, because when you change the frame, the relative speed formula still holds, so maybe I can just use either. Let me make sure.

So, let's pick astronaut A (2m) moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B (3m) moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or vice versa. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So plug into the formula:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Wait, let's compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel =
