Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

First, let's read the problem again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So we're dealing with special relativity here because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light.

The question has two parts: finding the relative speed between them and calculating the total energy of the system. The options give possible combinations of these two values.

Starting with the relative speed. I remember that when objects are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²))

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed from the perspective of one astronaut would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because the velocity of one as observed from the other's frame is given by this formula.

So let's plug in the numbers. The first astronaut (A) is moving at v1 = 0.6c, and the second (B) at v2 = 0.5c.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that.

(0.6 *0.5) = 0.3. So 0.3c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Next, the total energy. Since each astronaut is moving, their relativistic energies contribute to the system's total energy. The total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy for each is given by E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, v=0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, v=0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 3 * 1.1547 is around 3.464 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc².

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for energy.

Gamma for A:
v=0.6c, so v²/c²=0.36. 1 - 0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. Gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Yes.

E_A = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Gamma for B:
v=0.5c, v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660≈1.1547.

E_B = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈3 * 1.1547=3.4641 mc².

Adding 2.5 and 3.4641: 5.9641 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: same speed but E=5 mc².

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but what about the relative speed calculation? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) 

Which simplifies to (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) => 0.1c/(0.7) = 0.142857 c, approximately 0.14c. Correct.

So the speed is about 0.14c and energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, that's option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
