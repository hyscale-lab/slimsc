Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, that looks familiar. Oh right! I think that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Maximally mixed states are the ones where the qubit is in a completely uncertain state, like being in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities. 

So how does this relate to the geometrical position in qubit space? I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside a unit sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and each Pauli matrix is associated with one component. The density matrix can be written in terms of these Pauli matrices. 

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find the components of r.

Let's expand the given ρ. ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, because |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. Let me compute each term. 

|0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Now, the identity matrix can be written as I = σ_0, where σ_0 is the 2x2 identity matrix. So substituting back into the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. But here, ρ is I/2. So setting them equal: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/
