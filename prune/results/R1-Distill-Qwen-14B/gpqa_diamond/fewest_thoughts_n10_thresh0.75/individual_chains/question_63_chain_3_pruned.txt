Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Right, in the quantum mechanical model, diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that involves either a vibrational or rotational change, but maybe both? Or perhaps it's a combination.

Wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotation and vibration. The energy levels are given by some formula. I think the energy levels are something like E = [ (v + 1/2) hbar w_vib + (J(J+1) hbar^2 )/( 2 I ) ] where v is the vibrational quantum number and J is the rotational.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. So v=0 and J=0, I guess. Because the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state. So the initial state is v=0, J=0.

When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next higher energy state. The next lowest would be either increasing v or J. But which is lower in energy, an increase in v or J?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing h w_vib, and the rotational energy levels have spacing proportional to J(J+1). For diatomic molecules, the rotational energy is usually much smaller than the vibrational energy, especially for low J. So, the vibrational transition would require higher energy than rotational. But wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. So the next possible state would probably involve a transition in either vibration or rotation.

Wait, but
