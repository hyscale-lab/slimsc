Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. We have an unknown compound, and we're given data from three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Our job is to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided.

The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

First, I'll break down each piece of data and see what they tell us about the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an amine, but I don't think that's an option here. Let me think: if it's a carbonyl group, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 might be C=O. The 1700 is more like a ketone or aldehyde, while 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or something else). Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but again, not sure if that's in our options.

Wait, the problem says there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone with another functional group. Oh, wait another thought: maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and the 1650 is conjugated, like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, such as in an aromatic ester. Or perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated double bond or an amide. Alternatively, the 1700 could be an ester (which typically absorb around 1740, but maybe in some cases lower) or a ketone.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The two strong peaks: 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, definitely. 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Since it's a lower wavenumber, it's probably conjugated. So, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups or a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, the 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be conjugated, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch, which is usually around 1600-1680. So, vinyl groups would have that. But wait, the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so we have double bonds.

Wait, in the NMR, the presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a double bond. So maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch. But wait, the FTIR is for functional groups, so the C=C is usually in the range of 1620-1680 cm⁻¹, which fits 1650. So perhaps that's a conjugated double bond, maybe in an aromatic ring (like in a benzene ring) or an isolated double bond.

But then the 1700 is likely a carbonyl group. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a C=C.

Now, moving to the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So the compound has at least one double bond. So perhaps an alkene or aromatic ring.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. The molecular ion might break into smaller ions. For example, 45 could be CH3CO (45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO, which is 12 + 16 + 12 + 1 = 45? Wait, wait: CH3CO is C2H3O, which is 2*(12) +3*(1) + 16=24+3+16=43. No, that's 43, not 45. Hmm. Maybe it's CH3COOH? No, that's 60. Wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+) which is 91, but that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a ketene, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: 45 could correspond to the loss of a larger fragment. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12) + 10 + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114. If in the mass spec, a fragment breaks off, leaving a smaller ion. For instance, if the molecule loses a group with molecular weight 69, the remaining would be 114-69=45. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the molecular ion of a small fragment. Wait, another option: the fragment could be a CH2O group. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO+ ion, but as I thought earlier, that would be 43.

Wait, maybe 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment like CH3COO- which is 59? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to something else. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 (molecular weight: 6*12 +12 +32=72+12+32=116)

B) C6H10O (72+10+16=98)

C) C6H10O2 (72 +10 +32=114)

D) C6H12O (72+12+16=100)

The mass spec shows a fragment at
