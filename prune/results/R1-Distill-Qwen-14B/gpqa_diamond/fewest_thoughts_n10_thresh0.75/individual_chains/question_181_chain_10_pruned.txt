Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core reactions—pp chain, right? So the pp chain has different branches. I remember that the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different steps in the proton-proton cycle that converts hydrogen into helium.

So, the pp-III branch stopping—what does that mean? I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe the ones with higher energies. Oh right, because in the pp-III branch, the reaction involves the fusion of a proton and a helium-3 nucleus. That reaction releases a lot of energy, so the neutrinos produced there are higher energy.

Now, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the flux ratio F1/F2 is what we're looking for.

Wait, if the pp-III branch stops, that means that a significant source of high-energy neutrinos is gone. But what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remained as they were. So, the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, right?

So normally, the solar neutrino flux has different components. Most of the neutrinos come from the pp-III
