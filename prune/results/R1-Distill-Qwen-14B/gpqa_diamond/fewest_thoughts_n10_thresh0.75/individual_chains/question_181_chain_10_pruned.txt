Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the scenario is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still happening as usual. Now, I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the question is asking for flux(band1)/flux(band2).

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of the Sun's energy. Then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the chain, involving higher temperatures or densities maybe.

If the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Well, the pp chain produces neutrinos through several steps. I remember that the dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the pp-I branch, which is the main reaction where two protons fuse to deuterium and a positron and a neutrino. Then, some branching occurs, like in the pp-II and pp-III steps.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, that must affect certain neutrino production paths. So, the pp-III branch might be a minor part of the whole process, but its absence could change the distribution of neutrinos.

So, neutrinos from the Sun are produced in different processes. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. I think the pp chain is more dominant in the Sun, producing about 90% of the neutrinos.

Neutrinos have different energies based on the reactions. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around a few hundred keV. The higher-energy neutrinos might come from the later stages of the pp chain or from other processes like the CNO cycle.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, perhaps the main pp-I and pp-II reactions continue. Or does the pp-III branch contribute to the high-energy neutrinos?
