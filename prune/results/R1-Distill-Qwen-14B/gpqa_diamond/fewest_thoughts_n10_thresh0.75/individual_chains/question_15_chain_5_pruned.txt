Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let's break down the problem.

Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So I know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The masses are the same for both. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. That means Planet_1 orbits much closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit, like how Mercury has a shorter period than Venus.

Wait, but the host stars are different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are equal. Interesting. So same size but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I recall is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (m_planet / M_star)), but wait, no, that's for the RV method detection. For transits, the probability is given by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination angle. But since the planets are already detected via RV, we might know their masses but not their inclination. But for transit probability, the chance is higher when the orbit is edge-on, but we don't know that. Oh wait, no, the probability is actually based on the geometric likelihood, which is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, no, the geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet / M_star)))), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source I remember says that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by something, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's roughly R
