Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed. Let me think about what I know.

Alright, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is proportional to x squared, right? And in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found by converting the potential energy into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formulas anymore.

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², because at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. Then, when it passes through the equilibrium, all that becomes kinetic. So the kinetic energy (KE) would be (1/2)m v_max². Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is for the non-relativistic case.

But here, the question is relativistic. So I need to use relativistic mechanics. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the oscillator is 1-dimensional and obeys Hooke's law. So the potential is V(x) = (1/2)k x². But in relativity, the equations change. The energy in relativity isn't the same as in Newtonian physics.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy in terms of total energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But also, the potential energy is part of the system's total energy.

Wait, no, in Newtonian mechanics, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the concept of potential energy in such a system might not be as straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider the total energy as the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, and that the potential energy contributes to the total energy in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is treated as part of the total energy. So, the total energy E is (gamma) m c², which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)k A². So the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy plus the potential energy? Or does the potential energy contribute to the total energy in a different way?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the system's total energy as the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is similar, but when the particle is at maximum displacement, all its energy is in potential form, but in relativity, the total energy might involve gamma.

Wait, no, maybe the total energy at any point is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, which depends on the velocity. But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is just the rest energy? That can't be right because then the system wouldn't have any potential energy. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should consider the energy of the oscillator in terms of relativistic equations. Let me think about the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

In Newtonian mechanics, F = -kx, and F = ma. But relativistically, F is the time derivative of momentum, which is gamma m a. Wait, no, the correct expression is F = d(momentum)/dt, and relativistic momentum is gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v).

But hook's law is F = -k x, so the equation of motion becomes d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps for small amplitudes, it reduces to the Newtonian case. But since the problem gives a maximum amplitude A, which might not be small, so we can't assume that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use energy conservation. The total energy E is conserved. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is the rest energy plus the potential energy. Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy might not just be (1/2)k A². Hmm, that's a point I'm not sure about.

Wait, let's think about the total energy in a relativistic system. The total energy E includes the rest mass energy mc² and the kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, that's not right because in relativity, the potential energy isn't just added like that. Or is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is part of the system's total energy, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = gamma m c², since E is the total energy. So setting these equal:

gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Hmm, that makes sense. So gamma is (1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))).

So let's write that equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, because (1/2)k A² is the potential energy at max displacement, right? So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². And at x=0, E = gamma m c².

So the equation is:

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, let me compute that term.

Let me denote term = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + term.

Then, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - (v²/c²)) = (1 + term)^2.

Hmm, let me compute the left side:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ (1 + term)^2 ].

So,

(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 / (1 + term)^2.

Wait, no, let me rearrange. Let me write:

1/(1 - (v²/c²)) = (1 + term)^2.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/( (1 + term)^2 ).

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + term)^2 ].

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

Which is equal to [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 term + term² - 1 ) / (1 + term)^2 = (2 term + term²)/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ (2 term + term² ) / (1 + term)^2 ].

Hmm, but term is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which for large m or small k, could be small. So maybe term is small, but I don't know if that's the case here.

Wait, but if term is small, we can approximate. Let me see: term = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So if, say, kA² << 2 m c², then term is small. So perhaps we can approximate (1 + term)^2 ≈ 1 + 2 term.

But I'm not sure if that's allowed. Alternatively, perhaps I should keep it as it is and try to express v_max in terms of the options given.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ). Hmm, that seems a bit different.

Wait, let me think again. Let me see what the terms are.

Wait, in the equation I have:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)

gamma = 1 + term.

And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + term)^2.

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 term + term² -1 ) / (1 + term)^2 = (2 term + term²)/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v² = c^2 (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2.

Let me factor term from numerator:

v² = c² term (2 + term) / (1 + term)^2.

But term is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let me substitute:

v² = c² * [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]².

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor the [2 + term] as 2(1 + term/2), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that term might be small, so term << 1. Then, 1/(1 + term) ≈ 1 - term + term² - ..., but I'm not sure if that's valid.

Wait, but if term is small, then term^2 is negligible compared to term. So let's approximate.

So,

v^2/c^2 ≈ [2 term ] / (1 + 2 term ), since term^2 is negligible.

Wait, wait, in the numerator, 2 term + term^2 ≈ 2 term.

Denominator is (1 + term)^2 ≈ 1 + 2 term.

So,

v^2/c^2 ≈ 2 term / (1 + 2 term ) ≈ 2 term [1/(1 + 2 term)].

But if term is small, 1/(1 + 2 term) ≈ 1 - 2 term.

So,

v^2/c^2 ≈ 2 term (1 - 2 term ).

= 2 term - 4 term^2.

But if term is small, term^2 is very small, so perhaps we can ignore it.

So,

v^2/c^2 ≈ 2 term.

Which would make v_max = c sqrt(2 term).

Substituting term,

term = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) ) = c * (A sqrt(k/(m c^2)) )).

Wait, is that correct? Hmm, but in the non-relativistic case, v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m), so this would have a factor of c, which is different. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not make any approximations and proceed algebraically.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of term.

Let me go back to the equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

= [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

= [1 + 2 term + term^2 -1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

= [ 2 term + term^2 ] / (1 + 2 term + term^2 ).

So,

v²/c² = [ 2 term + term^2 ] / [ (1 + term)^2 ].

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 term + term^2 ] / (1 + term)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( 2 term + term^2 ) / (1 + term )

Hmm, that's one way to write it. But I'm not sure how to match this with the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) = 1 - term*2 m c^2/k A^2 ? Wait, term is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1 - term = 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Option B: 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) = 1 + 1/(1 - term )

= [ (1 - term ) + 1 ] / (1 - term )

= (2 - term ) / (1 - term )

So,

sqrt( (2 - term)/(1 - term) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) )

Wait, but the denominator is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ). Wait, but in the denominator, it's 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) in option B.

Wait, but perhaps I should look at the denominator in the square root.

Wait, another approach: the options might have a form that can be matched with our equation.

Let me re-express our expression for v_max.

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2 term + term^2 ) / (1 + term )^2 ].

Let me factor term in numerator:

= c^2 [ term (2 + term ) ] / (1 + term )^2.

But term = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so let me substitute:

= c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ].

Simplify numerator:

= c^2 * [ k A^2/(2 m c^2) * (2 + k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ k A^2/(2 m) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Hmm... complicated.

Wait, maybe I can express this as:

= [ (k A^2)/(2 m) ) * (2 + term ) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Because term is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the denominator of the options.

Looking at the options, option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - term)).

Wait, term = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So 1 - term = 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, 1/(1 - term ) = 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

So, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - term )).

Which is sqrt( (1 - term +1 )/(1 - term ) ) = sqrt( (2 - term )/(1 - term ) )

Wait, but in our case, v^2 is [ (2 term + term^2 ) ] / (1 + term )^2 * c^2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, what if I consider (2 term + term² ) = term (2 + term ). And (1 + term )^2 = 1 + 2 term + term².

So, the fraction is [ term (2 + term ) ] / (1 + 2 term + term^2 )

Well, if term is small, term^2 is negligible, so approx [ 2 term ] / (1 + 2 term )

Which would be approximately 2 term (1 - 2 term ) [using 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x]

= 2 term -4 term^2.

So, v^2 ≈ (2 term ) c^2.

So, v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 term )

= c sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) )

= c * (A sqrt( k/(m c^2) )) )

= A sqrt( k/(m) ) * c/(c) ) ?

Wait, no, let me compute:

sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2) ) = (A sqrt(k/(m c^2)) )

Wait, no, sqrt(k A^2/(m c^2 )) = (A sqrt(k/(m c^2 )) )

Hmm, but in the non-relativistic case, v_max is sqrt( k A^2/m )= A sqrt( k/m ). So in this approximate case, we have v_max ≈ c * (A sqrt( k ) )/( c sqrt( m ) )

= A sqrt( k/(m) ) * (1/c) * c )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, let me compute:

sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) = (A sqrt(k/(m c^2)) ) = (A sqrt(k) )/( c sqrt(m ) )

So, v_max ≈ c * (A sqrt(k) )/( c sqrt(m ) ) ) = A sqrt( k/(m) )

Which is same as the non-relativistic case. Hmm, that's interesting. So when term is small, which would be when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, the maximum speed is the same as the non-relativistic case.

But wait, that can't be, because in relativity, you can't reach the speed of light. So if the non-relativistic case gives a speed lower than c, then for the relativistic case, the speed must be higher but still less than c. Hmm, but according to this approximation, it's the same as non-relativistic.

Alternatively, maybe this suggests that the correct option is C, but that's the non-relativistic case, and the question is about the relativistic case.

But the options A and B have c multiplied by a sqrt expression, whereas option C doesn't have c. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy approach. Let me think again. Another approach.

In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x^2, and the kinetic energy is the rest mass energy plus the relativistic kinetic energy. So, when the oscillator is at x = A, all the energy is potential plus rest energy. At x=0, all the energy is kinetic plus rest energy.

Wait, but actually, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But in the oscillator, the potential energy is part of the system's total energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy at x=A.

At x=0, the potential energy is zero (assuming V(0)=0), so the total energy is rest energy plus kinetic energy.

So,

E_total = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

And,

E_total = gamma mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)k A^2 )/(mc^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + term,

where term = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + term.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + term.

Now, solving for v.

Let me write 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + term )^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + term )^2.

= [ (1 + term )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term )^2.

= (1 + 2 term + term^2 - 1 ) / (1 + term )^2.

= (2 term + term^2 )/(1 + term )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 term + term^2 )/(1 + term )^2.

Hmm, but let's factor the numerator:

2 term + term^2 = term (2 + term )

Denominator: (1 + term )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 term (2 + term )/(1 + term )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2 = c^2 [ 2 term / (1 + term )^2 ) * ( (2 + term )/(2) ) ]

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

v^2 = c^2 [ 2 term (2 + term ) ] / [ 2 (1 + term )^2 ]

Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the denominator in the options.

Looking at option B:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - term ) )

Wait, term here is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - term ) = [ (1 - term ) + 1 ]/(1 - term ) = (2 - term )/(1 - term )

So,

sqrt( (2 - term )/(1 - term ) )

Hmm, our expression is sqrt( (2 term + term^2 )/( 1 + term )^2 )

Wait, not the same.

Option A is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) )

Wait, that's 1 + 1/(1 - [k A^2/(2 m ) ] )

Which would be [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) )

= ( 2 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) ) / ( 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, term is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1/(1 + term )^2.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 = [ (1 + term )^2 -1 ]/(1 + term )^2 = (2 term + term^2)/(1 + term )^2.

Which is exactly what we have for v^2/c².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 term + term^2 )/(1 + term )^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( [2 term + term^2 ] ) / (1 + term )

Which is same as sqrt( (2 term + term^2 )/(1 + term )^2 ) * c.

Wait, but according to option D, it's sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 )

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + term )^2 ]) )

Which is c * sqrt( ( (1 + term )^2 - 1 )/(1 + term )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 term + term^2 )/(1 + term )^2 )

Which matches our expression exactly.

So, option D should be the correct one.

Wait, yes, because:

v_max^2 = c² * [ (2 term + term^2 ) / (1 + term )^2 ]

Which is same as c^2 (1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 )

Which is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic energy formula:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   Setting the two expressions for \( E_{\text{total}} \) equal gives:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Let \( \text{term} = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \text{term}.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \text{term}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \text{term})^2.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \text{term})^2}.
   \]  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \text{term})^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \text{term} = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.

Answer: D
