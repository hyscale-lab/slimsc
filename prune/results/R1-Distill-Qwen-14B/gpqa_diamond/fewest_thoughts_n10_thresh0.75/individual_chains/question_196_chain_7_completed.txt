Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, hook's law is F = -kx, but since it's relativistic, we probably have to consider relativistic effects on the mass or maybe energy. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy (1/2)kA² equals the kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the classical case, and that's option C. But the question is relativistic, so I can't just use that.

In relativity, the energy considerations change because the mass increases with velocity. Oh wait, right! The total energy of the oscillator includes both kinetic and potential, but in relativity, mass increases as gamma m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, but how does that tie into the potential and kinetic energy?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator (which is relativistic) will be the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx². But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. When it's at the equilibrium, all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because in relativity, the potential might not be the same as classical terms. Or perhaps the system's energy is considered as the sum of relativistic kinetic and the classical potential.

Wait, but another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is all potential at maximum displacement, and that equals the kinetic energy when it's at equilibrium. But in the relativistic case, the total energy when it's at maximum displacement would be the sum of rest mass energy plus potential energy? Or maybe the potential energy is part of the total energy.

Wait, no—wait. Let me think again. The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) plus the potential energy (1/2)kA² when the oscillator is at maximum displacement. Because at maximum displacement x=A, all energy is potential, and the kinetic energy is zero. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So at x=0, the kinetic energy equals E - mc². So the kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativistic terms, that's equal to (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting up the equation: (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Solving for gamma. Let me write that:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call that term K for now.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + K

Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+K)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + K)^2

Rearranging:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + K)^2

So, v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + K)^2 )

But K is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so substituting back:

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, the expressions don't quite match. Let me look at the options:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) )

Wait, no, let me check. Let me parse option D correctly.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2))^2 ) )

Wait, no, option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))^2 ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me read it again. Option D says:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) ] )

Wait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Let me write the option as written.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2))²) )

But wait, in our case, K is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so 1 + K = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So the denominator in the 1/(1 + K)^2 is (1 + K)^2. So the expression I have is:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + K)^2 ) ), where K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So substituting K, it becomes:

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))^2) ] )

Wait, no, because (1 + K) squared is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2, not (kA²/(2 m c²)) squared. So the denominator is (1 + ... ) squared, not the square of that term.

Wait, looking at option D again: the denominator is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2, right?

Yes, the option D has (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 inside the denominator.

So according to that, Option D is correct.

Wait, but let's check other options too. Option B is v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ) )

That's a different denominator. So probably not.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

I set the total energy as E = mc² + (1/2)kA², because at maximum displacement, the oscillator's potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero. So E is rest mass plus potential.

Wait, but wait—does the potential energy contribute to the total energy in a relativistic system? Because in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the system's internal energy, which includes potential. So yes, that makes sense.

So when the oscillator reaches x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc².

So, E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A²

So that gives gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me compute 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma)^2 = 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ) )

Which is exactly what option D says.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me re-express the equation 1/(gamma) is sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

Wait, earlier steps:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 )

Which gives,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ]

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ])

Which can be rewritten as,

v = c sqrt( [ ( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 - 1 ) ] / ( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ) )

Simplify numerator: (1 + a)^2 - 1 = 2a + a², where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Numerator becomes 2a + a², denominator (1 +a)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a +a²)/( (1+a)^2 ) )

Factor numerator: a (2 + a )

Denominator: (1 + a )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( a (2+a) ) / (1+a )

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is small unless the amplitude is very large.

Wait, but this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor it differently.

Wait, but perhaps this approach is making it more complicated than necessary. Looking back, the initial approach leads us to the same expression as option D.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is \( E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). When the oscillator reaches equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the relativistic kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement to the kinetic energy at equilibrium:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because they either neglect relativistic effects or misrepresent the energy conservation relationship. For example, **Option C** corresponds to the classical result, which does not account for relativistic mass increase, and **Options A** and **B** have incorrect denominators.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
