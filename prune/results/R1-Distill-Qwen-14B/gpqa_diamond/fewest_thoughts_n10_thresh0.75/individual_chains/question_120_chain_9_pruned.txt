Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (d = 1/plx). So higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with plx. So I need to find, say, N(>plx) or something like that. Or maybe it's the number density in terms of plx. Let me think about the distribution.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is that number density. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by that volume.

But how does parallax relate to distance? Oh right, plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases. So if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx instead of d. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's let u = plx for simplicity. Then du = - (1/d²) dd, but I can rearrange that.

Wait, the number of stars in a range of parallax from u to u+du would correspond to stars at distance d to d+dd, where u = 1/d. So I need to express the number of stars in terms of u.

The volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. Let me express this in terms of u. So d = 1/u, so dd = - (1/u²) du. Hmm, but I think I can drop the negative sign because we're considering small increments in u. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/u)^2 * ( - (1/u²) du ). Wait, no, wait—volume as a function of u would involve 4π (d)^2 dd. So substituting d=1/u and dd in terms of du.

So let's do it step by step.

d = 1/u → u = 1/d.

dd = derivative of d with respect to u. So dd = derivative (1/u) du → which is (-1/u²) du. So when u increases by du, d decreases by (1/u²) du. But since we're looking for a positive volume, perhaps I should take absolute value or adjust the limits. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of u:

n * 4π (1/u)^2 * ( - (1/u²) du )

Wait, but that gives a negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between d and u. When u increases, d decreases. So for a given u, the corresponding d is 1/u, and the change in d when u changes by du is dd = - (1/u²) du.

But for the volume element, we need to consider the change in d as positive. So perhaps the number of stars in a range du around u is n * 4π (d)^2 * (-dd). Wait, because when u increases, d decreases, so to have a positive volume, we have:

N(du) = n * 4π (d)^2 * (-dd) = n * 4π (1/u)^2 * (1/u²) du )

Wait, because dd is negative, so
