Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. 

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky, I think that means their actual spatial distribution is uniform in space, not just on the sky's surface. So like, the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So if I imagine a big sphere expanding out from us, the number of stars inside that sphere is proportional to the volume.

But wait, parallax comes into play here. Parallax (p) is given by p = 1/d, where d is the distance. So when p increases, d decreases. So higher parallax means closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let's think about how the number of stars N depends on plx. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume depends on the volume. 

But how does parallax translate to distance, which relates to volume? So for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance? Let me think. If plx is p, then d is 1/p. So if p increases, the distance decreases. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr.
