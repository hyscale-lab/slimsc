Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh right, and μ is a muon, but I think that's just context and doesn't affect the calculation here.

The task is to figure out which statement among the options A to D is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down what's given. So, the operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by some constants. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, so that fits.

Wait, S is given as having rows (0 -i) and (i 0). That looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli σ matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_y matrix is actually [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which matches exactly with the given S matrix. So S is σ_y. So A_y = c * σ_y.

Wait, no, because the question says S is a 2x2 matrix with that first row. So S is σ_y. And c is h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. 

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are usually S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for S_y and S_z. Oh, because ħ is h/(2π). So if c is h/(4π), then c = (ħ/2). So A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So A_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli y-matrix.

So, the eigenvalues of A_y will be the eigenvalues of (ħ/2) σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, multiplying by (ħ/2) would give eigenvalues of +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). Wait, no, wait: wait, σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y, so the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (±1), so they
