Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). 

So, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The question is about which statement is correct regarding this calculation.

First, I remember that eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues.

Let me write down the matrix S first. S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [ [0,  -i],
       [i,  0] ]

Then, A_y is c multiplied by S. So plugging in c = h/(4π), the matrix A_y becomes:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
         [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Simplifying, that's:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i],
                   [i, 0] ]

Wait, but S itself is a matrix. Let's think about what S represents. S looks like a spin operator matrix. In quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and are used for spin-1/2 systems. Spin matrices are usually scaled by ħ/2. So for example, the Pauli Y matrix is (i times the given S? Let me check.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, that's exactly the same as S here. So S is σ_y.

So, A_y = c * σ_y. And since c is h/(4π), let's see: the standard spin matrices are (ℏ/2) multiplied by Pauli matrices. So if ℏ is h/(2π), then c would be (h/(4π)) = (ℏ/2). So A_y
