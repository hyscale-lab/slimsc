Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the problem says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Alright, first, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The formation of the complex can be represented by the equation: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in a solution where the complex is already present. So the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think this means that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M at the start. 

So, the dissociation of the complex will give me the calcium ions. The reaction is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf, right? So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check. Formation constant is Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So if the complex dissociates, the K for that would be Kd = [M][L]/[complex] = 1/Kf. So yes, Kd is 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the concentration of EDTA is high enough that its concentration is approximately equal to the amount released from the complex, but wait, wait. Hmm, maybe I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model this.

Let me think. Let’s denote the complex concentration as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M initially. When it dissociates, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that comes out. So:

At equilibrium,
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x (assuming that all the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, which is a reasonable assumption if the solution is stoichiometric and other sources of EDTA are negligible).

But wait, in reality, EDTA might come from other sources, but the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution, which probably
