Alright, I'm trying to tackle this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Okay, let's break it down. Hmm, so the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA². Then the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical approach. Hmm.

Relativistic mechanics changes things because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. So I need to think about the relativistic expressions for energy. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy should be the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy might not just be (1/2)kx². Oh wait, the question says it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx, so the potential is still (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma - 1)mc².

So at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is momentarily at rest. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy is equal to the kinetic energy at that point, which is (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²), so substituting that in:

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) mc².

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me
