Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not 100% sure how that method works, but maybe it's not directly relevant here. The key points are about their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and the orbital periods we need to find.

The given data is:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4? Or T2/T1? Wait, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16πσ d²)]^(1/4), where 'a' is albedo, L is star's luminosity, d is distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, assuming same star and albedo.

Wait, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Let me clarify: is it T1/T2 = 1.4 or T2/T1 =1.4? Because the wording says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, usually, when someone says the ratio between A and B is X, it's A/B. But I need to be careful here. Let's say T1/T2 = 1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3? That would mean T3 is colder than T2. Alternatively, if
