Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But in the problem, each state has its own lifetime, so perhaps the measurement time is related to the longer lifetime.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of each state. Because if the difference is larger than each individual uncertainty, it would be resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the system as a whole. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think through the problem again. The two states have lifetimes of τ1 = 1e-9 seconds and τ2 = 1e-8 seconds. The energies are E1 and E2. The question is about the energy difference ΔE = |E2-E1| that allows them to be clearly resolved.

From the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately ħ/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1, which is 1e-34 Js / 1e-9 s = 1e-25 J. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J.

Wait, but these are in joules. I need to convert them to electron volts to match the options. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.24e-7 eV. Similarly, ΔE2 = 1e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.24e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again. Let's take ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1e-25 J = (1e-25) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.24e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s: ΔE2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J → 1e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.24e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties for the two states are approximately 6.24e-7 eV and 6.24e-8 eV, respectively.

Now, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the lines would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

Wait, but the sum is 6.24e-7 + 6.24e-8 = approximately 6.864e-7 eV.

So the difference ΔE must be larger than about 6.86e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6, which is way smaller than 6.8e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is much larger than 6.8e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6, which is larger than 6.24e-8 but smaller than 6.8e-7? Wait, 1e-8 eV is 0.01e-6 eV. 6.86e-7 is about 0.686e-6. So 0.01e-6 is smaller than that. So D is 0.01e-6, which is less than 0.686e-6. So D wouldn't work.

Wait, so option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.8e-7. So that would satisfy the condition. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2, so the minimum ΔE to resolve them would be when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, is that correct? Or is it that the energy difference must be larger than twice the average uncertainty? Or perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the measurement time. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach is that the uncertainty principle tells us that the time of measurement affects the energy resolution. If the measurement time is T, then ΔE ≈ ħ / T.

But in this problem, each state has its own lifetime, so perhaps the measurement time is the longer of the two lifetimes, or perhaps the time is the time over which we can distinguish the two energies.

Wait, perhaps the measurement time is the time during which the states are being observed. If the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, perhaps the measurement time T is the time we let the system evolve, so the time uncertainty is T.

In that case, the energy uncertainty would be ΔE ≈ ħ / T.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the lifetimes are the times over which the states' energies are uncertain. So for E1, the energy is uncertain by ΔE1= ħ/τ1, and E2 is uncertain by ΔE2= ħ/τ2.

In that case, to resolve the two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties, because otherwise the energy levels could overlap in their uncertainties.

So yes, ΔE_diff should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute that sum.

ΔE1 = 6.24e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.24e-8 eV.

Sum is approximately 6.86e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than 6.86e-7 eV. Now check the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 6.86e-7. So that's good.

Options A and B are smaller, so no.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6 eV. 6.86e-7 is 0.686e-6, so D is 0.01e-6 < 0.68e-6, so no.

So the correct answer must be C.


To determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that have lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this with the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is not sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be \( \Delta E = 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly resolve the two energy levels.
