Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I need to figure out what process is happening based on the observations. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the setup: Someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did some in vivo imaging. They saw that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acidâ€”oh, right, the stomach is really acidic, so that would break down proteins. But some made it past that and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches, which are part of the immune system. Then they isolated the proliferating cells and sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

Wait, what's happening here. So the GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gastrointestinal tract. When you take it orally, it goes through the stomach, which has acid, but some of the GFP (on the proteins) didn't survive, which makes sense because stomach acid would denature proteins. But some managed to get through, maybe because the virus is somewhat protected? Or perhaps the proteins were somehow resistant?

Once they reach the intestines, the Peyer patches are involved in immune responses. These patches have immune cells, like antigen-presenting cells, which take up the viral proteins. Then, the immune system reacts, and the cells proliferate. The sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. That variability suggests that some process is causing the genes to change.

I remember that when the immune system responds to an antigen, B cells undergo several processes. One is that they can undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their antibodies. Another is class switching, where the type of antibody is changed, but that doesn't change the variable regions. VDJ recombination happens during the initial formation of B cells in the bone marrow, but that's more about the initial diversity, while somatic hypermutation adds more after activation.

So the scenario is that the B cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches (which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue). When the B cells encounter the antigen (from rotavirus), they get activated. Once activated, they start dividing and differentiating. During this process, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes. This increases the diversity of the antibodies produced, allowing for a more effective immune response.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences is due to somatic hypermutation. That must be option A.

The other options: Complement activation (B) is part of the immune response, but it doesn't directly cause changes in the B cell receptors. Class switching (C) changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but again, doesn't change the variable regions. VDJ recombination (D) is during B cell development in the bone marrow, which is before any antigen exposure, so it's not relevant here because the question describes an active immune response.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other GFP-tagged proteins reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In the Peyer patches, proliferating cells are isolated, and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

This variability is indicative of an immune response where B cells are activated by the rotavirus antigen. Upon activation, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes. This increases the diversity of antibodies produced, enhancing the immune response. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes is therefore consistent with somatic hypermutation.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation (B):** While it plays a role in the immune response, it does not directly cause changes in the variable regions of B cell receptors.
- **Class switching recombination (C):** This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions.
- **VDJ recombination (D):** This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity, but it is not relevant to the active immune response described here.

Thus, the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes is due to somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
