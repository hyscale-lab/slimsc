Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let's break down the information given.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B undergoes reduction with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are two hints provided:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectra: A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cycloketones, so E must be a ketone. Let's think about each step and what it implies.

Starting with compound A. Its reaction with HCN gives B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So A probably has a ketone or aldehyde group. The strong IR peak at ~1750 cm^-1 supports this, as ketones have strong absorption around there.

So A is likely a cyclic ketone. Let me think: when HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, the nitrile group (from HCN) would be reduced. Let me recall: nitriles reduce to amines? Wait, no. Wait, nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd usually get reduced to amines (RCH2NH2?), but wait, wait. Alternatively, in the presence of certain conditions, they can hydrogenate to alkanes. Wait, H2 and Pd would typically reduce triple bonds to single bonds. Wait, but in the case of a nitrile group, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning RCN into RCH2NH2? Or maybe into RCH2NH2 is via LiAlH4, but with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile becomes an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile group (which is a triple bond) is hydrogenated to an amine.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the reaction: when a nitrile (R-Câ‰¡N) is hydrogenated over a catalyst like Pd, it's typically converted to an amine (R-CH2-NH2), but under high pressure. Alternatively, maybe under hydrogenation, it's possible that the nitrile becomes an amine. Let me confirm: yes, hydrogenation of a nitrile with H2 and a catalyst like Pd/BaSO4 gives a primary am
