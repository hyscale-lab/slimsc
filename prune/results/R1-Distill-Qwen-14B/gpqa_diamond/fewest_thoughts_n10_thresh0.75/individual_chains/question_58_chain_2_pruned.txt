Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, right?

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

Starting with Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. String theories operate at high energies and aim to avoid the infinities that plague other quantum theories by having particles as vibrations of strings. But wait, do they still need regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think string theories might have their own ways of handling these issues, but I'm not sure if they completely eliminate the need for regularization. Or maybe because they're background-dependent or have other mechanisms, they don't require it. Not entirely certain yet.

Next, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory that describes the strong interaction. At low energies, QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory with confinement, meaning quarks are stuck inside hadrons. At high energies, like in the early universe or in particle accelerators, QCD becomes asymptotically free, which means the coupling constant decreases, and quarks behave more like free particles. But wait, because QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, it's already a renormalizable theory. Renormal
