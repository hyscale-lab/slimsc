Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron's state and some operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on it. Oh right, the probability of measuring a state is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I should find the normalization factor. The state is in the spin-z basis. So the coefficients are c_up = 1+i and c_down = 2-i. The normalization condition is |c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2 = 1 after scaling.

Calculating |c_up|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.
|c_down|²: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +1 =5.
So the sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), because the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that look like as a matrix?

In the z-basis, the states are |up> and |down>. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix A is:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. It's a Pauli matrix multiplied by something. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) * X. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of X, which are |+> and |->, where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, or is that right? Because when you have an operator that's a multiple of a Pauli matrix, its eigenstates are the same as the Pauli matrix's eigenstates. So yes, A has eigenstates |+> and |->.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the projections onto the eigenstates of A.

Wait, let me think. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

So first, express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to X, the eigenstates are |+> and |->, as I thought.

So let's write |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

But perhaps there's a simpler approach. Alternatively, compute the probabilities by calculating the inner products.

Wait, the eigenstates of A are orthogonal. So if I compute < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >, then the probabilities are the squares of their magnitudes.

Let me write down |+> and |->.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let's compute the amplitude < + | alpha >.

< + | alpha > = ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ) * ( [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So multiplying the coefficients:

= [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: (1+i +2 -i) = 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability P(+ ) is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

< - | alpha > = ( < up | - < down | ) / sqrt(2) ) * ( [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So:

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: (1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i )

So the amplitude is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is | (-1 +2i)|² /14.

Calculate | -1 + 2i |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is around 0.36. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, but wait, that's only if the operator's eigenstates are |+> and |->. Are the eigenvalues 0 and hbar/2? Or something else?

Wait, the operator A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 when i=j. So the matrix is:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

So the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

Determinant: ( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The eigenstates are |+> and |->, as before.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, 9+5=14, so 9/14 is about 0.6428, 5/14 about 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but the average value is the expectation value of A. So E[A] = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X operator, which has expectation value (hbar/2) times the expectation value of X.

The expectation value of X for a state |alpha> is <X> = <alpha| X |alpha>.

But X is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So compute <alpha| X |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> / sqrt(7).

So X|alpha> is (1+i)|down> + (2-i)|up> / sqrt(7).

Then <alpha| X |alpha> is [ (1-i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * [ (1+i)|down> + (2-i)|up> ] /7.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute it as:

<alpha| X |alpha> = (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 + i) all over 7.

Wait, because X swaps |up> and |down>, so when you compute X|alpha>, you get (1+i)|down> + (2-i)|up>, and then inner product with <alpha| is (1-i)<up| + (2 + i) <down|.

So compute the inner product:

(1-i)( (1+i)|down> ) <up| down> is zero. Wait, that's not the right approach. Wait, to compute <alpha|X|alpha>, you have:

= [ (1-i) (2-i) + (2 +i)(1+i) ] /7.

Wait, let me compute each term:

Term 1: (1-i) * (2 -i) → (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → (1 -3i).

Term 2: (2 +i) * (1 +i) → 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i² → 2 +3i -1 → (1 +3i).

So summing term1 + term2: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <alpha| X |alpha> = 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Now looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.

Option B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7). No, our average is hbar/7.

Option C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7). No, average is hbar/7.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). No.

So option A is the only one that matches the probabilities and the average.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the expectation value. Another approach: perhaps compute <A> using matrix elements.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So <A> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) (2 +i) * (hbar/2) ) + (2 -i)(1 +i) * (hbar/2) ) ]

Wait, no, that's not right. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

The conjugate transpose, <alpha|, is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute A * |alpha> first:

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So A * |alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then multiply by <alpha|:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Dot product is:

(1-i)(2 -i) * hbar/(2*(7)) + (2 +i)(1 +i) * hbar/(2*(7)).

Each term is:

( (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ) = 2 -i -2i + i² → 2-3i-1=1-3i.

And the second term: (2)(1) + 2i +i(1) + i² → 2 +3i -1=1+3i.

Add them: (1-3i) + (1+3i) =2.

Multiply by hbar/(2*7): 2 * hbar/(14) = hbar/7.

Yes, same result as before. So the average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are c_up = 1+i and c_down = 2-i. The normalization factor is determined by:

\[
|c_{\text{up}}|^2 + |c_{\text{down}}|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A is given by:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{|\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |−⟩ = \frac{|\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring |+⟩ and |−⟩
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩ are given by the square of the absolute values of the projections:

\[
P(+⟩) = \left| \langle + | α \rangle \right|^2, \quad P(-⟩) = \left| \langle - | α \rangle \right|^2.
\]

#### Projection onto |+⟩:
\[
\langle + | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
\[
P(+⟩) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### Projection onto |−⟩:
\[
\langle - | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
\[
P(-⟩) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of A and the normalized state |α⟩, the expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} (1-i) & (2+i) \end{bmatrix} \cdot A \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

After simplifying, the result is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring |+⟩ and |−⟩ are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of A is ℏ/7. These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
