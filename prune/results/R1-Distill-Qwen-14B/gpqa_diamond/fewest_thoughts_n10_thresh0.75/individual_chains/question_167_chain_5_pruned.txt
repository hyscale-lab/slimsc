Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me think about what each part means.

So the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you have a superposition of them, the state becomes non-Gaussian. Non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is, and here the measure is relative entropy.

The problem gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy formula: del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state |psi> and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I'm not exactly sure about the specific steps, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I should note that the relative entropy between rho and tau is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. So the non-Gaussianity here is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. But wait, no, wait. The relative entropy del_b is defined as S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But I might have the sign wrong; I need to check the formula again. The problem states del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So if rho is more non-Gaussian, it's entropy would be higher than that of tau? Or is it the other way around? Well, I'll proceed as per the formula.

But wait, the question says "the amount of non-Gaussianity is calculated using relative entropy measure." So non-Gaussian states have higher del_b. But what's the reference state tau? Because the reference Gaussian state could be the closest Gaussian state to rho, or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the optimal Gaussian approximation to rho.

Alternatively, perhaps for a two-mode squeezed state or something else, but in this case, the state is a superposition of
