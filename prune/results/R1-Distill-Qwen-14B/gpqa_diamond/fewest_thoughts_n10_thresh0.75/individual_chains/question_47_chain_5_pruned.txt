Okay, I've got this problem about identifying a compound based on spectroscopic data. Let's see what I remember from my organic chemistry class. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a molecular formula I should break down.

The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because they're in that region. But wait, the 3420 is a medium to strong intensity, and 3325 is also strong. Maybe it's an amide or something with N-H bonds. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an amide or ester. Because amides have a carbonyl around there, but also esters. Let me think.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's go through each peak:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group. Like OCH2CH3 or something similar. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an OCH2 or maybe NH2. But wait, if it's OCH2, maybe it's part of an ethyl group. Alternatively, a broad signal could be from an NH group. Hmm, but the IR shows strong N-H bands, so maybe this is an NH2 group. But wait, the singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So if it's NH2, but in a singlet, maybe it's a secondary amine? Or maybe it's part of an amide.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H—quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in ethyl groups. So maybe this is an OCH2CH2... or a CH2 connected to something else. Let me think. If it's a quartet, that means it's next to a CH2 that's split into a triplet. Wait, the 1.20 is a triplet, so that's the CH3 connected to a CH2. So the 4.5 quartet would be the CH2 connected to the CH3, like OCH2CH2... or maybe a CH2 connected to something else.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So, perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring. One is at the para position, maybe.

Now, putting all this together. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees—could be a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and a double bond or ring (maybe one more). Or maybe a benzene ring and an amide or ester.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH-. So the structure would be OCH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring at para position, and the formamide group on the benzene. So the amide is attached to the benzene, with an ethoxy group at para.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester? Or the acid? Well, the formula would be benzene with NH2 at para and a propionoate group. Not sure, but propionate would have a CH2CH2COO- group.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be a benzoate ester. So the structure is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and an amino group at para.

Wait, let's look at the IR. The strong band at 172
