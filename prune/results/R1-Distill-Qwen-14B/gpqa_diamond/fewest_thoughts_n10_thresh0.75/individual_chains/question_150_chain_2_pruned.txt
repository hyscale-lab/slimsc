Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacting with a set of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let me look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But wait, sometimes if it's conjugated, it might be downfield. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a specific environment or maybe an acidic proton like an aldehyde.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes an exchange process can cause a triplet. Like, maybe it's an enol tautomer or something else. But I'm not sure, so I'll tentatively consider it an aldehyde proton for now.

Next, the aromatic region. Let's see:

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): a doublet integrating for 2H. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons are equivalent and show up as a doublet if coupled to another group.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): another doublet for 2H. This might be another pair of para-substituted protons, perhaps on a different aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the molecule has two aromatic rings, perhaps each substituted with something. Let me think about the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a single aromatic ring with substituents that create a doublet for 4H, but that doesn't add up. Wait, wait. The peaks are 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). So two doublets each for 2H. That suggests two separate aromatic rings, each with a substituent that causes the protons to split into a doublet. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe para-substituted phenyl groups attached to something else. So like two phenyl groups, each para-substituted, and each having two protons as doublets. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet? That could be something else, maybe allylic protons or maybe protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a substituted benzene ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enol or something.

Wait, maybe the
