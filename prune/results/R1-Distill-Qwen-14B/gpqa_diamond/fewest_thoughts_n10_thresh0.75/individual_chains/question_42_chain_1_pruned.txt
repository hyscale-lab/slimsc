Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've given me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. All right, let's break it down.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula I recall is something like T = (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. But wait, since all planets orbit the same star, L and σ are the same for all, so T should be inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So, T ∝ 1/√d.

They gave the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, and between Planet2 and Planet3. The ratio T1/T2 is about 1.4, and T2/T3 is about 2.3. So I can chain these ratios to find T1/T3. Let's calculate that.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. T1/T2 is 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 * T2. Then T2/T3 is 2.3, so T3 = T2 / 2.3. So substituting into T1, T1 = 1.4 * T2 = 1.4 * (2.3 * T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3. So T1/T3 ≈ 3.22. So since T is proportional to 1/√d, the ratio of distances d1/d3 would be (T3/T1)^2. So d1/d3 = (1/3.22)^2 ≈ (0.31)^2 = 0.096. So d3 is about 10.4 times d1. Because d3 = d1 * (T1/T3)^2. Wait, wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), so d is proportional to 1/T². So d1/d3 = (T3/T1)^2. So T1 is 3.22 T3, so T3 is T1 /3.22. So (T3/T1) is 1/3.22, so (T3/T1)^2 is about 1/10.36. So d1/d3 = 1/10.36. So d3 is about 10.36 times d
