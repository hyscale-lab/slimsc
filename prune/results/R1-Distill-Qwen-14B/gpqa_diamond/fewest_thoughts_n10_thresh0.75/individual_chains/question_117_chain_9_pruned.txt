Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Or maybe it's about the presence of stereogenic elements like stereocenters or geometric isomerism. Wait, no, optical isomerism specifically refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which causes them to rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, they must have chirality.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations, but for isomerism, especially optical, the groups attached to the benzene rings matter. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers. So, biphenyls can have atropisomerism if the rotation around the central bond is restricted. But for that, the substituents should be bulky enough. Here, we've got nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Since each ring has two substituents (nitro and carboxylate), the arrangement might create a chiral center if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has a plane of symmetry, which would prevent chirality. Wait, I'm not so sure. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. But with two nitro and two methyl groups, maybe they are symmetric. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I'll come back to this one.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure here is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, maybe it's methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is OMe-O-C-O with the acid part being CH2(OH)COO-. Wait, no. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COO- methyl ester. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, actually, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's a straight chain. Does that have a chiral center? The carbon with the OH is the second carbon. Let me see: the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. So, four different groups? Wait, no: the groups are CH2(OH)-
