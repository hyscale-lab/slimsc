Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second. I'm a bit confused because quantum states are usually represented by vectors with complex numbers and normalized. But here, the components are real numbers. Oh, maybe it's a three-dimensional vector, and the components are (-1, 2, 1). But wait, I think quantum states have to be normalized vectors. Let me check the length of this vector.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector should be this vector divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. So the state is (1/sqrt(6))* (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention normalizing. Hmm, maybe I can proceed without normalizing for now and see if it affects the probabilities.

The operators P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

And Q's matrix is:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring first P, then Q.

Wait, no. The question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. What's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

So it's the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the order matters because the state changes upon measurement. So first, we measure P, which collapses the state into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the
