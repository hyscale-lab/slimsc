Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me draw that structure mentally. So, there's a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a methyl group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Also, there's a formyl group (carbaldehyde) on the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane with two substituents: one is a formyl (CHO), and the other is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

I need to find the sequence of reagents that takes ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's see the options given and think about each step.

First, I'm recalling some common reactions for such transformations. Ethynyl groups can undergo various additions, like hydroboration or hydration. But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. Maybe I can do some kind of addition to the triple bond.

Looking at the target, I see a formyl group. That suggests that perhaps a formyl group is being introduced from somewhere, maybe through oxidation. Also, the presence of a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group that's attached to the cyclohexane ring suggests a substitution or addition reaction.

Let me think about the possible steps.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe deprotonating something, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Hmm. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation. But wait, the alkyne in ethynylcyclohexane, if hydrogenated, would become a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure if option A is the right path.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, then Li in liquid NH3, then O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. So first, maybe a deprotonation and ethylation, then a reaction with Li in NH3 which is for elimination or Grignard? Then ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But the target doesn't have a double bond, so maybe that's not right.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd with CaCO3; O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. So, first, deprotonate and methylate. Then hydrogenation with palladium on calcium carbonate (maybe partial hydrogenation?), then ozonolysis with a workup with (CH3)2S which would prevent overoxidation (like forming carboxylic acids, maybe just breaking into aldehydes or ketones), then Ba(OH)2 which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming epoxides? Not sure.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH. Hmm. So, deprotonating and using methanol as a methylating agent? Or maybe as a nucleophile.

Wait, let me think about the general approach. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl, which in turn is attached to hydroxyl and the cyclohexane. The other substituent is a formyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane (RC≡
