Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So I should write down what S looks like.

So S matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), let's compute Ay. So each element of S gets multiplied by c.

Wait, but actually, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually represented with factors. Oh wait, S here is given, so maybe I don't need to worry about that. Let me think about the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it can have two eigenvalues.

Eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let me compute that.

But wait, maybe there's a shortcut because S is a Pauli matrix. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me check what S is here. Looking at the structure:

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually sigma_y. So S = σy.

And sigma matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, in this case, the operator is Ay = c * S. Since c = h/(4π), what's that in terms of ħ? Because Planck's constant h is 2πħ. So h/(4π) is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2.

So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, right? Because σ matrices are Hermitian and have eigenvalues ±1. So if Ay is (ħ/2) * σy, then its eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) * (+1) and (ħ
