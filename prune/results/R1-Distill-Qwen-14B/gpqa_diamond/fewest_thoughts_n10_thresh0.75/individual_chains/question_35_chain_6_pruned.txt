Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, S looks familiar. Oh right! The Pauli matrices. The S matrix here is the Pauli Y matrix, right? The Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used in spin-1/2 systems. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's think about how to calculate eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, Ay is c multiplied by S. So let's compute Ay first. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix Ay would be:

First row: (0, -i*(h/(4π)))
Second row: (i*(h/(4π)), 0)

To find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the determinant equation. The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a        ( -i h/(4π) ) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i^2)(h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, because (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - ( (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 ). So the equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Wait, so the eigenvalues a satisfy a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -
