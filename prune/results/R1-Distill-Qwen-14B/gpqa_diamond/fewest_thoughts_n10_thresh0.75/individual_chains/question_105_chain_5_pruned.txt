Okay, let me try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how their effect on the brightness compares to an exoplanet transit. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, star spots can also cause brightness variations because they are cooler regions.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun, and one hemisphere has dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness changes.

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same amplitude in the light curve, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star. So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what a planet would do.

First, I think I need to calculate the total change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

Let me start by recalling how star spots affect brightness. The spots are darker, so when they are on the visible side (like when the star rotates and the spotted hemisphere faces us), they reduce the observed brightness. The amount depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The filling factor is 0.2, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) )? Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire star's surface.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 0.2, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each spot is cooler: their temperature is 5000 K compared to the star's 6000 K. The flux from a spot is less than the surrounding. The flux from a spot is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4.

So the flux from the spotted area is σ (5000)^4, and the surrounding (unspotted) parts of the hemisphere have σ (6000)^4.

The total flux from the star when the spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the spots and the rest of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but when the star is observed, its brightness is the sum of all the parts we see. So when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the total flux is:

Flux = (Area without spots) * F6000 + (Area with spots) * F5000.

But the area without spots is the hemisphere area minus the spots. Since the filling factor is 0.2, the unspotted area is 0.8 * (hemisphere area). So hemisphere area is 2πR², so unspotted area is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

So flux when spots are visible is:

(1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without any spots would be when the hemisphere is all at 6000 K: (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

The relative change in flux (delta F) is [Flux_spots - Flux_no_spots] / Flux_no_spots.

Calculating that:

Delta F = [ (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) - (2 * 6000^4) ] * σ R² π / (2 σ R² π)

Wait, wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change. Because the  σ R² π terms will cancel out.

So, let's compute the fractional change delta F as:

[ (0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)) / (6000^4) ) - 1 ] 

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the hemisphere, the observed flux comes from the entire hemisphere, which is 2π R² area. But in the case without spots, the hemisphere is all 6000 K.

So, the fraction is:

( (1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4) ) / (2 *6000^4) ) - 1.

Wait,
