Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots covering that hemisphere. The problem says that when one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations (like brightness over time) show periodic dips because the star is rotating, modulating the light. And this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. So the question is, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do?

Hmm. So I need to compare the amplitude of the brightness dip caused by the spots to what an exoplanet would cause. The goal is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit causes the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Let me think about how brightness variations work. When a star has spots, it's not emitting as much light from those areas. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the total brightness we observe decreases. Similarly, when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip.

But wait, the spots are cooler, so their contribution to the star's light is less. So each spot is emitting less than the surrounding areas. But when the star rotates, we see more or less of the spotted area. So the observed flux (brightness) changes accordingly.

First, maybe I should calculate the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots. Then, calculate the fractional change caused by a planet of radius Rpl, and set them equal to find Rpl.

The formula for the fractional change due to a planet is well-known. The transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if the planet's radius is Rp and the star's radius is Rstar, the area blocked is πRp² / πRstar² = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But for the star with spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. Let me model this.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4πRstar² * sigma * Teff^4. But wait, actually, that's the total power emitted. The flux we observe is the power per unit area on the star's surface, integrated over the visible area. But maybe I should think in terms of the contribution of the spots versus the rest.

The effective temperature of the spots is Teff_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000K. The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) / 2. Wait, let me make sure.

Wait,
