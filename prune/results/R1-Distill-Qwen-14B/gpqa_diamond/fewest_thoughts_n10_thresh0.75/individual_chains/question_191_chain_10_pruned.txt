Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down each reaction and see what's happening.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me visualize the structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-CH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond starts at C1, and the substituent is at C2. So it's CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh right, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2) attached where? Wait, the group is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-, but attached at the middle carbon? Wait, maybe it's the vinylic group. Let me think again. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. No, wait, that would be prop-1-en-2-yl as CH2=CH-CH2-, but attached at the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps it's the same as isopropenyl group. Oh right, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually another name for isopropenyl. So the group at position 5 is an isopropenyl group, which is CH2=C(CH2-) attached. Wait, no, isopropenyl is CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent is CH2=C(CH3) attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 5. So
