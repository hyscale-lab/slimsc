Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation, which deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the ratio here is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. Let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. So when the temperature changes, the ratio changes.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me think. The transition between the two levels is at about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. So this is probably the ionization or excitation of Ti.

Wait, but the problem says it's neutral Ti, so maybe it's about excitation rather than ionization. So the energy difference between the two levels is probably small, so maybe the ratio is sensitive to temperature changes.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), each region emits according to its local temperature.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But what's the actual situation? The spots are cooler, so the parts of the surface without spots are hotter. Or do the spots just reduce the overall emission?

Wait, the star's surface is 40% covered by spots. The spots are dark, so they have lower temperature than the surrounding photosphere. So the star as a whole has a lower effective temperature, but the areas not covered by spots are still at 6000 K, while the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's average is lower because spots are cooler.

But for the photosphere itself, when considering the Ti atoms, are they in regions with different temperatures? Or does the presence of spots affect the average temperature experienced by the Ti atoms?

Wait, the problem says the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So each part of the photosphere is in LTE. So the parts with spots have a lower temperature, and the rest have higher.

But when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. So, when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. But wait, no. Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation, so it's the average. But the Ti atoms are in regions where the temperature is either 6000 K (60% of the surface) or lower (40% spots, perhaps). But how does that affect the observed line ratio?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the effect on the excitation of Ti atoms in the entire photosphere. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the average temperature. Hmm, but that's not entirely correct because the presence of spots would cause the star to have a lower flux, but the line formation in each region depends on the local temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? That doesn't make sense because spots are cooler. So I must be misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature of the entire photosphere as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. But that can't be right because the spotted areas are cooler and the rest are the same. So the effective temperature depends on the sum of the flux from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that the entire photosphere cools to 5500 K when the spots are present. But that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler than the surrounding. So maybe the model is that the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest of the surface is still at 6000 K.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a two-component problem.

So, when the star has spots, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_s. The effective temperature of the star as a whole is 5500 K.

So the way to find T_s is to compute the effective temperature when part of the surface is at 6000 K and the other part at T_s, which lowers the overall Teff to 5500 K.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the flux from each part is sigma * T^4.

The total flux is the sum of each part: (0.6 * sigma * 6000^4) + (0.4 * sigma * T_s^4) ) = sigma * (5500)^4.

Dividing both sides by sigma, we get 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_s^4) = (5500)^4.

We can solve for T_s^4.

Let me compute the numbers.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is (5.5^2)^2 = 30.25^2 ≈ 915.0625 → 9.150625e2 → 9.150625e2 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

So equation:

0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * T_s^4 = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15: 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4 T_s^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4 T_s^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

Divide by 0.4:

T_s^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T_s.

The fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Let me compute that.

We can think in terms of 1e14^(1/4) = (1e14)^0.25 = 1e3.5 ≈ 3.16e3 K.

But wait, let's compute T_s^4 = 3.4365625e14.

What's 3.4365625e14?

We can write it as 3.4365625 * 1e14.

We know that (3e3)^4 = 81e12 = 8.1e13. So 3e3 is 3000, T=3000 would give T^4=8.1e13. But our value is 3.4365625e14, which is about 4.24 times higher than 8.1e13.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

I can compute the fourth root step by step.

First, take the natural logarithm: ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14).

ln(3.4365625) ≈ 1.234.

ln(1e14) = 14 * ln(10) ≈ 14 * 2.302585 ≈ 32.236.

So ln(T_s^4) = 1.234 +32.236 = 33.47.

Then, (1/4) * ln(T_s^4) = ln(T_s) = 33.47/4 ≈ 8.3675.

So T_s = e^8.3675.

e^8 is about 2980. e^8.3675 is e^(8 + 0.3675) = e^8 * e^0.3675.

e^0.3675 ≈ 1.444. So 2980 * 1.444 ≈ 4294 K.

Wait, but wait, 4294 K is the temperature of the spots? That seems a bit high for a 'dark spot'—spots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So if the surrounding is 6000 K, spots being 4294 K would be much cooler, but perhaps not unreasonable.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_s^4) = 5500^4.

Compute 6000^4: 6^4 = 1296; 6000 is 6e3, so (6e3)^4 = (6^4)*(e3)^4) = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.6 * 1.296 = 0.7776 → 7.776e14.

5500^4: 5.5e3, so (5.5)^4 = (5.5^2)^2 = (30.25)^2 = 915.0625.

So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So equation: 7.776e14 + 0.4 T_s^4 = 9.150625e14.

0.4 T_s^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

T_s^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Now, take the fourth root. Let me compute 3.4365625e14.

The fourth root of 3.4365625e14 equals approximately (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

(1e14)^(1/4) is (1e3.5) ) = about 3162.278 K.

Wait, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, because 3.5 *4 =14. So 1e3.5 is sqrt(1e7) = 3162.278.

So (3.4365625)^(1/4) ≈ let's compute that.

3.4365625 is approximately 3.44.

What's the fourth root of 3.44?

I know that 1.3^4 = 2.8561; 1.4^4=3.8416. So 3.44 is between 1.3^4 and 1.4^4.

Let me compute 1.35^4: 1.35^2=1.8225. Then square that: (1.8225)^2 ≈ 3.32. So 1.35^4 ≈ 3.32.

1.36^2 = (1.35 +0.01)^2 = 1.35^2 + 2*1.35*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 1.8225 +0.027 + 0.0001 =1.8496. Then square that: (1.8496)^2 ≈ (1.8)^2=3.24 plus some. Wait, 1.8496 *1.8496.

Let me compute 1.8496 *1.8496:

Approximate:

1.8 *1.8 =3.24.

1.8 * 0.0496= approx 0.08928.

0.0496 *1.8= same.

0.0496 *0.0496 ≈ 0.00246.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1.8496^2 as (1.85 - 0.0004)^2.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.36^4.

1.36^2: 1.8496.

1.8496^2: Let's compute 1.8496 *1.8496.

= (1.8 + 0.0496)^2

= (1.8)^2 + 2*(1.8)*(0.0496) + (0.0496)^2

= 3.24 + 0.17856 + 0.00246016

= 3.24 + 0.17856 = 3.41856; plus 0.00246 is ≈3.42102.

So 1.36^4 ≈3.42102.

But our value is 3.4365625, which is slightly higher.

So, the fourth root of 3.43656 is a bit higher than 1.36.

Let me compute 1.362^4.

First, 1.362^2: 1.362 *1.362. Let's compute:

1.36 *1.36 = 1.8496.

Wait, 1.362^2 = (1.36 + 0.002)^2 = 1.36^2 + 2*(1.36)(0.002) + (0.002)^2 = 1.8496 + 0.00544 + 0.000004 = 1.855044.

Then, (1.855044)^2 = ?

Compute 1.855^2:

(1.85)^2 = 3.4225.

(1.855)^2 = (1.85 + 0.005)^2 = (1.85)^2 + 2*(1.85)*(0.005) + (0.005)^2.

= 3.4225 + 0.0185 + 0.000025 = 3.441025.

So 1.362^4 ≈ 3.441025.

But our target is 3.4365625.

So 1.362^4 ≈3.441025, which is a little higher than 3.43656. So perhaps the fourth root is around 1.361.

So, to compute T_s:

Fourth root of 3.4365625e14 is 1.361 * (1e3.5) ≈ 1.361 * 3162.278 ≈ 4307 K.

Wait, but earlier calculation with natural logs gave around 4294 K. Close enough, perhaps.

So T_s is about 4294 K.

So when the star has spots, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K and 40% at ~4294 K.

But how does that affect the excitation of Ti atoms?

Wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

The ratio depends on the temperature according to the Boltzmann factor.

The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Assuming E1 < E2, so the exponent is negative, and the ratio is less than one.

Wait, no, wait. If E1 is the lower energy level, then E1 < E2. So E1 - E2 = - (E2 - E1). So the exponent becomes (E2 - E1)/(k T). So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

If Ti is neutral, then the energy difference (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative, making exp(-x) a small number. But the ratio (n1/n2) is (g1/g2)*exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp increases, making the ratio (n1/n2) larger.

Wait, no, if T increases, then (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller. So the exponent is a smaller negative number, so exp becomes larger. So ratio increases.

Wait, let's take an example. If T is high, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher, because more atoms are in higher energy states (relax, higher T means more thermal energy to populate higher levels). So, when T increases, n2 increases relative to n1, so n1/n2 decreases. Wait, no: n2 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, let me think. n1 is the lower state, n2 the higher.

At higher T, more atoms are in the higher state, so n2 increases more than n1. So n1/n2 would decrease as T increases.

Wait, that's correct. Because Boltzmann factor for level 2 is higher at higher T, so n2 is higher, thus the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

So in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, which matches what the problem says.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature, and the line ratio is based on that average.

But wait, the star's photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE. So the observed line ratio would be a combination of the contributions from both regions. But the problem seems to be asking about the ratio when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. But perhaps the question is considering the average, or perhaps it's considering the change in the overall effective temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is oversimplifying and considering the average temperature, so when the star has spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. So the Ti atoms would be in a photosphere that's at 5500 K.

But that's not correct because the actual temperatures vary across the surface.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, but the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So perhaps the entire photosphere cools to 5500 K when the spots are present, but that's not physically accurate. Spots are cooler regions, but the surrounding is hotter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the effective temperature is 5500 K, so when looking at the entire photosphere, the average temperature is 5500 K. So when calculating the line ratio, it's based on 5500 K, compared to 6000 K without spots.

Wait, but that would make the ratio (n1/n2) at 6000 K divided by the ratio at 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio is lower because the temperature is lower.

Wait, let me correct that.

At higher T: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, the ratio (n1/n2) increases or decreases?

E2-E1 is positive. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(...) increases.

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (positive)/(k T) )

So if T increases, (n1/n2) increases. Because if T is larger, the exponential term is larger (since denominator is larger, the exponent becomes less negative).

Wait, no. Let me think numerically.

Suppose E2 - E1 = 1000 K * k (so 1000 K in terms of k's units).

At T = 5000 K,

exp(-1000/(5000)) = exp(-0.2) ≈ 0.8187.

At T = 6000 K,

exp(-1000/(6000)) ≈ exp(-0.1667) ≈ 0.8466.

So the ratio increases from 0.8187 to 0.8466 when T increases from 5000 to 6000 K.

So higher T leads to higher (n1/n2) ratio.

So in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective Teff is 5500 K. So the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when the star doesn't have spots (6000 K).

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = ?

We need to compute the ratio of the ratios.

Let me denote R as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So R_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )

R_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) - (E2-E1)/(k *6000) ) ] )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ] )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (500) / (5500 * 6000) )

Hmm, let's compute the exponent.

But wait, what is the energy difference (E2-E1)? The problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So this is the energy difference between the two levels.

E = hc / λ.

So E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Angstrom = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )

= approx 1.373e-18 J.

But we need E in terms of k*T. So let's compute E/(k) where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ approx 9.95e4 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So the exponent in the factor is:

(99,500 K) * (500) / (5500 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 5500 *6000 = 33,000,000.

So 500 / 33e6 = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = (5/33) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.1515 * 1e-5 ≈ 1.515e-6.

Multiply by 99,500 K: 99,500 * 1.515e-6 ≈ (approx 100,000 *1.5e-6) = 0.15.

More accurately: 99,500 * 1.515e-6.

Let me compute 99500 *1.515e-6.

= (99500 * 1.515) *1e-6.

99500 *1.515 ≈ let's compute 100,000 *1.515 = 151,500. Subtract 500 *1.515 =757.5 → 151,500 -757.5=150,742.5.

So 150,742.5 *1e-6 = 0.1507425.

So the exponent is 0.15074.

So the factor is exp(0.15074) ≈ e^0.15 ≈ 1.1618, e^0.15074 ≈ ?

Wait, e^0.15 is approximately 1.1618.

But let me compute more accurately.

e^0.15074: let's use the Taylor expansion.

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

x≈0.15074.

x=0.15074.

x^2= 0.022722.

x^3=0.003423.

x^4=0.000516.

So,

e^x ≈ 1 + 0.15074 + 0.022722/2 + 0.003423/6 + 0.000516/24.

Compute each term:

1 → 1.

+0.15074 → 1.15074.

+0.022722/2 = 0.011361 → 1.1621.

+0.003423/6 ≈ 0.0005705 → 1.16267.

+0.000516/24 ≈ 0.0000215 → 1.16269.

So e^0.15074 ≈ 1.1627.

So the factor is approximately 1.163.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1. That's close but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the factor I'm calculating is R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

But wait, when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. But earlier I considered that as the temperature being 5500 K, but perhaps the actual temperature for the Ti atoms is lower than that because the spots are cooler, and the surrounding is 6000 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the effective temperature but the actual temperature of the regions where the Ti atoms are. So, the Ti atoms are in regions that are either the hot (6000 K) regions or the cooler (4294 K) spots.

But the line ratio would be a combination of the two regions. So the observed ratio would be a weighted average based on the flux contribution from each region.

Ah, this complicates things. So the line ratio is not simply based on 6000 K and 5500 K, but a combination of 6000 K (60% of surface) and T_s = ~4294 K (40% of surface).

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the ratio changes. So perhaps we need to calculate the average ratio considering both regions.

Wait, but the problem says the photosphere is in LTE. So each part of the photosphere emits according to its local temperature, and the overall line is a sum of contributions from each region.

So, the line ratio would be a weighted average based on the flux from each region.

Wait, but the ratio of Ti atoms in each region is determined by the local temperature. So, the line ratio observed would be a flux-weighted average of the ratios from each region.

So, the observed ratio R_total is:

(R_6000 * F_6000 + R_Ts * F_Ts) / (F_6000 + F_Ts)

Where F is the flux from each region.

Wait, but no. Because the line ratio is a ratio of line strengths, which depends on the number of atoms in each level. The line strength is proportional to the number of atoms in the upper level (for absorption lines), but perhaps for this problem, the ratio n1/n2 is what matters.

But since the line ratio is a flux-weighted average of the ratios in each region, perhaps this is the correct approach.

But this approach is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the average temperature is 5500 K, and the ratio is based on that.

But that's unclear.

Wait, the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere when the star has spots. So, perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, but in reality, part of the photosphere is hotter and part is cooler.

Therefore, the line ratio would be a function of the temperature where the line is formed.

So, the observed line ratio is a sum of the contributions from each region. Each region has its own (n1/n2) ratio, and the flux from each region is proportional to the area times the Planck function at the line wavelength.

Wait, but the line is formed in the photosphere, so the line strength depends on the number of absorbers in each region.

The flux from each region would be F = sigma * T^4 * area, but for the line, it's more about the number of absorbers in that region.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at the effective temperature of 5500 K when the star has spots. So the ratio is based on 5500 K instead of 6000 K.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the actual photosphere has areas at different temperatures. So the line ratio would be a combination, and the effective ratio observed would be a weighted average.

So, perhaps the observed (n1/n2) ratio when spots are present is a flux-weighted average of (n1/n2) at 6000 K and at 4294 K.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about whether the problem expects me to use the effective temperature directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and the line ratio is calculated using this temperature.

So, the factor is exp( (E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which, as computed earlier, is approximately 1.16, which is close to option A (~1.1), but not exactly.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent.

E/(k) is 99,500 K.

The exponent is E/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99500 * ( (6000 -5500) / (5500 *6000) ) )

= 99500 * (500) / (33,000,000 )

= 99500 * 500 / 3.3e7

Compute 99500 = ~1e5.

1e5 *500 =5e7.

5e7 /3.3e7 ≈1.515.

So, 99500 * 500/(3.3e7) = (approx) 1.515.

Wait, no, wait. 99500 *500 = 49,750,000.

Divide by 3.3e7 → 49,750,000 /33,000,000 ≈1.5075.

So the exponent is E/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 99500 * (1.5075e-4) → Wait, no, wait.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, the term (1/5500 -1/6000) is 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000.

So 99500 * (1/66,000) ≈99500 /66,000 ≈1.5075.

So the exponent is 1.5075.

So exp(1.5075) ≈ e^1.5075.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

So 1.5075 is about 1.5, so e^1.5075 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, more accurately, e^1.5075.

Compute e^1.5075 ≈ ?

We know e^1.5 ≈4.4817.

1.5075 is 0.0075 more than 1.5.

The derivative of e^x at x=1.5 is e^1.5 ≈4.4817.

So delta x=0.0075, delta y ≈4.4817 *0.0075 ≈0.0336.

So e^1.5075 ≈4.4817 +0.0336=4.5153.

So approximately 4.515.

So the factor is ~4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the exponent was 0.15, but that was under the assumption that we're considering the average temperature change from 6000 to 5500 K. But when I correct the calculation, the exponent is 1.5, leading to a factor of ~4.5.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the exponent was (E/(k)) * (1/5500 -1/6000) ≈1.5075, so the factor is e^1.5075≈4.515.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought I made a mistake in computing the exponent as 0.15, but perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, E/(k) is 99,500 K.

The term (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) )=500/(33,000,000)=1/66,000 ≈1.515e-5.

So E/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) =99500 *1.515e-5 =99500 * 0.00001515.

Compute 99500 * 0.00001515.

99500 = 9.95e4.

0.00001515=1.515e-5.

Multiply 9.95e4 *1.515e-5 = (9.95 *1.515) *1e-1.

9.95 *1.515 ≈15.07.

So 15.07 *0.1 ≈1.507.

Ah, so the exponent is 1.507, not 0.15. So exp(1.507)≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

So the correct answer is option C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio depends on the temperature \(T\), and higher temperatures increase the ratio because the exponential term becomes larger as \(T\) increases.

The problem specifies that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), the energy difference is:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

To express this in terms of \(kT\), we divide by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, we calculate the factor by which the ratio changes when the star transitions from no spots (\(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) to having spots (\(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\)). The factor is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,500 \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
\]

First, compute the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
99,500 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.5075.
\]

Thus, the factor becomes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.5075) \approx 0.221.
\]

This means the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately \(1 / 0.221 \approx 4.5\) when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
