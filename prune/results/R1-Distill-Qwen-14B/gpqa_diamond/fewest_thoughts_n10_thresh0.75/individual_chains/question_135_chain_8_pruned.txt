Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, the way it's written might be a typo, but I think the interaction term is something like λ times a fermion field ψ_f multiplied by X. Oh, right, because bosons couple to fermions via some interaction term. So probably it's something like λ ψ_f^† γ^μ γ⁵ ψ_f X, but maybe the specifics don't matter here. What's important is which fermions X can decay into.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find which fermions have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass because for a decay X → f f̄, each fermion must have mass ≤ m_X / 2. Because in a decay process, the rest mass of the products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle. So if X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Let me list the masses of all known fermions. Wait, but I need to remember the approximate masses:

- Electron (e⁻): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (current algebra estimate around 2 MeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV (similar to u, about 4 MeV)
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV (about 95 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Also, neutrinos are super light, but the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe we can ignore them.

Wait, but wait. The decay would be X → f f̄. Each f must have mass ≤ 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be a decay product.

So let's see:

- e⁻: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ⁻: 0.105 → yes
- τ: 1.777 → yes
- u: 0.003 → yes
- d: 0.004 → yes
- s: 0.095 → yes
- c: 1.275 → yes
- b: 4.13 → no, because 4.13 >3.

Top quark is way over, so no. So possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, and c.

So the possible decay channels would be X → e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but in the options, let's look.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

But wait, the b quark is about 4 GeV, which is more than 3, so b can't be produced. So X can't decay into b and anti-b. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. So that includes c, which is 1.275 GeV, which is allowed. So yes, all the fermions in option B have masses ≤3 GeV. So B includes c, which is allowed. So B would have all the allowed except for perhaps t, which is not included.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t, ... Wait, t is top quark, which is way too heavy. So option C can't be right because it includes t. So C is out.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. Again, includes b which is too heavy, so D is wrong.

So the correct option is B because all the fermions listed in B have masses ≤3 GeV.

Wait,
