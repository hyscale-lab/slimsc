Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's try to understand the reactions given. 

The first reaction is between solid A and gas B. It uses 8 equivalents of B, producing bright red product C. I'm thinking about what reactions produce bright red products. I remember that when metals like copper react, certain compounds can be red. Maybe A is copper? Because copper compounds can be blue, green, or red. For example, copper(I) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a different metal, but red makes me think of some transition metal compound.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced from C and D. What's a dangerous product from such reactions? Maybe something like a gas that's toxic or explosive. Chlorine comes to mind, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a type of acid, but that's just a guess.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G weak, perhaps C is a sulfide or another compound that hydrolyzes to form acids. Let's think: for example, if C is a sulfide like CuS, but that might not produce two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt. Wait, when a salt reacts with water and produces acids, maybe C is a nitride? Like Na3N, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate or something else, but I need to think more.

Another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D reacts with B to form H. If B is a gas, maybe it's something like O2 or Cl2. Let me think: if B is O2, then D could be H2, forming H2O, which is a solvent. But O2 and H2 reacting to form H2O? Wait, but that's combustion, but H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, another approach: maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2, forming HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is CO2, and B is something else. Or maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S, but that's a gas. Let me think again.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like ethanol, water. Let's think: if H is water, then D and B could be H2 and O2. But they react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. That might make sense. But B is a gas, so O2 is a gas, D would be H2, another gas.

But let me go back to the first reaction. Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms C. If B is O2, then
