Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? Let me check the norm. The vector has elements -1, 2, 1. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first. So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

Wait, but the question says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So perhaps that's the state before any measurement? Because in quantum mechanics, measurements can affect the state. So if a measurement of P is made first, the state could collapse into an eigenstate of P, and then a measurement of Q is made on that new state.

Wait, the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. Oh, right, so the sequence is: measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state. So first, we need to find the possible outcomes of P and the corresponding states.

Let me first look at operator P. The matrix is given:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, wait, I should write it out properly.

So P matrix:
Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, so that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P. Because when we measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, and the outcome is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P, perhaps I can find them. But let me see.

Alternatively, since the matrix might be Hermitian, which it should be for an observable. Let me check. Are the elements complex conjugates across the diagonal? The given elements are real, so it's symmetric, yes. So P is Hermitian, which is good.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation.

The matrix P is:

| 0      1/√2    0      |
|1/√2    0      1/√2   |
| 0      1/√2    0      |

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, we can set up the equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -λ    1/√2    0   ]
[1/√2  -λ     1/√2 ]
[
