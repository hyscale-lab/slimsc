Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, the question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass of the nucleus would be approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, actually, the exact mass might be a bit less because of binding energy, but for this calculation, I might just use the mass of the nucleus as 6u. Or should I use the exact mass? Hmm, I'll have to check that.

The problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is 0.96c, which is pretty fast, so we need to use relativistic equations. The energy in relativity is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me calculate that. 

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9
