Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second. Usually, quantum states are represented as vectors, but these elements don't look normalized because the sum of their squares is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh right, so the vector isn't normalized. I think the first thing I should do is normalize it because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be unit vectors.

So, the state vector ψ is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. That makes sense.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. The operator P has the matrix with first row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out.

P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],
     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
     [0, 1/√2, 0]]

And the operator Q has matrix [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. Oh, that's a diagonal matrix, which probably means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the question says if someone measures Q just after measuring P. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—no, wait, no. Let me read the question again. "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—no, wait, no, the actual wording is, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?"

Wait, no, the wording is, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So when they first measure P, and get 0, then measure Q, and get -1. So the problem is about the combined probability of these two outcomes happening in sequence.

Wait, but when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when Q is measured, it's in that new state. So we need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then measuring Q in that new state gives -1.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on this. Let's break it down step by step.
