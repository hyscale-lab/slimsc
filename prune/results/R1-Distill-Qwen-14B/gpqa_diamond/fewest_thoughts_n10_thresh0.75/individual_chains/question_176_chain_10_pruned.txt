Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The problem says the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think I need to normalize that because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh right, so the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Because you always have to normalize the state, right?

Next, there are two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding matrices are given. I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.

The matrix for P is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, let me write that out properly. So P is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

And Q's matrix is:
Row 1: [1, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -1]

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That means the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, or -1. And the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, I think. Because Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are along the x, y, z axes or something like that. So the eigenstates for Q are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, which are the standard basis vectors.

But wait, the problem is about measuring P first, then Q. Or wait, no, the order is: measure P, then Q. Wait, the
