Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's probably good for detailed observations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to think through this carefully.

The question is asking how many of the listed stars would be detectable. The condition is that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) should be at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to figure out for each star whether it meets this S/N requirement.

First, I should probably recall what factors affect the S/N ratio in spectroscopy. The main factors I think are: the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like background noise and readout noise.

ESPRESSO is mounted on the VLT, which has 8-meter telescopes. So each telescope has a large collecting area, which would help gather more light. But when it's coupled with ESPRESSO, I think it's used as a single telescope or maybe in some combination? Wait, I remember reading that ESPRESSO can combine the light from up to four VLT telescopes to increase its light-gathering power. Oh wait, but the question says it's coupled with one of the 8m telescopes. So maybe it's not using the combined light, just one. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sureâ€”maybe the ESPRESSO instrument can use multiple telescopes, but the question specifies one, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

The S/N depends on the flux from the star. The formula I remember is something like S/N proportional to (flux)^(1/2) * sqrt(exposure time). So higher flux (brighter star) and longer exposure time both improve the S/N. But for this question, exposure time is fixed at 1 hour.

The brightness of a star can be determined by its apparent magnitude. The apparent magnitude depends on the absolute magnitude and the distance. Absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 parsecs. So for each star, I should calculate their apparent V magnitude.

The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs.

So let's compute m for each star:

a) Canopus
I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I can look up its absolute magnitude and distance. Wait, Canopus is about 330 light-years away, which is about 100 parsecs. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.73 or something like that. So M is about -5.73, d=100 pc.

m = (-5.73) + 5 + 5*log10(100/10)
log10(10) is 1, so 5*1=5. So m = (-5.73
