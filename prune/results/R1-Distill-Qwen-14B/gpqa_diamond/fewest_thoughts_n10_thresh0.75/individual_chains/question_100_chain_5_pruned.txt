Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. That's probably propene or propane, but since the formula is C3H6, which is less hydrogen than propane (which is C3H8), it's more likely propene (an alkene). Right, propene is C3H6.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride is a solvent, but I think it's more about the conditions. Bromination of alkenes typically leads to addition reactions. So, propene (CH2CH2CH3?) Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When it undergoes bromination, probably with Br2, it would add across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1-bromo-1-propene? Wait, no, bromine adds across the double bond, so we get 1,2-dibromopropane. Structure would be BrCH2CHBrCH3? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Or maybe it's a 1,2 addition. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an elimination reaction. So, if we have 1,2-dibromopropane and treat it with alcoholic KOH, we'll get an elimination reaction. Wait, but with two adjacent Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination? So, perhaps it loses HBr twice, leading to a triple bond? Because if each Br is on adjacent carbons, removing two HBr would form an alkyne. So, CH2=CHCH3 would have added Br to both CH2 and CH, leading to BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. Then, with alcoholic KOH, it would lose two HBr molecules to form propyne (CHâ‰¡CHCH3) or maybe 1-propyne? Or wait, maybe it's 2-propyne. Wait, propyne is the same as 1-propyne if it's on the end. So, compound C
