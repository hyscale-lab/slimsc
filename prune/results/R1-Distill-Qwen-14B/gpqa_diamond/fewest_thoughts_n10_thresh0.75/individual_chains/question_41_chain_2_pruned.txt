Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, okay, so the setup is that there's a glass slab moving at velocity v. The light beam is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam, but towards the observer? Wait, no, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me visualize this.

Let me try to imagine the scenario. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the lab, which is presumably stationary relative to the glass when it's not moving. But the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, that would mean the glass's velocity is in the opposite direction of the light beam? Or same direction?

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that might not make sense. If the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity
