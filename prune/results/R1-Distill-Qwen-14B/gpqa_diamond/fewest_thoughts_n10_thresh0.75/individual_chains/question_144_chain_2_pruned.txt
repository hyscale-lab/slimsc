Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are in the range of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so pretty tiny distances.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that this has something to do with the particle's lifetime and speed. Oh right! The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula I recall is L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, I also remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ (the width) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Oh right, the relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But since Γ is given in GeV, I'll need to convert units properly.

First, let's handle the units. Let me jot down all the constants I might need. Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. That might come in handy.

So, step by step.

1. Calculate the proper lifetime tau of the meson X.
   Tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s. So I need to convert Γ to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

   So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that.

   6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875e-25. Wait no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait no, 6.5
