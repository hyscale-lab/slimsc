Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. 

So, first, I remember that when high-energy particles like gamma-rays interact with the CMB, their mean free path is determined by the probability of such interactions. If the interaction probability is high enough, the gamma-rays can't travel far, so their lifetime is limited by this process.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, the CMB photons are usually considered to have energies around a milli-eV, right? So each CMB photon has energy much less than that of the high-energy gamma-rays we're considering.

I think the process in question is pair production, where two gamma-rays collide and produce an electron-positron pair. But wait, actually, the reaction here is a gamma-ray annihilating with a CMB photon to produce the pair. So it's a photon-photon collision, but one of them is high energy and the other is low energy (CMB).

The key here might be the cross-section for this process. I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon interactions leading to pair production depends on the energies of the photons involved. 

The cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- is given by the formula σ = (8π/3) (α²/(m_e²)) (1/(s)), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is σ ≈ (3 * α² * m_e²) / (4 * E1 * E2), but I might be getting the exact expression wrong. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section scales as 1/(E1 * E2) when E1 and E2 are large compared to m_e.

Wait, more accurately, the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is given by σ = (8 π α² m_e²)/(3 (E1 E2)) ) when the photon energies are much higher than the electron mass. So, yes, σ ∝ 1/(E1 * E2).

But wait, in this case, one of the photons is a high-energy gamma-ray (Eγ) and the other is a CMB photon (E_cmb). Since E_cmb is much smaller than Eγ, it's E_cmb ≈ 1e-3 eV, and Eγ is in GeV or higher.

So the cross-section becomes σ ≈ (8 π α² m_e²)/(3 Eγ E_cmb).

But wait, the cross-section is a function of the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, I think the threshold condition for pair production (γγ → e+e-) requires that the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c². So, the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c², where s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision), the invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Wait, no, because photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). So, for head-on collision, the total energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2, and the momentum squared is (E1/(c) - E2/(c))^2 c² = (E1 - E2)^2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2.

The threshold condition is s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. So 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ m_e² c^4. Since E1 is the gamma-ray energy and E2 is the CMB photon energy (~1e-3 eV), we can write Eγ * E_cmb ≥ m_e² c^4.

Wait, but for the purposes of finding the interaction rate, maybe the cross-section is only significant when the photon energies are high enough that the interaction can occur. So perhaps the condition is Eγ * E_cmb ≈ m_e² c^4, which sets the threshold for the process.

But wait, no, the threshold would be when Eγ * E_cmb = m_e² c^4. Because at that point, the invariant mass is exactly 2 m_e c², so the pair can be produced.

So, solving for Eγ:

Eγ = (m_e² c^4) / E_cmb.

But wait, let's plug in the numbers. m_e is about 0.511 MeV. So m_e² is (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2 ≈ 0.26 MeV².

E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV. Let's convert units. 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV. So E_cmb = 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV.

So,

Eγ = (0.26 MeV²) / (1e-9 MeV) ) = 0.26e9 MeV = 2.6e8 MeV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 2.6e8 MeV is 2.6e5 GeV. Wait, no: 2.6e8 MeV = 2.6e5 GeV. Because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so 2.6e8 MeV / 1e3 MeV/GeV = 2.6e5 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that would be the energy where the process becomes possible. But wait, the question is about the energy where the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps this is the threshold energy, and above this, the interaction becomes significant, limiting the lifetime.

Wait, but the cross-section is inversely proportional to Eγ * E_cmb. So for Eγ much larger than the threshold, the cross-section decreases, but the interaction rate depends on the density of CMB photons as well.

The mean free path λ is given by 1/(n σ), where n is the number density of the target photons. So, the interaction rate is higher when the cross-section is higher and when there are more targets.

So, the mean free path would be λ = 1/(n σ). The lifetime is limited when the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, or the Hubble length. But since the CMB is everywhere, the gamma-rays would interact quickly if λ is small.

Alternatively, the optical depth τ is n σ λ, which should be about 1 for the process to be significant. So, when τ ≈ 1, the gamma-ray would be absorbed on average once.

So, the optical depth is τ = n σ λ. But wait, in cosmology, the universe's size is roughly the Hubble length, but for the photon's lifetime, it's about how quickly it can interact.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the interaction rate. The interaction probability per unit length is n σ. So the time until interaction is t ≈ 1/(n σ v), where v is the velocity (which for gamma-rays is c).

So, lifetime τ = 1/(n σ c).

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, the mean lifetime is τ = 1/(n σ c), since the gamma-ray is moving at speed c.

So, to compute this, I'd need to find n, the number density of CMB photons, and σ, the cross-section.

But wait, perhaps there's a standard approach to this problem. I think the energy where the gamma-ray's mean free path equals the age of the universe is when the process becomes significant. So, the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited when the interaction probability is high enough that the gamma-ray cannot travel far.

Let me get the number density of CMB photons. The CMB has a temperature T, and the number density is n ≈ 1e8 photons/cm³ or something like that. Wait, more accurately, the number density of CMB photons is n = (2ζ(3)/π²) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3). Using T ≈ 2.7 K.

But perhaps I can find it as n ≈ 1e8 photons/m^3. Wait, more precisely, the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³, which is about 4.11e6 photons per m³ (since 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m³, so 411 / 1e-6 = 4.11e8 photons/m³). Wait, no, that would be a huge number. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the CMB energy density is about 1e-4 erg/cm³. The energy density u of CMB is given by u = (8 π/15) (k_B T)^4 / (h c)^3. For T=2.7 K, u ≈ 1e-4 erg/cm³.

But the number density n is u / (average photon energy). The average photon energy for a blackbody is 2.7 k_B T. So, n = u / (2.7 k_B T).

So, let's compute this.

First, constants:

k_B = 1.38e-16 erg/K.

h = 6.626e-27 erg s.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

T = 2.7 K.

Compute u: u = (8 π /15) (k_B T)^4 / (h c)^3.

Let me compute (k_B T)^4:

k_B T = 1.38e-16 erg/K * 2.7 K ≈ 3.726e-16 erg.

(k_B T)^4 ≈ (3.726e-16)^4 ≈ (3.726)^4 * (1e-16)^4 ≈ 180 * 1e-64 erg^4.

Wait, 3.726^4 is approximately (3.7)^4 = 3.7 *3.7=13.69, 13.69 *3.7≈50.65, 50.65 *3.7≈187.4. So approx 1.87e2.

So (k_B T)^4 ≈ 1.87e2 * (1e-64) erg^4.

Denominator (h c)^3: h=6.626e-27 erg s, c=3e10 cm/s.

h c = 6.626e-27 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-16 erg cm.

(h c)^3 = (1.9878e-16)^3 ≈ (2e-16)^3 = 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So u = (8 π /15) * (1.87e2 *1e-64 erg^4) ) / (8e-48 erg^3 cm^3)

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Compute numerator: (8 π /15) * (k_B T)^4 = (8 *3.1416 /15) * (3.726e-16)^4.

But (3.726e-16)^4 = (3.726)^4 * (1e-16)^4 = ~ 180 * 1e-64 = 1.8e-62 erg^4.

So (8 π /15) * 1.8e-62 = (approx 1.6755) *1.8e-62 ≈ 3.016e-62 erg^4.

Denominator: (h c)^3 = (6.626e-27 erg s * 3e10 cm/s )^3 = (1.9878e-16 erg cm )^3 = approx (2e-16)^3 = 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So u = (3.016e-62 erg^4) / (8e-48 erg^3 cm^3) ) = (3.016e-62 / 8e-48 ) erg/cm^3.

Which is 3.016e-62 /8e-48 = (3.016 /8 ) * 1e-14 = 0.377 *1e-14 = 3.77e-15 erg/cm³.

Wait, but I know that the CMB energy density is about 1e-4 erg/cm³, so this calculation gives a much lower value. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for u. The correct formula for the energy density of a photon gas is u = (8 π/15) (k_B T)^4/(h c)^3. So let's compute each term again.

Compute (k_B T)^4 in erg^4:

k_B = 1.38e-16 erg/K.

T=2.7 K → k_B T = 1.38e-16 *2.7 ≈ 3.726e-16 erg.

(k_B T)^4 = (3.726e-16)^4 = (3.726)^4 * (1e-16)^4 ≈ 180 * 1e-64 = 1.8e-62 erg^4.

Denominator (h c)^3:

h=6.626e-27 erg s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

h*c = 6.626e-27 *3e10 = 1.9878e-16 erg cm.

(h c)^3 = (1.9878e-16)^3 ≈ (2e-16)^3 = 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So u = (8π/15) * (1.8e-62 erg^4) / (8e-48 erg^3 cm^3) )

Wait, the denominator is 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So the numerator is 8 π/15 * 1.8e-62.

8π/15 ≈ (25.1327)/15 ≈ 1.6755.

So 1.6755 * 1.8e-62 ≈ 3.016e-62.

Then, u = 3.016e-62 / 8e-48 = (3.016/8 ) *1e-14 → 0.377 *1e-14 = 3.77e-15 erg/cm³.

But this is way too low. I must have made a mistake. The correct energy density should be around 1e-4 erg/cm³. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents or the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is u = (8 π/15) (k_B T)^4/(h^3 c^3) → but wait, (h c)^3 would be (h)^3 (c)^3. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part with correct exponents.

Compute (k_B T)^4:

k_B = 1.38e-16 erg/K.

T=2.7 K → k_B T = 1.38e-16 * 2.7 ≈ 3.726e-16 erg.

(k_B T)^4 = (3.726e-16)^4 = (3.726)^4 * (1e-16)^4 = 180 * 1e-64 = 1.8e-62 erg^4.

Denominator h^3 c^3:

h = 6.626e-27 erg s.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

h^3 = (6.626e-27)^3 ≈ 2.908e-80 (erg s)^3.

c^3 = (3e10)^3 = 2.7e30 cm^3.

h^3 c^3 = 2.908e-80 * 2.7e30 = approx 7.85e-50 erg^3 s^3 cm^3.

Wait, but the denominator is (h c)^3, which is (6.626e-27 erg s *3e10 cm/s )^3 = (1.9878e-16 erg cm )^3 = (1.9878e-16)^3 erg^3 cm^3.

Which is approximately (2e-16)^3 = 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So denominator is 8e-48 erg^3 cm^3.

So u = (8π/15) * (1.8e-62 erg^4) / (8e-48 erg^3 cm^3) )

Which is (8π/15 * 1.8e-62) / 8e-48 erg/cm^3.

Simplify:

(8π/15) *1.8e-62 → 8π is about 25.1327. 25.1327/15 ≈ 1.6755. 1.6755 *1.8e-62 ≈ (3.016e-62).

Divided by 8e-48: 3.016e-62 /8e-48 = (3.016/8 ) * 1e-14 → 0.377 *1e-14 → 3.77e-15 erg/cm^3.

But as I said, that's way too low. Why is this? Maybe I missed a factor of 1e6 somewhere because of units. Let me check.

Wait, the formula for u is (8π/15)(k_B T)^4/(h c)^3. But I'm using ergs, cm, seconds. Oh wait, the denominator is (h c)^3, which is correct in erg cm. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy density in terms of temperature.

Alternatively, let me use a known value. The CMB energy density is about 1e-4 erg/cm³. So I'll accept that and proceed. So n = u / (average photon energy).

The average photon energy for a blackbody is (2.703 k_B T), approximately. So with T=2.7 K,

average E_photon = 2.703 * 1.38e-16 erg/K * 2.7 K ≈ 2.703 * 3.726e-16 ≈ 1.007e-15 erg.

So n = u / E_photon = (1e-4 erg/cm³) / (1e-15 erg) ) = 1e11 photons/cm³. Wait, 1e-4 /1e-15 is 1e11. That's 1e11 photons per cubic cm, which is 1e17 photons per cubic meter. That's a lot, but perhaps correct.

So n ≈ 1e11 photons/cm³. Let's convert that to m³: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So 1e11 photons/cm³ is 1e11 / 1e-6 m³ = 1e17 photons/m³.

Now, back to the cross-section. The cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- is given by σ ≈ (8 π α² m_e²) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, but earlier I thought about the cross-section scaling as σ ≈ (3 α² m_e²) / (4 E1 E2), which is another way of writing it.

Alternatively, the cross-section for photon-photon interactions is σ = (8 π α² m_e²) / (3 (E1 E2)) ) * something. Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. But I don't have that luxury here, so I need to proceed.

I think the cross-section is approximately σ ≈ (4 π α^2 m_e^2) / (3 E1 E2). Wait, let me confirm. The cross-section for two photons of energy E1 and E2 (with E1 >> m_e, E2 >> m_e) is σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e²)/(3 E1 E2). So that's the formula I'll use.

So σ = (4 π α² m_e²) / (3 E1 E2).

But in our case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy (Eγ) and E2 is the CMB photon energy (E_cmb).

So σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e²) / (3 Eγ E_cmb).

Now, the interaction rate Γ is given by Γ = n σ c, where c is the speed of light (since the gamma-ray is moving at c, and the probability per unit volume is n σ).

So Γ = n σ c = n [ (4 π α² m_e²)/(3 Eγ E_cmb) ) ] c.

The lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ: τ = 1/Γ = (3 Eγ E_cmb )/(4 π α² m_e² n c ).

We want to find the gamma-ray energy Eγ where the lifetime τ is comparable to the age of the universe. The age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4.3e17 seconds.

So set τ ≈ age of universe → (3 Eγ E_cmb )/(4 π α² m_e² n c ) ≈ 4.3e17 s.

Now, plug in the numbers.

Constants:

- α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.
- m_e = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e9 eV (wait, no, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV).
Wait, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². So m_e in eV is 511,000 eV (since 1 MeV = 1e6 eV).

But let's compute α^2: (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

m_e^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Wait, E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV.

n is 1e17 photons/m³.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Now, let's compute the denominator and numerator.

Denominator: 4 π α^2 m_e^2 n c.

Compute each term:

4 π ≈ 12.566.

α² ≈ 5.3e-5.

m_e^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV².

n = 1e17 photons/m³.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So denominator D = 12.566 * 5.3e-5 * 2.61e11 * 1e17 * 3e8.

Let me compute each multiplication step:

12.566 *5.3e-5 ≈ 6.659e-4.

6.659e-4 *2.61e11 ≈ 1.738e8.

1.738e8 *1e17 = 1.738e25.

1.738e25 *3e8 = 5.214e33.

So D ≈ 5.214e33.

Numerator N = 3 * Eγ * E_cmb.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So N = 3 * Eγ * 1e-3 = 3e-3 Eγ.

So the equation is:

(3e-3 Eγ) / (5.214e33) ) ≈ 4.3e17 s.

Solving for Eγ:

Egamma ≈ (4.3e17 s) * (5.214e33) / (3e-3) )

Compute the factors:

4.3e17 *5.214e33 = (4.3 *5.214) e(17+33) = 22.42e50 = 2.242e51.

Divide by 3e-3: 2.242e51 /3e-3 = (2.242 /3 )e54 ≈ 0.747e54 = 7.47e53 eV.

Wait, but wait, the units have to make sense. Because Egamma is in eV, and the other terms are in eV and s.

Wait, I think I might have made an error in units. Let me recompute the equation properly.

Wait, the equation is:

(3 * Eγ (eV) * E_cmb (eV) ) / (4 π α² m_e² (eV^2) * n (photons/m³) * c (m/s)) ) ) = age (seconds).

Wait, Egamma and E_cmb in eV, so 3 Egamma E_cmb has units eV^2.

m_e^2 is in eV^2.

n is photons/m³.

c is m/s.

So the denominator has units:

(4 π α² m_e^2) → eV^2.

n → photons/m³. Since each photon has eV, the unit for energy density is eV/m³.

c → m/s.

So putting it all together, the denominator is eV^2 * (eV/m³) * m/s = (eV^3) / (m^3 s).

The numerator is 3 Egamma E_cmb → eV^2.

So the left side has units (eV^2) / (eV^3/(m^3 s)) ) = (m^3 s) / eV.

Wait, but the RHS is in seconds. So perhaps I have a mistake in units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything in SI units.

But maybe I'm complicating things. Let me proceed numerically.

Egamma ≈ (age * D) / N.

Wait, from the equation:

(3 Egamma E_cmb) / (4 π α^2 m_e^2 n c) ) = age.

So,

Egamma = [ age * 4 π α^2 m_e^2 n c ] / (3 E_cmb )

Plugging the numbers:

age =4.3e17 s.

α^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

n = 1e17 photons/m³.

c =3e8 m/s.

E_cmb =1e-3 eV.

So,

Egamma = [ 4.3e17 * 12.566 *5.3e-5 * 2.61e11 * 1e17 *3e8 ] / (3 * 1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *12.566 ≈ 5.408e18.

5.408e18 *5.3e-5 →5.408e18 *5.3e-5 =5.408 *5.3e13 → about 28.66e13 = 2.866e14.

2.866e14 *2.61e11 → 2.866e14 *2.61e11 = 7.47e25.

7.47e25 *1e17 →7.47e42.

7.47e42 *3e8 →2.241e50.

Denominator: 3e-3.

So Egamma ≈ 2.241e50 / 3e-3 → 7.47e52 eV.

Wait, but 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 7.47e52 eV = 7.47e43 GeV.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. The options are up to 4e5 GeV. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the cross-section formula. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the interaction length. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ). The gamma-ray is absorbed when λ ~ age of universe / (gamma's speed). So, the condition is λ ≈ c * age.

So, λ ≈ 1/(n σ) ≈ c * age.

So,

1/(n σ) ≈ c * age → σ ≈ 1/(n c age ).

But also, σ = (4 π α² m_e²)/(3 Eγ E_cmb).

So,

(4 π α² m_e²) / (3 Eγ E_cmb ) ≈ 1/(n c age).

Solving for Egamma:

Egamma ≈ (4 π α² m_e^2 )/(3 E_cmb n c age )

So Egamma = (4 π α² m_e^2 )/(3 E_cmb n c age )

Plugging in numbers:

4 π ≈12.566.

alpha^2= (1/137)^2≈5.3e-5.

m_e^2= (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

E_cmb=1e-3 eV.

n=1e17 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

age=4.3e17 s.

So,

Egamma = (12.566 *5.3e-5 *2.61e11) / (3 *1e-3 *1e17 *3e8 *4.3e17 )

Compute numerator:

12.566 *5.3e-5 ≈6.66e-4.

6.66e-4 *2.61e11 ≈1.738e8.

Denominator:

3 *1e-3 =3e-3.

3e-3 *1e17 =3e14.

3e14 *3e8=9e22.

9e22 *4.3e17=3.87e40.

So Egamma=1.738e8 / 3.87e40 =4.49e-33 eV.

Wait, that's way too low. That can't be right. So I must have confused the formula somehow.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard relation. I remember that the critical energy where the lifetime is limited by CMB interactions is given by E_crit ≈ 1.6e5 GeV * (1e-3 eV / E_cmb ) * (n / n0), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the photon density and cross-section. Another approach: The optical depth τ is n σ λ. For λ being the age of the universe, τ ≈ 1, so τ = n σ c t ≈ 1.

So,

n σ c t ≈1 → σ ≈ 1/(n c t )

But σ = (something) / (Egamma E_cmb )

So,

(something) / (Egamma E_cmb ) = 1/(n c t )

→ Egamma ≈ (something * n c t ) / E_cmb.

What's 'something'? It's (4 π alpha^2 m_e^2 ) /3.

So,

Egamma = (4 π alpha^2 m_e² ) * n c t / (3 E_cmb )

Putting the numbers:

4 π ≈12.566.

alpha^2=5.3e-5.

m_e^2=2.61e11 eV².

n=1e17 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

t=4.3e17 s.

E_cmb=1e-3 eV.

Egamma = (12.566 *5.3e-5 *2.61e11 *1e17 *3e8 *4.3e17 ) / (3 *1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

12.566 *5.3e-5 ≈6.66e-4.

6.66e-4 *2.61e11 ≈1.738e8.

1.738e8 *1e17 =1.738e25.

1.738e25 *3e8=5.214e33.

5.214e33 *4.3e17=2.242e51.

Denominator=3e-3.

So Egamma=2.242e51 /3e-3=7.47e53 eV.

Wait, that's 7.47e53 eV. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 7.47e53 eV =7.47e44 GeV. That can't be right, because the options are much smaller. 

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the exponent somewhere. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, in the numerator: 12.566 *5.3e-5 =6.66e-4.

6.66e-4 *2.61e11 = (6.66 *2.61) e( -4 +11 )= 17.38 e7 =1.738e8.

1.738e8 *1e17 →1.738e25.

1.738e25 *3e8 =5.214e33.

5.214e33 *4.3e17 =5.214 *4.3 =22.42, so 22.42e50 =2.242e51.

Denominator:3e-3.

So Egamma=2.242e51 /3e-3 = (2.242/3) *1e54 ≈0.747e54 =7.47e53 eV.

Wait, 7.47e53 eV is way too big. The options are in 1e5 GeV, which is 1e14 eV. So I'm way off. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent when multiplying 4.3e17.

Wait, 5.214e33 *4.3e17 =5.214 *4.3 =22.42, exponents 33+17=50 → 22.42e50 = 2.242e51. That's correct.

So Egamma=2.242e51 /3e-3 =7.47e53 eV.

Which is 7.47e53 eV =7.47e44 GeV. That's way beyond any of the options. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait a second. Maybe I should use Egamma * E_cmb ≈ m_e^2. Earlier, when I thought about the threshold, I found Egamma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4 ) / E_cmb.

Wait, let's compute that.

m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV → m_e² c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2 * c^2 → but actually, it's (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Egamma = (m_e^2 c^4 ) / E_cmb = (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV )= 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, that's option C: 2.6*1e5 GeV.

But earlier, when I went through the detailed calculation, I got Egamma around 7.4e53 eV, which is 7e44 GeV, which can't be right.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the threshold energy where Egamma * E_cmb = (m_e c^2)^2, leading to Egamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

So Egamma = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) → 0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 *1e12 eV² = 0.261 *1e12 =2.61e11 eV².

Divide by E_cmb=1e-3 eV → 2.61e11 /1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Which is exactly option C.

So why did the previous detailed calculation give such a high value? Because I probably made a mistake in the formula.

Ah, I think I confused the cross-section formula. The cross-section for γγ → e+e- when Eγ and E_cmb are much larger than m_e is σ ≈ (4 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/( Eγ E_cmb ), but the process becomes significant when Eγ * E_cmb ≈ m_e^2 c^4, which is the threshold for pair production.

So the critical energy is Egamma = (m_e c^2 )^2 / E_cmb.

So the answer should be option C, 2.6e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays for which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by the interaction process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process involves a high-energy gamma-ray ($\gamma$) interacting with a low-energy CMB photon ($\gamma$) to produce an electron-positron pair. The critical energy of the gamma-ray is determined by the threshold condition for pair production, which requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least $2m_e c^2$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Threshold Condition**:  
   The invariant mass squared of the photon-photon system is given by $s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$, where $E_\gamma$ is the gamma-ray energy and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ is the CMB photon energy. At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$. Substituting, we find:  
   \[
   E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq m_e^2 c^4
   \]  
   Solving for $E_\gamma$, we get:  
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{m_e^2 c^4}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Constants**:  
   - $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$  
   - $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ (average photon energy of the CMB)  

3. **Calculation**:  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV:  
   \[
   E_\gamma = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The critical energy of the gamma-ray, above which its lifetime is limited by the interaction with CMB photons, is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This matches option C.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (9.5 × 10⁴ GeV)**: Too low; the gamma-ray energy must exceed the threshold derived above for the interaction to occur.  
- **Option B (1.8 × 10⁵ GeV)**: Still too low; does not satisfy the threshold condition.  
- **Option C (2.6 × 10⁵ GeV)**: Matches the calculated threshold energy and is correct.  
- **Option D (3.9 × 10⁵ GeV)**: Higher than the threshold energy, but unnecessary for the problem.

### Final Answer:
The energy of gamma-rays for which their lifetimes are limited by the interaction with CMB photons is **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.

**Answer: C**
