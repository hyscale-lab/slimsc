Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different propenyl or butenyl acetates, varying in cis or trans configurations.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and chemical shifts can tell us a lot about the structure, especially for double bonds and substituents.

First, looking at the options: all are acetates, so they have an acetate ester group. The substituents are propenyl or butenyl groups, either cis or trans. So the structure is likely something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc or CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but with stereochemistry.

Wait, but the substituents would be on the double bond. Let me think about each option's structure.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, propenyl has three carbons, like CH2=CH2-CH2-OAc? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, right? But wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group, and the substituents on either side would be CH2 and CH2-OAc. But in cis, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be on the same side. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the groups attached to either side are CH2 (from CH2=) and CHCH2-OAc (from CH2-). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, for butenyl acetate, the structure is longer. Like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or similar, but again with cis or trans.

Wait, the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so probably aromatic protons. But wait, acetates don't have benzene rings unless the substituent has one. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that's not introducing any aromatic protons. Hmm. Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a single proton. So maybe it's an allylic proton or part of a double bond. But that's a high shiftâ€”maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an electronegative group.

Looking at the data again, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling
