Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different enol acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl acetates. Hmm, I remember that the structure of these compounds will affect the NMR signals, especially the splitting and the integration.

Looking at the NMR data given: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

First, I think about what each of these signals could represent. The 2.1 ppm singlet for 3H is probably the acetate group's methyl. Acetates usually have a singlet around there because the methyl is attached to the oxygen and has no neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to something else. Since the integration is 3H, it's likely a CH3 group connected to a carbon with two substituents or maybe a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. If it's a double, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to something else. But wait, 3H as a doublet could mean that it's a CH3 group attached to a CH which is next to another CH. Like in an allylic position or maybe in a propenyl group.

The 5.5 ppm region is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit tricky. Let me think. In an acetylenic compound, protons would show up around higher ppm, but this is 5.5, which is more like a vinyl proton. So, maybe it's a propenyl group or a butenyl group.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. Oh, I remember that when two protons are on adjacent carbons (like in a trans configuration), the coupling can be around 16 Hz. In a cis configuration, the coupling is usually smaller, like around 10 Hz or so. So this J=16 suggests a trans arrangement.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. For propenyl and butenyl groups. Let's consider the possible structures.

Propenyl acetate would have the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing up. No, wait, the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc for propenyl acetate. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl acetate is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? Or is it OAc-O-CH2-C=CH2? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the general formula for propenyl acetate is (propenyl) acetate, which would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2... no, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- so the structure is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? No, wait, wait. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, that would be the structure of allyl acetate, maybe? Because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Let me think: propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Oh wait, but that would be allyl acetate, not propenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the N
