Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "brighter than 17 mag" so that's V <17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can detect stars up to V=17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning V <16.

So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V < 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star's V is 15, both can detect. But if it's 16.5, HIRES can't, but ESPRESSO can.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star. Because some of them give absolute magnitudes, others give apparent, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute magnitude M = 15.5, distance d = 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log(1)=0. So m = 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Since 15.5 <16, HIRES can see it. Also 15.5 <17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait: Star1's given as absolute magnitude, so I have to calculate the apparent. But the distance is 10 pc, so m = M. So yes, 15.5. So Star1 is acceptable.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5. For HIRES, which needs m <16, 16.5 is too faint. HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5 mag, but wait, no. Wait, Star3's given: apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction. E(B-V)=0.6. The problem says that the total absorption in V is E(B-V) * 3.1. So extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = m_observed - A_V. So m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. Wait, wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So if a star has extinction, the observed magnitude is higher
