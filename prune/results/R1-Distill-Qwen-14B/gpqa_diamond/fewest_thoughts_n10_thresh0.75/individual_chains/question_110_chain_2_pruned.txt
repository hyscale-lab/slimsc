Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that two spectrographs, ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck, can detect certain stars. The key is figuring out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both instruments. The question provides information about each star's apparent magnitude or absolute magnitude, their distances, and in some cases, extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their observed brightness.

Wait, I remember that apparent magnitude is what matters for detection because it's how bright the star appears from Earth. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 parsecs away. So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude because that's what determines if the spectrographs can see them.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So any star with V <17 is observable. HIRES can observe brighter than 16, so V <16 is needed. So a star must have V <17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and V <16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag <=17 can be observed. So if it's brighter than 17 (like 16) it can be seen. Similarly, HIRES can see up to 16, so if a star is brighter than 16 (like 15) it's visible to HIRES. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's 16 or higher, HIRES can't see it, and if it's 17 or higher, ESPRESSO can't see it unless it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, the problem says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be
