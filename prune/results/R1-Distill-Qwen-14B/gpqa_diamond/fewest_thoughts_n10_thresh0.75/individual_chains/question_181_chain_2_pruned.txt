Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific branch of reactions stops. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main branches are I, II, and III, right? So pp-I is the dominant one, then II, and III is a minor one but still contributes.

Neutrinos are produced in these reactions. Specifically, the pp-I and pp-II branches produce neutrinos through the beta decay steps. In the pp-III branch, I think it's where a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton to make something else, and that process releases neutrinos too. Oh wait, right, pp-III is the only one that emits neutrinos with higher energies because of the higher masses involved. So the pp-III neutrinos have higher energies compared to the others.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? The Earth receives neutrinos from all these processes. If pp-III stops, the flux from that particular source would drop. But other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still running, so their neutrinos are still coming through.

The question is about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the flux in each band is affected.

Wait, I recall that the pp-III neutrinos have higher energies. Let me think about their energy distribution. The neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy, so they'd be in the band 800-900 keV or higher. So when pp-III stops, that band (band 2) would lose a significant portion of its neutrinos because the pp-III neutrinos are in that higher range.

The lower band, 700-800 keV, mainly comes from the other branches, right? Because pp-I and pp-II produce lower-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III is stopped, the flux in band 1 wouldn't change much, but band 2 would lose a lot of its neutrinos.

So the flux in band 1 was F1, and band 2 was F2. If pp-III was contributing a significant part of F2, then after stopping, F2_new = F2 (from other sources) minus the pp-III contribution. Wait, but wait, do other sources contribute much to band 2?

I think the pp-III is the main source for the higher energy neutrinos. So before the stoppage, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) was mostly from pp-III. Let's say originally, F2 was dominated by pp-III. So when pp-III stops, F2 drops a lot. 

So the ratio F1/F2 would change. Originally, maybe F1 was smaller than F2 because pp-III contributed a lot to F2. But after pp-III stops, F2 becomes much smaller.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's model the fluxes.

Assume before stopping, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is F1 = F_ppI + F_ppII + F_ppIII_low, where ppIII_low is the part of ppIII that falls into this band. Similarly, F2 (800-900) is F_ppI_high + F_ppII_high + F_ppIII.

But wait, I think the ppI and ppII don't produce the same high-energy neutrinos as ppIII. So maybe the higher bands are mostly from ppIII. So if ppIII stops, F2 drops significantly.

So before the stoppage, F2 was dominated by ppIII. After stopping, F2_new â‰ˆ F_ppI_high + F_ppII_high. But wait, do ppI and ppII contribute much to the 800-900 keV band? I think their neutrinos are lower, so their contribution to F2 is minimal. So when ppIII stops, F2_new drops to almost zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The time frame here is 8.5 minutes. The Sun's core is about 8 light minutes away, so the neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So if the ppIII stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would stop arriving after that time. So any neutrinos emitted before that would still be on their way.

Wait, no. Neutrinos are produced continuously. If the process stops 8.5 minutes ago, then the flux of neutrinos from that process would drop to zero, and the neutrinos in transit would continue to arrive for a while. But the question is about the current flux. So the flux from ppIII is zero now,
