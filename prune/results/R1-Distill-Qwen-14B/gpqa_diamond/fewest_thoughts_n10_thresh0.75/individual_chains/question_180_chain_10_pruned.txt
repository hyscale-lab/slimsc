Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, I know that e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 2 times that. But wait, the particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions from their motion or anything like that. They're just point charges.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So point P is where one charge is fixed, and the others are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. So I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because the system's energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait. Since the system is isolated, and the charges are fixed in position (except for the 13th which is fixed at P), the potential energy would be the sum of the potentials due to each pair.

But wait a second: How exactly are the 12 charges arranged around P? Are they all at the same point or spread out? Because if they're all at the same point 2 meters from P, that would cause a lot of repulsion. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are each at different points, all lying on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, like whether they form a regular dodecagon or something. Hmm, but for the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement doesn't matter because we're just considering the potential between the charges regardless of their positions relative to each other. Wait, no, because the potential energy of the system would include the energy between all pairs. But since the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe their mutual repulsion contributes to the total energy. But wait, the problem might simplify things by considering that the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances might comp
