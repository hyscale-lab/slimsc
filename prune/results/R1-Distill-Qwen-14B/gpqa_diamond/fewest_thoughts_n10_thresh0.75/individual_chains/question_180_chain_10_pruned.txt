Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just focusing on potential energy, I think. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, and it's correct to three decimal places. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I'm guessing this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since the system is isolated and the charges are fixed in certain positions, the only energy we're considering is the electrostatic potential energy between the charges.

Wait, the key here is to find the potential energy of the system. Since the charges are all the same and placed in a certain configuration, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them up.

Let me break it down. There are 13 charges, with 12 at 2 meters from P and one at P. So, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from it. But wait, the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, so each of them is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge at P.

But wait, but each of the 12 charges is also at some distance from each other. Hmm, do I need to consider the potential energy between all pairs? Because in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Right, the formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since all the particles are identical, each with charge 2e, I can represent each charge as q = 2e. So, the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

But wait, how many pairs are there? For n charges
