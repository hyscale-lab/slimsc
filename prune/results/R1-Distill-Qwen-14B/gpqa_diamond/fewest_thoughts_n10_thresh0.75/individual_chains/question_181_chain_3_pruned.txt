Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a specific part of the Sun's fusion process stops. Hmm, let's think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's processes happen over such a long timescale, but neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, right? So 8.5 minutes is the time it takes for light to travel from the core to the surface. Oh, right, because the Sun's core is where fusion happens, and the light takes about that time to get out. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos we're detecting now would have been emitted before the change because the neutrinos are already on their way. Or wait, noâ€”if the pp-III stops, the neutrino production would change, but the neutrinos from the core take about 8.5 minutes to reach the surface and then another 8 light minutes to reach Earth. Wait, actually, neutrinos are emitted from the core and take about 8-9 minutes to reach Earth. So if the process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes wouldn't have reached Earth yet. So the neutrinos we detect now would still be from the previous processes. Hmm, maybe that's a detail that's complicating things, but perhaps the question is more about the production rates.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands. So, it's about how the production of neutrinos in different energy ranges changes when the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of solar energy. The pp-III branch is a specific part of this chain. Let me recall: the proton-proton chain has different branches. The dominant one is the pp-I branch, where two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton adds to make tritium, which then decays into helium-3 and a positron. The pp-II branch is a minor part where the helium-3 from pp-I combines with another helium-3 to make helium-4. Then there's pp-III, which I think involves processes where maybe three protons fuse or something, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

But regardless, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two bands when the pp-III branch stops. So, the pp-III branch must contribute to certain neutrino energies.

Neutrinos are produced in several processes in the Sun. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, the pp chain, and the CNO cycle. But the Sun is mostly using the pp chain, so the CNO isn't as significant. The dominant neutrinos are from the pp chain. 

In the pp chain, the main neutrinos come from two processes: the decay of tritium (which produces electron neutrinos), and the so-called "other" neutrinos, like from the decay of beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle. Wait, no, more accurately, the neutrinos from the Sun are mainly from the beta decay in the pp chain. For the pp-I branch, the key reaction is the fusion of two protons producing
