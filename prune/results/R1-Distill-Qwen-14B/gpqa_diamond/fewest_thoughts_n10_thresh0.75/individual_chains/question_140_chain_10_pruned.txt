Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the reaction between X and Y. It's violent, releases gas W, and a precipitate G forms. Let's think about common violent reactions. Maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid? Or perhaps a reaction that produces hydrogen gas, like metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen.

Wait, gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has one proton and zero neutrons, so that's not it. Helium has two of each, but that's a noble gas. Then maybe D2 (deuterium?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2 or something else, but wait, CO2 has 12 neutrons and 14 protons... no. Wait, no, carbon has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in CO2. Wait, maybe W is something like CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 8 neutrons in the molecule, but total would be 6+8=14, but wait, each molecule of CH4 has 6p, 8n. Oh wait, the molecule's total. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, per molecule, total protons and total neutrons are equal. So for example, H2O has 10 protons (O=8, H=1 each) and 10 neutrons (O has 8, H has 0). Oh wait, H2O: 8 (O) + 1 (H) + 1
