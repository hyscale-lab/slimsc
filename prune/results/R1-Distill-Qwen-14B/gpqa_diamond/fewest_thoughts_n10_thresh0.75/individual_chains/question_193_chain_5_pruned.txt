Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, and the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various power laws, so I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and distance.

Wait, first, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but in parsecs, I think. So plx = 1/d. Oh wait, no, no, I think it's the other way around. Parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is d = 1 / plx. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars, N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since d = 1/plx, that would mean plx = 1/d. Substituting that into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as (d)^5, so N ∝ d^5. Oh, but wait, wait. N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So
