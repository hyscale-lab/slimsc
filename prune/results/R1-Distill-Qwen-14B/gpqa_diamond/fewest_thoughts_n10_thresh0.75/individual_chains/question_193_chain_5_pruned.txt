Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm, right. Parallax is a measure of distance—closer stars have larger parallax values, and more distant stars have smaller ones.

I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance (r) by the formula plx = 1/r, but wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So r is inversely proportional to plx. So if plx is small, r is large. Got it.

Now, the problem says that the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But we need to find how N changes with distance r. So let's express N in terms of r.

Since plx = 1/r, then plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Let's plug that into the equation for N.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = 1/( (k/r)^5 ) = r^5 / k^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the algebra.

Wait, plx is 1/r. So if I have (plx)^5, it's (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. Therefore, 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So does that mean the differential number of stars, like dN/dr? Or is it about the number in a shell of radius r to r+dr?

Hmm, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a spherical shell (like between r and r+dr) would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the volume element. Wait,
