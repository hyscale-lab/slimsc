Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's take a deep breath and tackle it step by step.

The problem is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. We're given the mass of Fe(OH)3 as 0.1 grams and the total volume of the solution as 100 cm³. We need to find two things: the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve it, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a volume and pH value.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with in terms of moles. So, I'll start by calculating the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

The formula is Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So, each OH group contributes 17 g/mol. Since there are three OH groups, that's 3 *17=51 g/mol. So the total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Let me double-check that: 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16+1) (for each OH) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85. Yep, that's right.

Now, the mass given is 0.1 grams. So moles = mass / molar mass. Moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, about 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it dissolves in a strong acid, the reaction should be an acid-base neutralization. So the strong acid (like HCl) will donate H+ ions, which will react with the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3.

The reaction equation should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to dissolve it.

So, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. Let's compute that: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles of H+.

Wait, but the acid is monobasic and strong. So the molarity of the acid is 0.1 M. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So the acid's concentration is 0.1 mol per liter, which is 0.1 M.

We need to find the volume of this acid that provides at least 0.002808 moles of H+. The formula is moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, so looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is close. And that's the first part of the question.

Wait a second, but wait. What about the stoichiometry again? Let me double-check. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each can react with one H+ from
