Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have a system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave isn't allowed.

First, I remember that the parity of the initial and final states must be conserved because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions, I think. So the parity of the initial state multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle X should equal the parity of the final state.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me recall what that means. The notation is (2S+1)LJ. So for 1S0, S=0 because 2*0+1=1. L is S, which is 0, so the orbital angular momentum is 0. And J is 0. So the initial state has parity (-1)^L. Since L=0, parity is 1.

Now, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Let's denote its angular momentum as l, so its parity is (-1)^l. Wait, but in the options, the emitted particles are different: p, s, etc. Like in option A, it's a p meson? Or maybe it's a different notation. Oh, wait, the problem says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So 'p' means l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, usually l=0 is s, 1 is p, 2 is d, 3 is f. So the emitted X's angular momentum state is given by l, so in the options, the letters correspond to l.

So for parity conservation, initial parity * parity of X = final parity. The initial parity is 1. The parity of X is (-1)^l. The final state's parity is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission.

So, 1 * (-1)^l = (-1)^{L_final}. That gives (-1)^l = (-1)^{L_final} → l ≡ L_final mod 2. So L_final must have the same parity as l.

Next, the Pauli condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. And T(NN) is given as 0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0, so S_initial is 0 (since the state is S=0). When the two nucleons emit a particle, their total
