Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions, given by the Lagrangian term. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. Because for a decay to be allowed, the boson's mass needs to be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since you're creating a pair, so each fermion takes some energy).

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think that's a Yukawa interaction term. The X field is coupling to fermions. So the interaction is between X and each fermion species f. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So for each fermion f, if 2*m_f <= m_X, that decay is allowed.

Which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV / 2 is 3 GeV)?

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Up quark is about 2-5 MeV, down quark similar. Then strange is around 100 MeV. Then the charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. Top is way too heavy, around 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon about 0.1 GeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are super light, but their masses are negligible, so maybe the problem ignores them.

So let's list all the possible fermions:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t.

Leptons: e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles.

So for each fermion pair, the mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Charm quark is ~1.5 GeV. So 2*m_c is about 3 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar. Because 6 GeV is exactly twice of 3 GeV, so that's allowed.

Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. Wait, 2*m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So any options that include b quarks (like option A and D) are out?

Wait, let me double-check. Mass of X is 6 GeV. To produce a pair of b quarks, each would
