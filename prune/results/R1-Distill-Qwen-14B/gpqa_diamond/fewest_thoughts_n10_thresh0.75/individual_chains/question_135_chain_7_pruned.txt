Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, I think this describes an interaction between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, so X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is important because the decay products need to have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Otherwise, the decay wouldn't be possible.

Let me think: each decay product is a pair of particles, like b bbar or c cbar. The mass of each fermion pair is 2 times the mass of the fermion, because you have a particle and an antiparticle. So, for example, a bottom quark pair would have a mass of 2 * m_b. What's the mass of a bottom quark? I remember that the top quark is the heaviest, about 173 GeV, but the bottom is much lighter. I think the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV. Wait, but the X is 6 GeV. That's less than 9, so X can't decay into b bbar because that would require 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So b bbar is not allowed. So any option that includes b quarks is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the quark masses. Let me think again. I think the masses (approximate) are:

- Up and down: about 2-5 MeV each, so up quark is lighter.
- Strange: around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm: about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom: 4.5 GeV
- Top: 173 GeV

So X has
