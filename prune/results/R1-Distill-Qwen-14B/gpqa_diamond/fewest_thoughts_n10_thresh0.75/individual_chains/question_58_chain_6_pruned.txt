Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, first what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”that is, infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities temporarily, and then you remove them later with renormalization.

So the question is which of these theories doesn't need regularization, meaning it doesn't have these problematic infinities, or perhaps handles them without needing this technique.

Looking at the options:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, that's the non-quantum version of electromagnetism. Classical theories don't usually have the same kinds of divergences that quantum theories do because they don't involve the same renormalization issues. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you can have problems like the infinite self-energy of a charge, but I think those are handled differently. Or maybe in the classical case, you don't need regularization because you're not doing perturbative calculations. Alternatively, since regularization is a quantum field theory tool, classical theories might not require it.

Wait a minute, but Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is option C. QED is a quantum field theory, and I remember that QED does require renormalization because of the divergences in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is option B. QCD deals with the strong force and involves things like asymptotic freedom. I think QCD does require regularization too, especially when dealing with things like the beta function and renormalization group equations. But wait, because of asymptotic freedom, maybe the divergences are less severe at high energies? Or perhaps it's still necessary. Regularization is a step in the process regardless; even if the theory is asymptotically free, you still need to handle divergences during calculations.

Superstring Theory is option A. String theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and is finite, meaning it doesn't have the same divergences as in quantum field theories. Oh, right! I've heard that string theories don't require renormalization because they don't have the same loop divergences as in, say, QED or QCD. So maybe they don't need regularization either. But wait, could it be that string theory requires some form of regularization, or does it naturally avoid it?

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory is already finite, it wouldn't need regularization. But wait, isn't regularization a part of the process to handle divergences? If a theory doesn't have divergences, then you don't need regularization. So which of these theories is known to be finite?

I remember that in string theory, particularly the superstring theory, the perturbative expansion is such that the divergences cancel out. So they don't
