Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it logically.

The problem states that we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? And β is 1/(kT), so higher temperatures mean lower β. But here, I think I just need to compute the sum correctly.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, how many states are there in total? Each has 2 options, so 2^3 =8 possible states. That's manageable. So I can list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then compute exp(-βE) for each and sum them all.

But wait, that's a lot of work. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. So S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each product is +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different.

But wait, since each term is S_i S_j, if S_i and S_j are the same, their product is +1. So each term in the brackets is either +1 or -1. So the entire sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be from -3 to +3, but depending on how many pairs are aligned.

Wait, let me think about the possible values of the sum.

Each pair contributes +1 or -1. There are three pairs. So the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, no, let me check:

Wait no. Because three pairs, each contributing +1 or -1. The maximum sum is 3, when all three pairs are +1. The minimum is -3. But the possible sum values depend on how many pairs are +1 and how many are -1.

Wait, let me think: for three terms, each being ±1. The possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

For example:

All +1: sum =3.

Two +1, one -1: sum= 1+1 -1=1.

One +1, two -1: sum=1-1-1= -1.

All -1: sum=-3.

So the possible energies E are:

E = -J * (each possible sum of the three terms).

So for sum=3, E = -J *3.

Sum=1: E= -J *1.

Sum=-1: E= J *1.

Sum=-3: E= J *3.

Wait, no. Wait, E is -J times the sum. So for sum=3, E= -J*3. Sum=1, E=-J*1. Sum=-1, E= -J*(-1) = +J. Sum=-3, E= -J*(-3) = 3J.

So the possible energies are -3J, -J, +J, +3J.

Wait, but how many states correspond to each sum?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how each state contributes to the sum. Each state is a particular combination of S1, S2, S3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum for each possible state.

Each state is a triplet (S1,S2,S3), each being +1 or -1.

Total of 8 states.

Let me list all 8 states and calculate E for each.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
Compute S1S2: 1*1=1
S1S3:1*1=1
S2S3:1*1=1
Sum:1+1+1=3
E = -J *3 = -3J

2. (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum:1-1-1= -1
E= -J*(-1) = +J

3. (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum:-1+1-1= -1
E= +J

4. (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1-1+1= -1
E= +J

5. (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum:-1-1+1= -1
E= +J

6. (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1+1-1= -1
E= +J

7. (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum:1-1-1= -1
E= +J

8. (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3
E = -3J.

Wait, let's count the number of states with each energy.

Looking at the above, states 1 and 8 have E=-3J. So 2 states.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have E=+J. That's 6 states.

Wait, but wait, no. Let's check. Let me look at each state:

State 2: E=+J

State3: E=+J

State4: E=+J

State5: E=+J

State6: E=+J

State7: E=+J

Wait, no, state 7: E=+J. So states 2-7 are 6 states with E=+J. Oh wait, but wait, what about state 1 and 8? Both have E=-3J.

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-βE).

So for each state, compute exp(-β E), and sum them all.

Let me compute for each energy level.

For E = -3J, each state contributes exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3βJ). There are 2 such states. So contribution is 2 * exp(3βJ).

For E= +J, each state contributes exp(-β*(+J))=exp(-β J). There are 6 such states. So contribution is 6 * exp(-β J).

So total Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → 2 e^{-3β J} +6 e^{+β J} → No, because our first term is exp(3β J).

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → That's 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J} → Which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, E is -3J for the two states. So for each, exp(-β E) is exp(-β (-3J)) = exp(3β J). Yes.

For E=+J, it's exp(- β J). Yes.

So Z= 2 e^{3β J} +6 e^{- β J}.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → yes.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
Each spin pair \( S_iS_j \) contributes \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned. Since there are three pairs (\( S_1S_2, S_1S_3, S_2S_3 \)), the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \). Substituting this into the energy expression \( E = -J[\text{sum}] \), the possible energies are:
- \( E = -3J \) (sum = \( 3 \)),
- \( E = -J \) (sum = \( 1 \)),
- \( E = +J \) (sum = \( -1 \)),
- \( E = +3J \) (sum = \( -3 \)).

### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy
For three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By enumerating all states and their corresponding energies:
- **2 states** have \( E = -3J \) (e.g., \( (+1, +1, +1) \) and \( (-1, -1, -1) \)),
- **6 states** have \( E = +J \) (all other combinations).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Using the energy values and their multiplicities:
- For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(-\beta(-3J)) = 2 \exp(3\beta J) \),
- For \( E = +J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-\beta J) \).

Thus, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J).
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled and the coefficients are swapped.

### Final Answer
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
