Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars with the same masses as the Sun, each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic because the star moves in a small orbit around the system's center of mass. 

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. 

I remember that the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the velocity shift to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula I think is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) or wait, maybe I should think of the simplified version since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's. 

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) P^(1/3) ) ]

But since the star's mass (M_star) is much larger than the planet's mass (M_p), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the equation simplifies.

Let me write the simplified formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law here. Because the RV method is based on the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity in the orbit. 

The star's velocity in its orbit (v) is given by v = (2 pi a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit, and P is the orbital period. But also, from Newtonian mechanics, the star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. 

From the center of mass, the star's orbit radius (a_star) is given by a_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * a_planet. But since M_p << M_star, a_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) a_planet. 

Wait, but the orbital period P is the same for both the planet and the star. So, from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)). Again, since M_p is much smaller, P² ≈ (4 pi² a³) / (G M_star). 

So, a is proportional to (P² G M_star )^(1/3). 

But how does K, the velocity semi-amplitude, relate to these? 

K is the velocity of the star in its orbit. So K = (2 pi a_star) / P. 

Substituting a_star from above, a_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * a_planet. 

But a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, a_planet = (G M_star P² / (4 pi²)) )^(1/3). 

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula that relates K, the semi-amplitude, to the orbital period P, the planet's mass M_p, and the star's mass M_star. Because in this problem, M_p is similar for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars.

The formula I recall is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

But again, since M_p << M_star and e=0, this reduces to:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but wait, since both exoplanets have masses similar to Neptune, M_p is the same for both. Both stars have same mass as the Sun, M_star is same. 

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

But wait, wait.
