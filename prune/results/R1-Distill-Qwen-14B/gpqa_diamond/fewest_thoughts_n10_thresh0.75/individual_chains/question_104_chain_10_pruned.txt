Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Hmm, both planets are around stars similar to our Sun and have masses like Neptune, and the RV method was used. 

Wait, the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, and we measure that shift. So the shift in the spectral lines is related to the velocity of the star. 

The problem states that planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Oh, right, because a larger shift means the star is moving faster. So the velocity of the star (v) is proportional to the Doppler shift. I remember that the formula for the Doppler shift in terms of velocity is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But since the same wavelength is used, the ratio would just depend on the velocity.

So, the star's velocity (v) is higher for planet #2 since 7 > 5. But how does this relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I think the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the period. Wait, but both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are the same. The formula for the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude K) is given by K = (v_star) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )^(1/1) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P. Let me see. Because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). 

So, K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). That means if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

But wait, let me make sure I have the correct formula. The formula for K, the semi-amplitude, is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) )) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Hmm, maybe a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have same mass (Neptune), so M_planet is the same for both, and M_star is same for both. So the ratio K1/K2 can be found based on the periods of the planets.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)
