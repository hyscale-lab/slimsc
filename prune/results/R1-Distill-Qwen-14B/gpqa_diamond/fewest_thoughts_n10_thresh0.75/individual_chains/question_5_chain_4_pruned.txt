Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because angular momentum operators usually have that structure. So, P is probably the spin operator, since it's for a muon. Muons have spin-1/2, so the eigenvalues should be ±ħ/2.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector for P·n, where n lies in the x-z plane. Since n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented using an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would have φ=0 or something? Like, the direction could be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or similar. 

But wait, the eigenvectors for spin in an arbitrary direction are related to the eigenstates of the spin component along that direction. The general approach is to construct the operator P·n and find its eigenvectors.

Let me think about the components given. Px is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n has components (nx, 0, nz). And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. 

But since it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, I can parameterize n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the x-component is sinθ and z is cosθ. So then, the operator P·n is equal to (P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ). Because P·n = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But ny is zero here.

So putting it together, P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. The first term is sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]. The second term is cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together, the resulting matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator matrix is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. The equation is (P·n) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So ( (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] ) [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we have:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b].

So the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these as equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, so these are two equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But since we're looking for eigenvectors, the system should have a non-trivial solution, so the equations are dependent. Let's take equation 1 and see.

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Let me rearrange it. Let's solve for a in terms of b.

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] * b

Hmm, the denominator can be written as -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] *
