Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. P_y is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1]. The operator in question is P, and the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, n is a unit vector, right? Since it's in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that. Wait, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or something? Oh wait, no, because any direction in x-z can be parameterized by θ and φ where φ is the angle around the y-axis. But since it's arbitrary, maybe we don't need to worry about the specific angles.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So, the operator P is the vector operator, which is the sum of P_x, P_y, P_z multiplied by the components of the direction vector n. So the operator is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So, more precisely, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Oh wait, because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

The task is to find the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, the operator P must satisfy P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but the operator P is in the direction of n. So, the eigenvalue equation is (n · P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the operator along direction n is n·P, right? So that's the operator we're considering.

So, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Let me write out the matrix for the operator P. Let's compute n · P.

Each component of P is given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, n · P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Putting it all together, the matrix becomes:

n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So combining the matrices:

The (1,1) element is n_z * (ħ/2) * 1.

The (1,2) element is (n_x * ħ/2) * 1.

The (2,1) element is same as (1,2), which is (n_x ħ/2), because of the [0,1] part.

The (2,2) element is (-n_z) * (ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

[ [ (n_z ħ/2 ), (n_x ħ/2 ) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2 ), (-n_z ħ/2 ) ] ]

Alternatively, factoring out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x]; [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x]; [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation becomes:

| [n_z * ψ₁ + n_x * ψ₂ ] |
| [n_x * ψ₁ - n_z * ψ₂ ] | = | ψ₁ |
                           | ψ₂ |

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁
n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂

Let me rearrange the first equation:

( n_z -1 ) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → Equation (1)

Second equation:

n_x ψ₁ - (n_z +1 ) ψ₂ = 0 → Equation (2)

We can write these as:

Equation (1): (n_z -1) ψ₁ = -n_x ψ₂ → ψ₁ = [ -n_x ψ₂ ] / (n_z -1 )

Equation (2): n_x ψ₁ = (n_z +1 ) ψ₂ → ψ₁ = [ (n_z +1 ) ψ₂ ] / n_x

So, set the two expressions for ψ₁ equal:

[ -n_x ψ₂ ] / (n_z -1 ) = [ (n_z +1 ) ψ₂ ] / n_x

Assuming ψ₂ is not zero (otherwise, ψ₁ would also be zero, which is trivial), we can divide both sides by ψ₂:

- n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1 ) / n_x

Multiply both sides by n_x (n_z -1):

- n_x² = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

n_x² = -(n_z² -1 )

But wait, n_x² + n_z² =1, since n is a unit vector. Substituting n_x² = 1 - n_z²:

1 - n_z² = -(n_z² -1 )

Hmm, let's compute the right side:

-(n_z² -1 ) = -n_z² +1 = 1 - n_z².

So, 1 - n_z² = 1 - n_z².

So, this holds for any n_z. So that means the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, from equation (2): ψ₁ = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] ψ₂

So, the eigenvector can be written as (ψ₁, ψ₂) = [ (n_z +1 ) ψ₂ / n_x , ψ₂ ].

Let me factor out ψ₂:

ψ = ψ₂ [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x , 1 ]

Let me choose ψ₂ as a parameter, say, some scaling factor. Let's set ψ₂ = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple). Then, ψ₁ = (n_z +1)/n_x.

Wait, but n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z² =1. So, let me express in terms of θ, perhaps.

Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so we can parameterize it using θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, for the direction in x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from z, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero (since it's in the x-z plane, so no y component). So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, ψ₁ = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ.

And ψ₂ = 1. So, the eigenvector is [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ, 1 ].

But wait, this is up to normalization. Let's compute the normalization.

The vector is [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, 1 ].

Let me denote the vector as (a, 1), where a = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |1|^2 = 1.

Compute |a|^2: [ (1 + cosθ)^2 ] / sin²θ + 1 = [ (1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ) + sin²θ ] / sin²θ.

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so numerator becomes 1 + 2 cosθ +
