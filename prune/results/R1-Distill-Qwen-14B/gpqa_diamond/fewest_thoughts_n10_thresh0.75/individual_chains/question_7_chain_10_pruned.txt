Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the order of 1e4 to 1e5 GeV, so that's really high energy gamma-rays.

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production. The CMB is everywhere, so high-energy photons can interact with these low-energy CMB photons. But how does that limit the gamma-ray's lifetime?

Oh right, this has to do with photon-photon annihilation. When a high-energy gamma-ray meets a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. But for this to happen, there must be enough energy. The key is the center-of-mass energy.

The threshold energy for pair production is when the combined energy is just enough to create the rest mass of an electron (and positron, but since they're the same mass, it's 2m_e c²). The electron rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the threshold would be at least that. But wait, our gamma-rays here are way higher in energy, so the threshold is definitely met. But how does this affect their lifetime?

The lifetime in this context probably refers to the mean lifetime before annihilation. The process would lead to a loss of the gamma-ray, so the lifetime is how long such a gamma-ray can exist before annihilating. So we need to calculate the mean free time for annihilation and then find the energy where this time is significant compared to the age of the universe or something.

Wait, I think the formula for the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is important here. I remember that the cross-section σ increases with the energy, but I'm not sure of the exact form. Maybe it's proportional to some power of the photon energy.

Also, the process is more likely when the gamma-ray has enough energy to interact with the CMB photon. The cross-section might depend on the product of the photon energies. Since the CMB photon energy is much lower, the gamma-ray's energy is the main variable here.

So the interaction rate is probably proportional to the cross-section multiplied by the number density of CMB photons. The mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ, which is n * σ * v, where v is the relative velocity. But I'm not sure about the exact factors here.

Wait, I think for photon-photon annihilation, the cross-section σ scales with the square of the logarithm of the photon energy. Or maybe it's more precise to say that the cross-section is proportional to (E^2)/(m_e^2 c^4), where E is the gamma-ray energy. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to proceed.

The number density n of CMB photons can be calculated from the CMB temperature. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is much less than the typical thermal peak of about 0.23 keV (but wait, that's when T is about 2.7 K, since the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, so E ~ k_B T ≈ 0.00023 eV? Wait, the given average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is a bit higher than the typical 0.00023 eV, but I guess the exact number might not matter for the calculation.

Wait, perhaps we can model the interaction rate. The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by a certain expression. From what I recall, the cross-section for this process can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (
