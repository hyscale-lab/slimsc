Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is a pretty high mass but not extremely so. I think particles like the Z boson are around 90 GeV, so this is much lighter. But wait, maybe it's a different kind of boson? Well, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll just go with the given info.

The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit off. Oh, maybe it's supposed to be something like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f. Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling kind of term. Wait, Yukawa interactions usually have a scalar field coupling to fermions, which is exactly what this looks like. So X is a scalar boson because it's a field without derivatives or anything like that.

So the interaction term is Xψψ, meaning X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So when X decays, it can produce fermions. But which fermions are allowed? That depends on their mass and the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV. Wait, but in pair production, each fermion has a mass m, and their combined energy is 2m. So for a decay to be possible, 2m < M_X. So m < 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, not exactly. Because in reality, it's about the invariant mass. But for a decay, the minimum energy required is when the fermions are produced at rest, so their mass must be less than half the mass of X. So yes, m_f < M_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses (I think):

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I should check: I remember that the top quark is the heaviest, but others are lighter. For example, the charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV, so c quarks are okay.

But bottom quarks are about 4.5 GeV each. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So each is 4.5 GeV. So two b quarks would require 9 GeV total. But X is only 6 GeV, so 4.5 * 2 = 9 >6. So X can't decay into b quarks. So the decay X→b bbar is not allowed.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure. Let me think about the masses again.

u: ~2 MeV → way under 3 GeV.

d: ~3-5 MeV → same.

s: ~95-105 MeV → same.

c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV → same, as 1.5 <3.

b: ~4.5 GeV → each is 4.5, so two would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, but wait. Wait, another point: fermion masses are their rest masses. So for the pair production, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. So for X→f fbar, m_f must be less than 3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f < 3 GeV?

Looking at the quarks: u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all under 3 GeV. The bottom quark is 4.5, which is over 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

What about leptons? Let's see.

Electron: ~0.5 MeV.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV.

So the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So each tau is about 1.78 GeV, so two taus would be 3.56 GeV. So X (6 GeV) can decay into tau pairs because 3.56 <6. So X→tau tau is allowed.

What about the muon? Each muon is about 0.1 GeV (105 MeV), so two muons would be 0.2 GeV, much less than 6. So X can decay into muon pairs.

Same with electrons: two electrons would be ~1 MeV, negligible compared to 6 GeV.

So possible fermion pairs are:

u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar, tau taubar, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait: the problem statement says the interaction is with fermion fields ψ_f. So for each fermion species, X can decay into that species. So which fermions are light enough?

Well, all of the above except the bottom and top quarks (top is way heavier than 3 GeV, so even a single top would be impossible, but X is 6 GeV, which can't produce a top in any case).

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau tau, e e.

Wait, but X can't decay into b bbar because each b is 4.5 GeV. So 4.5*2=9>6. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau tau, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, this seems correct because c is about 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV for two, which is just under 6 GeV. So yes, c cbar is allowed.

Option C: includes c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, and also t tbar. But top quarks are way too heavy, so this is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b bbar, which we already determined isn't allowed. So D is out.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me quickly check other fermions. Are there any other fermions I might have missed? Like, maybe the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV each, which is over 3 GeV, so two of them would sum to 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So no, b bbar is not allowed.

Hence, the allowed decay channels are: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, that's option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, meaning \( X \) can decay into fermions if their combined rest mass is less than the mass of \( X \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \), the condition is \( 2m_f < M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses:
- **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Electron (\( e \)):** \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \). All these decays are allowed because \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) for all listed fermions. This option is correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
