Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions involving mCPBA and what happens when you run the products through HPLC columns. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that a chemist performs two reactions. Both involve treating either (E)-oct-4-ene or (Z)-oct-4-ene with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined, and run on standard and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out what peaks they would see in each case.

Wait, so mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But wait, does the geometry of the starting alkene affect the outcome?

Oh right, mCPBA is a peracid and it adds across the double bond in an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is stereospecific. The peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds with a specific stereochemistry. Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting alkene (E or Z) influence the epoxide structure?

Wait, I think when you have an alkene reacting with mCPBA, it creates an epoxide where the oxygen comes from the same face. So for an E and Z starting material, does the resulting epoxide have a particular configuration?

Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Epoxidation typically proceeds via a cyclic transition state where the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. Since mCPBA is a chiral oxidizing agent, it can lead to epoxidation with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, no. mCPBA is a chiral molecule. The configuration of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide. So for each starting alkene, (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation with mCPBA will form specific diastereomers.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric, isn't it? Because it's a trans (E) or cis (Z) double bond in the middle of the chain.
