Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction is doing. The starting material is acetic acid. Then:

1. It's treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that when acetic acid is treated with something like acetic anhydride and a brominating agent, it might be undergoing an acetylation or perhaps a substitution. Wait, bromine with pyridine in acetic anhydride sounds like a Friedel-Crafts type reaction. Oh wait, but wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, not an aromatic compound. Hmm, maybe it's about introducing a bromine somewhere else.

Wait, maybe it's an acetylation of the acid. So, acetic acid could be converted into an acetylated bromide. Wait, but how? Oh wait, bromine (Br2) in presence of pyridine is a reagent for introducing bromine as an electrophilic substitution. Oh wait, perhaps it's an acetylation followed by bromination. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for making an acetyl bromide.

Wait, another approach: when acetic acid is treated with acetic anhydride and a base like pyridine, it can form an acetylation product. Wait, but with bromine involved. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is acting as an elect
