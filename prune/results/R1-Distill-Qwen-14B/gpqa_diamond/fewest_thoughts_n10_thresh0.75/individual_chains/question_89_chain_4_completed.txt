Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; it's 1,3. Oh wait, maybe it's a diepoxide situation, but no, KOH is a base. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that usually needs two adjacent halogens. Oh wait, maybe it's a different structure. Oh wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons that are part of the adamantane structure.

Wait, when KOH is used in such a reaction, perhaps it's a double elimination. So two E2 reactions, removing two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. So heating with KOH would lead to the formation of an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, maybe? Or perhaps something else. Wait, maybe it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice to form a diene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh wait, so maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, KOH is a strong base, but if the product has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, like a nucleophilic substitution with OH- attacking. But that's more common in single displacements. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for esters.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dibromide undergoes a double nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group and maybe an SN2 mechanism. But for adamantane derivatives, the structure is very rigid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides.

Wait, the initial reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a product with a carbonyl group. Oh, maybe it's a ketone. So, if two bromides are on adjacent carbons, perhaps each loses a Br- and the carbons bond to each other, releasing HBr. Wait, but that would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the compound isn't forming a diene but something else.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that forms an epoxide. But wait, epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where one Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Oh, maybe it's an oxidation step. Wait, but KOH isn't a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann-Löffler reaction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think about the reaction conditions. KOH and heat... so for vicinal dihalides, KOH would eliminate to form alkenes. But here it's 1,3-dibromide, so perhaps the elimination is more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution followed by elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Wait, maybe the two bromides undergo a coupling reaction with KOH. But I'm not recalling that.

Wait, the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is a triplet integrating for 2H. That's around where an -OCH2- or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen would appear. Also, a peak at 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diketone. If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require oxidation. Wait, but KOH doesn't oxidize. Alternatively, perhaps it's a base-induced elimination to form a ketone via some mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible product structure. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a ketone or maybe an ester. Since the product is a solid, perhaps it's a bridged diketone. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules if two Brs are eliminated. But if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, then eliminating both could form a conjugated diene. But an alkene would have a peak in IR around 1650 cm-1, not 1720. So probably a ketone.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming 1,3-diol. Then, when heated with KOH, perhaps a dehydration occurs to form a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the product is a vicinal diol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

Product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone, probably. So, how does that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Another possibility: the reaction is a double elimination, but forming a conjugated diene. Wait, but then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the dihalide undergoes an oxidation. Wait, KOH is a base, but maybe under certain conditions, it can act as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250 cm-1, not 1720. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, where each ketone is formed from the elimination of Br. But how would that happen with KOH?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double substitution. Each Br is replaced by an O- group. For example, each Br is replaced by O-K+.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the bromides are replaced by hydroxide ions. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. Then, when heated with KOH, perhaps the diol loses water to form a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-diol on heating with a base would undergo elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl. But how? For example, in a vicinal diol, heating with acid could form a ketone via pinacol rearrangement. But here, it's KOH, a base. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination.

Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol losing water under acid conditions to form a carbonyl. Here, it's a 1,3-diol, so maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is a substitution reaction. Each Br is replaced by OH, forming 1,3-adamantane diol. Then, when heated, the diol undergoes elimination, perhaps forming an alkene, but that wouldn't give a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the diol loses two water molecules to form two carbonyl groups. But that seems unlikely without a way to form a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a ketone formed via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a peroxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination forming a carbonyl. Wait, elimination reactions typically form alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by oxidation, but KOH doesn't oxidize.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on opposite ends of the structure. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the structure isn't vicinal, so maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a double elimination, but instead of forming a double bond, it forms a ketone. That doesn't make sense because elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridged ketone. If the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating both could form a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving, and the two carbons forming a double bond, but that would give an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Maybe the dihalide reacts with two equivalents of KOH, each Br- leaving and being replaced by OH-, forming a diol. Then, when heated, the diol undergoes some kind of elimination, perhaps forming a ketone via a retro-aldol or similar mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses two molecules of water, forming a carbonyl group. But for that, the diol structure would need to allow such dehydration. If the diol is 1,3-diol on adamantane, maybe upon heating, the central part could form a ketone. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone group, but that would require only one substitution, but the starting material is a dibromide, so perhaps two substituents.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. It has a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region for CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide. The 1.94 ppm for 2H could be another CH2 group perhaps.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-diketone. If each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But how would that happen from KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then perhaps some kind of cyclization occurs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction produces a diol, which then forms a ketone via oxidation. But KOH doesn't oxidize; perhaps another reagent would. But the problem states that KOH is used.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but each elimination forms an alkene and a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a peroxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak is at 1720, which is indicative of a ketone (around 1715 cm^-1). So product 1 is a ketone. So the starting material must have undergone a reaction that forms a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide undergoes a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then perhaps the structure undergoes some dehydration to form a ketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a coupling. For example, two equivalents of KOH could deprotonate something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, with each Br leaving as Br- and the two carbons bonding, but that would form a double bond. But the IR doesn't fit that.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should move on to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes an elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone, so when treated with a Lewis acid, maybe it's undergoing a dehydration to form an alkene, but that would require adjacent hydroxyl groups.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is facilitating an elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. Let me think: if product 1 were a diol, then heating with aluminum isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) could cause elimination, forming an alkene.

But earlier, product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which would suggest a carbonyl, not an alcohol. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but as I thought earlier, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But how would that form from KOH and 1,3-dibromide? Unless it's a coupling reaction, but I don't recall that.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the NMR. Product 1's NMR:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet): could be adjacent to an oxygen, maybe OCH2.

- 2.41-2.23 (10H): these are probably CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a ring structure.

- 1.94 ppm (2H): maybe another CH2 group, perhaps near a carbonyl.

If product 1 is a diketone, then the 4.79 ppm would be something else, perhaps a CH2 near an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a bridged ketone. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, their elimination would form a bridge with a ketone group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone and an adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first reaction. Let me try to think about the second and third steps to see if that sheds light.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is an alkene.

So, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Lewis acid) to form product 2, which is an alkene. So product 1 must have been an alcohol or some compound that can form an alkene under Lewis acid conditions. Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But how?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Unless the Lewis acid causes the ketone to rearrange or form an enol, which then eliminates to form an alkene.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid causes dehydration to form an alkene. But then product 1's IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, which under acid conditions could eliminate to form a carbonyl group. But that would require a structure where two hydroxyl groups are on the same carbon, leading to a carbonyl upon elimination. However, that would require a ketone, which is product 1.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, and when treated with Lewis acid, it dehydrates to form a ketone. But that doesn't make sense because product 1 already is a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a substituted cyclohexane with a ketone group. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if the dihalide underwent a substitution with OH groups, then perhaps further reaction could form an ester. But I'm not sure how that would work with KOH.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a diol, and the Lewis acid causes it to form an epoxide, but that doesn't fit.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to summarize what I know:

1. Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. Reaction with KOH gives product 1, which is a ketone (IR 1720 cm-1).

3. Product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3 to give product 2, which is an alkene (because ozonolysis in step 3 is used on alkenes).

4. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which is a carbonyl compound.

So, the NMR of product 3 is what's being asked.

Let me think about product 3. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. The structure of product 2 would influence how the ozonolysis proceeds.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene within the adamantane structure, the ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern in product 3 would depend on the structure of the alkene in product 2.

Wait, but the initial question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

In ozonolysis, the reagent O3 adds to the double bond, breaking it. The work-up (with dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive work-up) would lead to the formation of carbonyl groups. If the alkene in product 2 was symmetrical, the resulting carbonyl compounds would be identical, and their NMR would show specific coupling patterns.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 2. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. Product 1 is a ketone. So, how does a ketone react with a Lewis acid to form an alkene?

Wait a minute, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. No, because the IR showed a carbonyl.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a diepoxide, but earlier I thought that's not likely. Wait, but if product 1 is a diepoxide, then treating it with a Lewis acid might cause ring-opening, but that doesn't lead directly to an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid (Al(OiPr)3) causes the diol to lose water and form an alkene via elimination. That would fit. So, product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene.

But wait, product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, so that can't be a diol. So this line of thinking may be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if the dihalide reacted with an alcohol in the presence of KOH, forming an ester. But with KOH and heat, that's more like saponification for esters.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that product 1 is a diketone. Let's say 1,3-diketone. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, for example, the diketone could undergo a retro-aldol reaction under acidic conditions to form an alkene and a ketone. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol, which under acid (from the Lewis acid) conditions would eliminate to form a carbonyl group. But that would require a specific structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes ring-opening or rearrangement to form an alkene.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step. When product 2 (an alkene) undergoes ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3 depends on the neighboring hydrogens.

Assuming product 2's alkene is symmetric, the ozonolysis would produce two identical carbonyl compounds. But if the alkene is asymmetric, the products would be different.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near a carbonyl group, perhaps on a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

In the ozonolysis product, the carbonyls would be on each end, and any adjacent hydrogens would have specific coupling.

For example, if the ozonolysis produces a compound with a structure like (CH2)nCO, the adjacent CH2 group would have neighboring Hs that couple with them.

Wait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is an alkene in a chain: CH2=CH-CH2-... Then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds, each with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

Each of these would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl, and the Hs on that CH2 would be next to another CH2 group (if any), leading to coupling.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, product 3's NMR is what's being asked. The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Its coupling pattern would depend on neighboring Hs.

If the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on each neighboring group.

Wait, for example: If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-X, then the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, more precisely, each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be coupled with the Hs on the next CH2 group.

So, if the next group is another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But wait, each H on the first CH2 is equivalent, so each would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2 that's split into a triplet, then the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 next to the carbonyl is between two CH2 groups, then each H on that CH2 would see two Hs from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the most deshielded H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-X. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say position 2) would be adjacent to the CH2 in position 3. Each H on position 2 would couple with the two Hs on position 3. Since position 3's Hs are split into a triplet (if adjacent to another group), the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, but in the simplest case, if the CH2 next to carbonyl is between two CH2 groups, each H on the middle CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent groups are identical, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps if the H is on a CH2 that is adjacent to another CH2, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 which is next to a CH3, then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group, and the only neighboring Hs are on another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H on the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is itself next to another group, the splitting could be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but without the exact structure, it's hard to be precise.

Let me recap:

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene). The most deshielded H in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, e.g., on a CH2 next to the carbonyl.

The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs. For example, if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but each H on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each neighboring CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. Wait, no: the neighboring CH2 has two Hs, each of which couples with the H in question.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of splitting. Each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2. Those Hs could be in a triplet if the adjacent group has two Hs.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-OH (though the actual structure might vary). The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say position 2) would be next to the CH2 in position 3. The position 3 CH2 has two Hs. Each H on position 2 would couple with the two Hs on position 3. Since each H on position 3 is a doublet (coupled with the position 2 Hs), the position 2 Hs would each be a triplet.

But wait, no. The splitting of the Hs depends on the number of neighboring Hs. If each H on position 2 is next to two Hs on position 3, then each H on position 2 would split into a triplet.

Wait, the n+1 rule: if a proton is next to n equivalent protons, it will split into n+1 peaks.

So for position 2, each H is next to two Hs (from position 3), so each would be split into a triplet.

But wait, that would be the case if the neighboring group is a single CH2. But if the neighboring group is a CH2 which is itself split into a triplet, it would complicate things. No, the splitting is based on the immediate neighboring Hs, regardless of their own splitting.

So, if the H is on a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 group, which has two Hs, then the H would be a triplet.

But looking at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, option A is a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two different CH2 groups. For example, CH3-CH2-CO-R. Then, the Hs on the CH2 next to the CO would be next to two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So each H on that CH2 would be a triplet.

But another scenario: if the H is on a CH2 that is next to a CH group, which has two Hs, but that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 next to a CH2 group and another group, leading to more splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs, and another CH2 group, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

But without the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, going back to the NMR data for product 1. The triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H suggests that these Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps OCH2. The 1.94 ppm for 2H could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, product 1's structure might be something like OCH2-CH2-CO-R, where R is the adamantane structure.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3, which would act as a Lewis acid catalyst. Perhaps the OCH2-CH2-CO-R undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is OCH2-CH2-CO-R, perhaps the oxygen is part of an ester or ether. But under Lewis acid conditions, maybe the ester undergoes elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, for example, if it's an ester: R-O-CO-R'. Then, under certain conditions, it could eliminate to form an alkene and a carboxylic acid. But that's more like saponification or transesterification.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diol, and elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, but product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so it's unlikely to be an ester because esters have carbonyls as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. For example, a secondary alcohol and a ketone on the same molecule.

But then heating with a Lewis acid would cause the alcohol to eliminate, perhaps forming an alkene if a suitable proton is available.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a ketone. So the structure might be something like:

R-CO-CH2-OH

But then, under Lewis acid conditions, the OH could lose a proton, and a neighboring group could participate in elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, allowing for dehydration to form an alkene.

If product 1 is R-CO-CH2-OH, heating with Al(OiPr)3 (a Lewis acid) could protonate the OH, making it a better leaving group. Then, a neighboring group (like the carbonyl) could facilitate elimination, forming an alkene.

So, R-CO-CH2-OH → R-CO-CH2-OH2+ → R-CO-CH2-O+-Al something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is on a carbon adjacent to another carbon, allowing for E2 elimination with the carbonyl oxygen as the base.

Wait, that might form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. For example, if the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', ozonolysis would break the central double bond into R-CO and R'-CO groups.

But in reality, enones have the structure R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' would not have a double bond. Wait, no, an enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' only if there's a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-CO-CH2-CH=CH-CO-R'.

Wait, no, the enone would be R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it R-CO-CH2-CH=CH-CO-R'? No, that's not correct. An enone is a conjugated ene and ketone, such as R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R' wouldn't be an enone. An enone would have the structure R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-CO-CH2-CH=CH-CO-R' but that's not correct. Actually, an enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' without a double bond, but if there's a double bond between the two carbons adjacent to the ketone, it becomes an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But ozone tends to break double bonds into carbonyls, so ozonolysis of an enone would produce two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but in the case of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ozonolysis would break the double bond, converting it into two carbonyl groups. For example, (E)-CH2-CO-R would become two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-OH. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but product 3's structure depends on where the double bond was in product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces two identical carbonyl compounds, each with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. So, each would have a triplet for those Hs.

But I'm not entirely certain. Considering the options, the correct answer is likely a triplet (option A), but I'm not 100% sure.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with excess KOH.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (Product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data for Product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, and a peak at 1.94 ppm (2H), possibly from a CH₂ group near a carbonyl.  
   - This suggests that Product 1 is likely a ketone or a related structure with a carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - Lewis acids often catalyze eliminations or rearrangements.  
   - Given that Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step, it must contain a double bond. Thus, Product 2 is likely an alkene formed via elimination from Product 1.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in Product 2, forming Product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the neighboring hydrogens. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, the hydrogen would couple with two equivalent hydrogens, resulting in a triplet.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, where the hydrogen couples with two equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, which is less likely here.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two different sets of hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the expected structure.

Based on the analysis, the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern.
