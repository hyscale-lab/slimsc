Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that's related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The mean lifetime, maybe? Oh right, because the decay distance would be how far it travels before it decays, so it's velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

But how do I calculate that? I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. In particle physics, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units! I have to make sure everything is in the right units. Let's think: ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 ×
