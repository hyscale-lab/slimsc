Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), the mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and the width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But how do I connect these given values to the decay distance?

Oh right, the mean lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ. I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units! Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in J·s. I'll need to convert units properly.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay length. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. That would be L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle.

But wait, how do I find v? The particle is produced with energy E, so relativistic effects are important. I'll need to calculate the velocity using the energy and mass.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the velocity. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)
