Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Hmm, okay. First, I think I need to recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I remember that in such models, the energy levels of a molecule are considered as a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. But wait, the question mentions the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The molecule is currently in the fundamental state, and we need to find the photon momentum that would take it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I think that the next state would be the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the molecule can absorb a photon that allows it to transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition requires a lower energy photon? Or maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition because the rotational states have their own selection rules.

Wait, but the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think incorporates both rotation and vibration. So, perhaps the energy levels are quantized in both aspects. But the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules). However, for diatomic molecules, the rigid rotor model usually has J as an integer (0,1,2,...) and the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ=±2, I think. But this is the non-rigid rotor, which I'm not as familiar with.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the energy levels in the non-rigid rotor. The energy for the non-rigid rotor would include both rotational and vibrational terms. So the total energy E is the sum of rotational energy and vibrational energy.

The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But for a non-rigid rotor, I think B may vary with vibrational state, but perhaps we can treat it as a rigid rotor for the purposes of this problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next higher energy state, which could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1). But which one requires less energy?

Wait, let's
