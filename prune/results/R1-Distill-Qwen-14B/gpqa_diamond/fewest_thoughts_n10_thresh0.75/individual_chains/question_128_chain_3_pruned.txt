Okay, so I've just started this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me four plasmid options, and I need to figure out which one to use.

Hmm, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have a promoter that the bacteria can recognize. Oh right, E. coli uses certain promoters like the T7 promoter. Wait, the BL21 strain is a commonly used strain for protein expression because it's deficient in some proteases, which helps in getting the protein intact. But I think the key here is the cloning vector and the presence of the correct promoter.

Looking at the options, each one is a DNA sequence starting with ATG, which is the start codon. But wait, the actual plasmid sequence probably includes a promoter before the ATG. Oh, because in the plasmid, the gene of interest is cloned under a promoter.

So the Human P53 gene has a specific sequence, but the plasmid's sequence should include a promoter like T7, which is commonly used with BL21 because these strains have the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter (like lacUV5). So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the gene.

Looking at the options, each one starts with ATG, which is the start codon, but the plasmid must have the T7 promoter before that. Oh wait, the beginning of the plasmid sequences might show this.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The plasmid probably starts with the promoter, then the coding sequence. So in the given options, do any of them show the T7 promoter?

Wait, the options provided are the coding sequences of the plasmids. Looking at the options, each starts with ATG. Wait, no, the first few nucleotides before ATG would be the promoter. Oh wait, no, the sequences given are the ORF sequences, perhaps? Or maybe the plasmid sequences include the promoter.

Wait, perhaps I should check for presence of a T7 promoter in the plasmid. The T7 promoter is recognized by T7 RNA polymerase. It's a specific sequence, like 5'-T7-gp3-3' which is a specific DNA sequence that the T7 RNA polymerase binds to
