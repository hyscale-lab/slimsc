Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine in such reactions usually acts as an electrophile and substitutes a hydrogen on the benzene ring. The question is about the para-isomer yield for each substance when they undergo this reaction, and then arranging them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, the substances are numbered 1 to 6. Let me list them out again to make sure I get them right.

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene, right? A methyl group attached to benzene.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's benzoic acid ethyl ester. So an ester group, OCOEt.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. A chlorine substituent.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethylbenzene. An ethyl group.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. A carboxylic acid group.

The reaction is electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. So each substituent directs the incoming Br either ortho/para or meta, depending on their nature.

I think the key here is to determine the directing effect of each substituent because the para-isomer's yield depends on where the substitution occurs.

Let me recall the substituents and their directing effects.

- Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group, ortho/para director. But wait, sometimes if it's a bulky group, could it direct more to para? Hmm, but methyl is less bulky, so it's mainly ortho and para.

- COOEt (ester): The ester group is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl). So ester is meta-directing. So substitution would mostly happen in meta positions.

- Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing by inductive effect but donates electrons through resonance (but wait, no, I think chlorine's inductive effect dominates, making it deactivating, but ortho/para director because it can donate via resonance? Or is it that the lone pairs can be used in resonance, making the ring deactivating but ortho/para directing. So Cl is ortho/para.

Wait, no, wait. For halogens: they are deactivating (because of stronger inductive effect) but ortho/para directors because the lone pairs can participate in resonance. So Cl is ortho/para.

- NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating group and meta-directing. So substitution happens meta to the nitro group.

- C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl, it's an activating group, so ortho/para director. But maybe the ethyl group is more bulky than methyl, so perhaps para is favored more than ortho. But I'm not sure if that's a significant factor here.

- COOH (carboxylic acid): The COOH group is a strong deactivating group (due to the electronegative O's and the electron-withdrawing effect of the double bond). So it's meta-directing. Wait, but wait: in benzoic acid, the -COOH group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So substitution would be meta.

Wait, let me think again. The substituent's effect on directing and activating or deactivating:

1. CH3 (toluene): activating, o/p director.

2. COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director.

3. Cl (chlorobenzene): deactivating, o/p director.

4. NO2 (nitrobenzene): deactivating, meta.

5. C2H5 (ethylbenzene): activating, o/p director.

6. COOH (benzoic acid): deactivating, meta.

Wait, but wait about the COOEt group. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because
