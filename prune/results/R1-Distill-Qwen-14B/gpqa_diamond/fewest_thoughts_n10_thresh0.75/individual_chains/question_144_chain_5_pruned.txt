Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that X is a meson resonance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, like a quark and an antiquark bound together. Resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist for very long, right? Because I think resonances are unstable and decay quickly.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance. Hmm. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which gives τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait, the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so more accurately, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Because Γ is the energy width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so that makes sense.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, I need to make sure I get the units right. Let me think about the steps.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. Then, find the speed of the meson X, but since it's produced at a high energy, I might need to use relativistic equations. Oh, right, the mean decay distance is c multiplied by τ multiplied by the velocity of the particle (βc), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the mean decay length is given by L = cτβ, where β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light. So first I need to find β. How do I find β given the energy and mass?

The energy E of the particle is related to its mass and momentum. The total energy E is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So I can rearrange this to find the momentum p.

Let's plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Wait, but I should probably convert these into standard units to avoid confusion. Let's see, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. But I think when working with units where c=1 and ħ=1, the equations are easier, but
