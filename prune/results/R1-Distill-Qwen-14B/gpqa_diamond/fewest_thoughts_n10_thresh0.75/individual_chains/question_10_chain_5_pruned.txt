Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities, and I'm supposed to figure out which one has the highest density. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing different properties of the planets. I need to find out which has the highest density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume. That's the key formula here.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has Earth's mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's. So a) has a density of about 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given. So density is 5.5. But wait, does the mass affect the density here? Because density is given, so for option b, it's 5.5. So same as a) but higher mass? Wait, no, because the density is already given as 5.5 for option b. So I can't tell just yet—maybe it's same as a, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm. Composition affects density because if it's same composition, the density would be same as Earth's. But wait, Earth's density is 5.5. So if this planet has same composition, same density, but more mass. So more mass would imply a larger radius, because volume depends on radius cubed. Let me think. Earth's mass (M) is about 5.97e24 kg, radius (R) about 6.37e6 meters. Density is M/( (4/3)π R³ ). So if the mass is 5 times more, but same composition, same density, then R would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. So 5^(1/3) is about 1.71, so radius increases by that factor. So the density remains the same. So option c's density is 5.5, same as a and b.

Option d) A planet with the
