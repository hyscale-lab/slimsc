Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I'll look at the given NMR data. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). I need to understand each of these signals.

Let's think about what each peak represents. The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably an acetate group, like OAc. The singlet means the three protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons, which makes sense because the methyl group in acetate is usually deshielded and doesn't have adjacent protons.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) might be a methyl group attached to a double bond. Because it's a doublet, the protons are split by one neighboring proton. Wait, but if it's attached to a double bond, maybe it's like a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. For example, in propenyl or butenyl acetates, the structure would have a double bond, and the substituents could vary.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit tricky. The multiplicity here suggests splitting from two different neighboring groups. Since it's a doublet of quadruplets, maybe the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. Wait, no—more accurately, a doublet of quartets? Or perhaps a doublet of doublets, but the notation is a bit unclear. Wait, the data says 'dq' which might be a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets, but I'm not sure. Let me think: in allylic positions, you often see such splitting due to coupling with multiple adjacent protons.

Looking at the 7.0 ppm peak: it's a doublet with a J of 16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests coupling with a vinyl proton. A doublet usually implies two neighboring protons, but 16 Hz seems high for a vicinal coupling. Wait, no—actually, 16 Hz is a typical value for trans coupling in alkenes. So maybe this is a trans coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a double bond with substituents. The 7.0 ppm peak is one proton on a double bond, coupled to another proton on the same or adjacent carbon.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Acetates would have an OAc group attached to a carbonyl, which is connected to the rest of the molecule. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be something like CH2CH2COOAc, but with double bonds.

Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CH-CH2-... but as an ester, it would be CH2CH2COOAc. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, butenyl acetate would have four carbons in the chain. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc or something similar, but depends on the substituents.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. So propenyl is three carbons, butenyl is four.
