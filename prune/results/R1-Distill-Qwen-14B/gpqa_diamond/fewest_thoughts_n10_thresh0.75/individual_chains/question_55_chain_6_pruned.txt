Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure of an organic compound. The question is about identifying an unknown compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

The given 1H NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I think I should start by analyzing each of these signals. Let's break them down.

The 2.1 ppm triplet is a singlet (s) with 3H. That probably means it's a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like maybe an ester. Because in acetates, the ester group is OAc, which has a methyl that's a singlet. So that must be the acetate part. So the compound is an acetate, which matches all the options.

Next, looking at the 1.6 ppm signal, it's a doublet (d) with 3H. That suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH group. Wait, but waitâ€”no, doublet for 3H? Oh, wait, 3H as a doublet. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to another CH. Like in an allylic position, perhaps. Maybe a propenyl or butenyl group.

Then there's the 5.5 ppm signal, a doublet of quadruplets (dq), 1H. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Or perhaps I misread; sometimes it's written as dq, but maybe it's a doublet and quartet. Alternatively, it could be a doublet of doublets or a more complex splitting.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That seems like a relatively large coupling constant. A coupling of 16 Hz is quite big, which is typical for a trans coupling in alkenes. Wait, no, wait. For alkenes, the coupling between vicinal protons is around 6-18
