Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met, like conservation laws and energy considerations.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes an interaction where the boson X couples to fermions. The term λf probably denotes the coupling strength for each fermion type f.

So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the total energy must be at least twice the fermion mass. Because X has a mass of 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay products must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Otherwise, the decay wouldn't be kinematically allowed.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is the heaviest, but its mass is around 173 GeV, way higher than 3 GeV. So top quarks are out of the question for decay products. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is also above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks either. Oh wait, wait, that depends on whether the fermion's rest mass is less than half the X mass.

Wait, half of 6 GeV is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product. Let's list the fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Quarks:
up, down: ~2-5 MeV (so well under 3 GeV)
strange: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
charm: around 1.5 GeV
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV (so over 3 GeV)
Top: way too heavy.

So, fermions that can come from X decay are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because their masses are under 3 GeV. But wait, the charm
