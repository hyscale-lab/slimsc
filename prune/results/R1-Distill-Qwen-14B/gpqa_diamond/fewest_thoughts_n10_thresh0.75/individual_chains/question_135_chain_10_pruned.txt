Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f \barψ_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I think I can work through this.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options given are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, so I need to find which particles X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws. Okay, kinematic allowance depends on the masses of the decay products. So, for a decay X → particles, the sum of the rest masses of the products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Let me recall the masses of the fermions. Let's see:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Okay, X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. Let's think about each possible pair.

First, considering quarks:

- b quarks: each is about 4.7 GeV. So 2 * 4.7 is 9.4 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can’t decay into b bbar, because the sum is 9.4 GeV which is larger than X's mass. So that would be kinematically forbidden. So any option that includes b bbar is incorrect.

Wait, the options: Looking at option A, it includes b bbar, which would be impossible. So option A is out.

Option D also includes b bbar, so D is out too.

What about the other quarks?

- c cbar: each c is ~1.3 GeV. Sum is 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.
- s sbar: each s is 95 MeV, so 190 MeV. X can decay into s sbar.
- u ubar: each u is about 2 MeV, so sum is 4 MeV. Definitely allowed.
- d dbar: similar to u, each about 5 MeV, sum 10 MeV. Allowed.

Leptons:

- tau pair: each tau is ~1.78 GeV. So sum is 3.56 GeV, less than 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.
- mu mu: each mu is ~0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV), sum 0.211 GeV. Allowed.
- e e: each is 0.000511 GeV, sum is negligible. Allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? The t quark is way too heavy. Its mass is about 173 GeV, so 2 * 173 is 346 GeV, way higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into t tbar. Any option including t tbar is wrong.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: includes c cbar, s sbar,
