Okay, so I've got this question here about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I need to figure out which one isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about spontaneous symmetry breaking and the particles mentioned.

So, spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's in a particular state. For example, in superconductivity, the symmetry is broken when the material becomes superconducting. The particles associated with this are called "Nambu-Goldstone bosons," right?

Looking at the options: Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, Pion.

Let me go through each one.

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. I remember that in solids, phonons arise from the vibrations of atoms. Do they have to do with symmetry breaking? Well, in a perfect crystal, the structure is symmetric. Phonons are the quasiparticles that describe the vibrations, but wait, do they come from a broken symmetry? I'm not so sure. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, phonons are more about lattice vibrations, which might not directly relate to spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry or something like that. Maybe phonons are more about broken translational symmetry? Not sure.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were originally proposed as a model of atomic nuclei. But wait, I think they're also related to magnetic systems. Skyrmions arise in magnetic materials when there's a broken symmetry, like in the Skyrmion lattice. I think they are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. So B might not be the correct answer because the question is asking which is NOT associated.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a crystal lattice. They arise from the quantized spin waves in a magnetically ordered system. So, when a magnetic material undergoes a phase transition and orders (like ferromagnetic ordering), the continuous symmetry is broken, and magnons are the Goldstone bosons for that. So magnons are tied to broken symmetry. So C is associated, so not the answer.

Option D: Pion. Pions are the lightest mesons, composed of up and anti-down quarks or similar combinations. In particle physics, pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chrom
