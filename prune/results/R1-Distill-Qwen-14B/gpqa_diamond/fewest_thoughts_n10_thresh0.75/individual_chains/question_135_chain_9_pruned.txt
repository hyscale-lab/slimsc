Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. Let's see what I know so far.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think this is describing how the boson X interacts with fermions. The interaction seems to involve some coupling λ and involves fermion fields ψ_f, which probably are Dirac spinors.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I'm looking for possible decay channels of X into fermion-antifermion pairs. The general rule is that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. So, m_X ≥ 2 m_fermion.

Now, I need to list all the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Let's list the fermions and their masses, approximately.

Electron (e^-): mass ~0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV, way less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Same with muon (μ): m_μ ≈ 0.105 GeV. 2m_μ ≈ 0.21 GeV. So that's okay.

Tau (τ): m_τ ~1.777 GeV. 2m_τ ≈3.554 GeV. So that's under 6 GeV, so X can decay into τ+ τ-.

What about quarks? Let's see:

Up quark (u): m_u ≈ 2.2 MeV, which is even lighter. So 2m_u is negligible, so u u-bar is allowed.

Down quark (d): m_d ~4.7 MeV. Again, 2m_d is negligible, so d d-bar is allowed.

Strange quark (s): m_s ~95 MeV (but wait, sometimes considered around 100 MeV). 2m_s would be about 0.19 GeV. So that's way below 6 GeV, so s s-bar is allowed.

Charm quark (c): m_c ~1.25 GeV. 2m_c ≈2.5 GeV <6 GeV. So c c-bar is allowed.

Bottom quark (b): m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b ≈9 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because the mass is too low.

Top quark (t): way heavier, like ~173 GeV. So no way, 2m_t is way higher than 6 GeV. So t t-bar is out.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau tau, e e. But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV. So b b-bar is forbidden. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c, s s, u u, d d, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So all these are allowed because 2m_c ~2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So B looks possible.

Option C: Includes t t-bar. But 2m_t is 346 GeV, way above X's mass. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b b-bar. As before, that's not allowed, so D is out.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Lagrangian given is the interaction
