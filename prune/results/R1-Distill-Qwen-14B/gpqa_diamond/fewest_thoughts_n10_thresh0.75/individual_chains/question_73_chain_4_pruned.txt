Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative velocity. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. There's a special formula for adding velocities in relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait no, wait. Because in relativity, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just v1 - v2. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity u is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So u = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u = (0.1c)/(0.7) = 0.142857...c. Hmm, so approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, let's see. Option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part down.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has rest mass, but they're moving, so their total energies would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². Wait, but each astronaut's mass is
