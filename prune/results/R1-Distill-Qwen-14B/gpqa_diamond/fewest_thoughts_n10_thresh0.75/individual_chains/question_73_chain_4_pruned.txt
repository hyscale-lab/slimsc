Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to use Einstein's theory of relativity. 

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options given are A through D, each with different relative speeds and total energies.

First, I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. I think relative velocity in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, there's a formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Oh, right, if one object is moving at speed u and the other at speed v in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the slower one (the one moving at v) would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, but which astronaut are we taking as the reference? Because the question just says 'relative speed' without specifying the direction. Oh, wait, relative speed is a scalar, so it's the magnitude. But wait, no, in this context, since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference divided by the term, but I have to be careful whether u is larger than v or vice versa.

Wait, let me clarify: astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So, from the perspective of astronaut B, what's the speed of astronaut A? Or is it the other way around? Alternatively, maybe I don't have to care about which perspective, because the relative speed is the same in magnitude but the direction would matter if considering vectorially, but the problem just asks for the relative speed, which I think is the magnitude.

Wait, but relative velocity depends on which frame you're in. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then the relative speed of A as
