Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The details given are that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those wavelengths are the same for both. Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L is proportional to R² * T⁴. So L = 4πR²σT⁴. So if I can find the temperatures, I can find the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but how do I find the temperatures? The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I think that's given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, about 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K.

If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is the same, T1 = T2. That's a key point. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. Could there be any Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths? Because the radial velocities are given. Oh, right! The stars are moving relative to us, which would cause a Doppler shift in the measured wavelengths.

So for Star_1, radial velocity is 0, so no Doppler shift. So the λ_max observed is the same as the emitted. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but radial velocity can be towards or away from us. The problem
