Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait a secondâ€”when spots cover part of the surface, I thought the effective temperature would be lower because the spots are cooler. Hmm, but the question says the overall Teff decreases, which makes sense because the spots are darker and cooler, so the average would go down. Got it.

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so the ratio N1/N2 (level 1 to level 2) is decreasing when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. We need to find the factor, which is (N1/N2) without spots divided by (N1/N2) with spots. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels depends on the temperature. The ratio of populations between two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. Oh wait, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So let's think about the ratio when the star is spotted.

Let me define R as (N1/N2) when no spots, and R' as (N1/N2) when spots are present. The question says R' is lower than R, so R
