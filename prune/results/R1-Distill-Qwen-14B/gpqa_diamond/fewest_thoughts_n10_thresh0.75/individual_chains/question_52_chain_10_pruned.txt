Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of energy levels in atoms. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and their respective energies. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I'm guessing that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom moves from level 2 to level 1, since higher energy levels emit photons when they drop to lower ones.

So the energy difference (E2 - E1) can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me calculate that.

Wait, the problem gives the wavelength as 1448 Å. Let me convert that into meters because constants like h and c are usually in meters. 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters.

E = hc/λ. Let's compute that. h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is about 3e8 m/s. So,

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.37e-18 J.

Hmm, but wait, I think energy is often expressed in electron volts (eV) in these contexts. Let me convert that. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So,

E = 1.37e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.55 eV.

Wait, or wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me do the math again:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-7 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372.

Then, 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18.

So E ≈ 1.372e-18 J, which is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, 1.372e-18 divided by 1.602e-19 is (1.372/0.1602) * (1e-18/1e-19) )= (8.56) * 10 = 85.6? Wait, no, no, wait. 1e-18 divided by 1e-19 is 10. So 1.372 / 0.1602 ≈ 8.56, times 10 is 85.6 eV? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 1.372e-18 J is
