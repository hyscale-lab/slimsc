Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. Spin 1/2 particles... I remember that their spin can be either up or down. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, so Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. Wait, and gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right?

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin will align with this field. The energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are given by E = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, that would be E = -gamma B Sz. But wait, Sz for spin 1/2 can be +1/2 or -1/2 in units of ħ, I think. So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2), or wait no, wait. Let me think: mu is gamma S, so E = - mu · B. So if B is along Z, E = -gamma B S_z. S_z is ± ħ/2, so E = ± gamma B ħ/2. Wait but the sign: if the magnetic moment is in the same direction as B, it should lower the energy. So when S_z is positive (aligned), E is negative. So yeah, E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- is +gamma B (ħ/2).

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. So the particle is in a state where the field is zero. But wait, no, the first field is turned off, and another is turned on along +Y. So after the change, the magnetic field is along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes from being proportional to S_z to being proportional to S_y.

Wait, but the initial state is when the field is along Z, so the spin is aligned in that direction. So when the field is turned off, the state remains the same, but the Hamiltonian
