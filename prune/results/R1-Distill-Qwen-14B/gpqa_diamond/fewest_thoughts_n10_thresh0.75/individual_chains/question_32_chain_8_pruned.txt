Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light (c). Nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, I remember that Lithium typically has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Wait, no, wait. Li usually has 3 protons. Let me double-check: Li has atomic number 3, so the isotope notation is ^A_3Li. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, A is 3 + 3 =6, so it's Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of this nucleus is 0.96c. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's given, but sometimes total energy is considered. Wait, wait, the question asks for the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so each nucleus is moving at a certain speed, and the energy is the total energy or the kinetic energy. Hmm, but I think in these cases, when you're
