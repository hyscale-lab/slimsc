Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a different nucleus called X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think.

Wait, Li is lithium. So the nucleus X is lithium-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the atomic number Z is 3, mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Energy in particle physics usually refers to kinetic energy or total energy. Wait, the question says "the energy of RHIC" so I think it's the kinetic energy, or maybe the total energy. Hmm, but in colliders, the energy is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, no—sometimes the total energy is considered. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So it's the energy each nucleus has when moving at 0.96c. So probably, it's the total energy, because the kinetic energy is a part of the total energy.

Wait, but wait a second. In particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm. I might have to think about the formula.

So, the energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c^2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if the speed v is 0.96c, then gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, let's compute gamma. Let me compute (0.96)^2: 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is
