Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the problem is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the compound has a six-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably benzene-based but with substitutions. It's di-substituted, meaning two substituents on the ring. The total of 8 carbons in the compound. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents contribute 2 more carbons. But wait, wait. Let me think: each substituent could add a certain number of carbons. For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, that's one substituent. The other substituent might be something else.

The IR shows a carbonyl group. So the substituents include a carbonyl (C=O). Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, which means one of the substituents is a halogenâ€”probably a chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Wait, but how does that fit with the substituent count?

Wait, no. An aromatic ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. So, two substituents: O=C-R and X (like Cl, Br). But wait, no, wait. The substituents are either groups attached to the ring. For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an aldehyde), but wait, in benzene rings, carbonyl substituents are usually in the form of ketones (like a benzophenone group) or maybe esters or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group as part of another substituent.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde group, which is a CHO substituent. But CHO is a substituent that's a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone like a benzyl ketone, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the substituent possibilities.

Wait, considering the molecular formula. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must add
