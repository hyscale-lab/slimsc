Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent, right? Oh yeah, in polar aprotic solvents, the order is usually based on the basicity of the nucleophiles because they're not as solvated. But wait, this question is about aqueous solution, which is a protic solvent. So I think the solvation plays a big role here.

The given nucleophiles are: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. I need to arrange them from most reactive (most nucleophilic) to least reactive.

Wait, I think in aqueous solution, the strength of the nucleophile is inversely related to how well it's solvated. Strong bases are stabilized by solvation, which makes them less nucleophilic in solution. But wait, that depends on the solvent's ability to stabilize the charge. So in water, the more stabilized the nucleophile (stronger base), the less reactive it is as a nucleophile.

So first, I should list the nucleophiles and their corresponding bases or conjugate acids. Because stronger bases are better nucleophiles generally, but in a protic solvent, solvation can reduce their nucleophilicity.

Let me think about each one:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. The cyclohexanol is a relatively strong base, but the substituent (4-methyl) might influence the stability of the conjugate base. Wait, the base strength depends on the stability of the conjugate acid. If the conjugate acid is more stable, the base is stronger. But I'm not sure about this one compared to others. Maybe it's a strong base since it's an alkoxide.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): This is a strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's highly solvated, so maybe its nucleophilicity is reduced.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): The conjugate base of propionic acid. Propionic acid is a weaker acid than acetic acid, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propionic acid is a stronger acid than acetic? No, wait, wait. No, formic is stronger than acetic, which is stronger than propionic? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, actually, the strength of the acid increases with the stability of the conjugate base. So longer chains have more stabilization through resonance and inductive effects. Wait, propionate's conjugate acid is propionic acid. Wait, comparing to acetic acid, which is weaker than propionic acid? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: For the series, in carboxylic acids, the strength increases as the stability of the conjugate base increases. So, formic acid is stronger than acetic, which is stronger than propionic. Because in formate, there's more resonance stabilization. So propionic acid is weaker than acetic, meaning propionate is a weaker base than acetate. Hmm.

Wait, but nucleophilicity in aqueous solution for the conjugate bases would be opposite of their basicity? Or does the solvation affect it? Because stronger bases are more stabilized (solvated) in water, which reduces their nucleophilicity.

Wait, so if a conjugate base is stronger (like OH⁻ is stronger than propionate), then in a protic solvent, its nucleophilicity would be lower because it's more solvated. So maybe the order of nucleophilicity isn't just the same as the order of basicity.

Let me list the nucleophiles with their basicity:

Ethanethiolate (CH3S⁻): Thiolate ions are stronger bases than the corresponding hydroxide ions because S is less electronegative than O, so the thiolate is a weaker base? Wait, wait, no. Actually, I think that thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide ions. Because the S-H bond is weaker, so the thiolate ion is a stronger base than OH⁻. Oh wait, but wait, in aqueous solution, the thiolate is more stabilized because S is larger and can be solvated better. Hmm, but in terms of basicity in water, I think that HS⁻ is a weaker acid than H2O (since pKa of H2O is around 15.7, and HS⁻ has a pKa around 7). Wait, no, HS⁻ is the conjugate base of H2S (pKa around 7). Wait, no, HS⁻ is the conjugate base of H2S, which has a pKa of about 7. So, H2O has a pKa of about 15.7. So, the basicity order is: HS⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻) because H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. Wait no, wait: If HA is a stronger acid, then A⁻ is a weaker base. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O (pKa ~7 vs ~15.7), so S²⁻ or HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The conjugate base of a stronger acid is weaker. So, H2S is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O. So, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻ (which is the same as ethanethiolate, CH3S⁻? Or wait, ethanethiolate is CH3S⁻, which is the conjugate base of CH3SH. The pKa of CH3SH is around 10. So, CH3SH is a weaker acid than H2O (pKa ~15.7), so CH3S⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, if the acid (HA) has a higher pKa, it's a weaker acid. For example, HCl (pKa ~-8) is a strong acid, its conjugate base Cl⁻ is weak. H2O has a pKa ~15.7, so H2O is a weak acid, its conjugate base (OH⁻) is strong.

So, comparing HS⁻ and CH3S⁻: What are their conjugate acids? HS⁻ is the conjugate base of H2S (pKa ~7). CH3S⁻ is the conjugate base of CH3SH, which has a pKa around 10. So, because CH3SH is a weaker acid (higher pKa) than H2S, CH3S⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻. So, ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide? No, because OH⁻ is a stronger base than CH3S⁻. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me clarify:

Conjugate acid of OH⁻ is H2O (pKa ~15.7). Conjugate acid of CH3S⁻ is CH3SH (pKa ~10). Since CH3SH is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, its conjugate base CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base than CH3S⁻. Oh, I see, so the order is OH⁻ > CH3S⁻ in terms of basicity.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, a lower pKa means a stronger acid. So H2O has pKa ~15.7, CH3SH has pKa ~10. So CH3SH is a stronger acid than H2O. Therefore, CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, in terms of basicity, OH⁻ is a stronger base. So, in aqueous solution, OH⁻ is more stabilized (solvated) than CH3S⁻? Wait, no. Wait, in a polar protic solvent, the ability to solvate is based on how well the ion can be surrounded by solvent molecules. Larger and less electronegative ions are better solvated. CH3S⁻ is a larger ion than OH⁻, so maybe it's less solvated? Or is it the opposite? Hmm.

Wait, I think in polar protic solvents, the ion's size and charge affect solvation. For example, I⁻ is larger and less electronegative than F⁻, so it's less solvated and more nucleophilic. So, perhaps CH3S⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻ because it's larger. So, even though OH⁻ is a stronger base, in a protic solvent, its nucleophilicity is hindered by strong solvation. So CH3S⁻ might be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, let me think again. The general trend is that in protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order is opposite to basicity because the stronger bases are more solvated. So, in aqueous solution, the weaker base is a better nucleophile. So, between OH⁻ and CH3S⁻, since OH⁻ is a stronger base (so more solvated), it's a poorer nucleophile in aqueous solution. Whereas CH3S⁻ is a weaker base (so less solvated), making it a better nucleophile in water.

So, CH3S⁻ (ethanethiolate) is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, but I thought OH⁻ is a stronger base. So, in a polar aprotic solvent, the order would be OH⁻ > CH3S⁻ in nucleophilicity, but in polar protic, it's the opposite: CH3S⁻ is a better nucleophile.

Okay, moving on.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule, not an ion. So, as a nucleophile, it's less reactive because it doesn't have a charge. Wait, but in aqueous solution, it's less nucleophilic than ions because it's not as stabilized, but as a molecule, it's a weaker nucleophile. So, I think it's one of the weakest in this list.

5. Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻): The conjugate base of propionic acid. As I thought earlier, propionic acid is a weaker acid than acetic acid. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, formic acid (pKa ~2.3) is stronger than acetic (pKa ~4.76), which is stronger than propionic (pKa ~4.88). Wait, no, wait: The pKa of propionic acid is about 4.88, which is higher than acetic acid's 4.76. So, acetic acid is stronger than propionic acid. So, the propionate ion is a weaker base than acetate. So, acetate (if present) would be a better nucleophile in a protic solvent than propionate. But in our case, the nucleophiles are propionate and others.

So, the propionate ion is less basic than the acetate ion, but how does that affect its nucleophilicity in aqueous solution? Since it's a weaker base, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile. Wait, but I'm getting confused again.

Wait, in aqueous solution, the stronger the base, the more it's solvated, making it less reactive as a nucleophile. So, the order of nucleophilicity would be the reverse of their basicity, but only considering how much they're solvated.

So, if we have a list of nucleophiles in aqueous solution, their nucleophilicity order is determined by their ability to avoid solvation. So, the weaker the base, the less solvated, the more nucleophilic.

Let me arrange the nucleophiles by their basicity strength (strongest to weakest):

Ethanethiolate (CH3S⁻) is weaker base than OH⁻? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, earlier I thought OH⁻ is stronger base than CH3S⁻. Because H2O has a higher pKa than CH3SH.

Wait, no, wait. The pKa of CH3SH is about 10, and the pKa of H2O is about 15.7. So, CH3SH is a stronger acid than H2O. Therefore, CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base than CH3S⁻.

So, ordering the nucleophiles by basicity (strongest to weakest):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Its conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. The pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19-20. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol might have a lower pKa due to steric effects? Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you have bulky groups near the OH, it can stabilize the conjugate acid (the alcohol) better, making it more acidic. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol is less acidic than cyclohexanol? Or more?

Wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is in a chair conformation, and the OH is in a less hindered position. Adding a methyl group at the 4-position (which is axial or equatorial?) would affect the acidity. Wait, if the methyl is in a position that makes the leaving of the proton easier, the acid would be stronger. Alternatively, if the conjugate base is more stabilized, the acid is stronger.

Wait, in 4-methylcyclohexanol, the methyl group is probably in an equatorial position, so the conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) would have a less stable structure because the negative charge is on an already substituted cyclohexane ring. Wait, I'm not too sure about this. But assuming that 4-methylcyclohexanol is less acidic than, say, phenol, but more than ethanol. Wait, but ethanol has a pKa of around 16. Hmmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the relative strengths of the bases of these nucleophiles. Let's list them:

- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. I think the pKa is around 19.5 or something like that. So, the conjugate base is a strong base.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19-20, so its conjugate base is a stronger base than, say, propionate, which is a weaker base (since propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88, so propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide, which is a stronger base than propionate).

Wait, no. Wait, the stronger the acid, the weaker the base. So, propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is stronger than H2O (pKa ~15.7). So, propionate (A⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order of strength from strongest to weakest base (and thus, strongest nucleophile in aprotic solvent, but maybe not in aqueous):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base)
2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻; strong base)
3. Ethanethiolate (CH3S⁻; weaker base than OH⁻, as discussed)
4. Propionate (weaker base than OH⁻)
5. Methanol (neutral, weakest as a nucleophile)

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because earlier, I thought that OH⁻ is a stronger base than CH3S⁻. So, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's the strongest base here.

So, the order of basicity (strongest to weakest):

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > CH3S⁻ > propionate > methanol.

Wait, but wait, CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, it's not the third; it's after OH⁻.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me reorganize.

Wait, the pKa of H2O is 15.7, so OH⁻ is its conjugate base. The pKa of CH3SH is around 10, so CH3S⁻ is the conjugate base. So, since CH3SH is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, its conjugate base CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, the order is OH⁻ (stronger base) > CH3S⁻ (weaker base).

So, the order of the given nucleophiles in terms of basicity (strongest to weakest) is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (conj. acid pKa ~ ~19.5?)
2. OH⁻ (pKa 15.7)
3. CH3S⁻ (pKa 10)
4. Propionate (pKa ~4.88)
5. Methanol (pKa ~19.2 for its conjugate acid, CH3OH's own conjugate acid is CH3O⁻ + H+? Wait, no. Wait, methanol is CH3OH, which is a weak acid with pKa ~19.2. So, its conjugate base (CH3O⁻) is strong, but in this case, the nucleophile is CH3OH itself, which is neutral. So, its nucleophilicity is low because it's not charged.

Wait, so in the given list:

- 1: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
- 2: OH⁻ (strong base)
- 5: CH3S⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻)
- 3: propionate (weaker base than CH3S⁻)
- 4: methanol (neutral, weakest as a nucleophile)

So, the order of basicity is 1 > 2 >5 >3 >4.

But in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the base because stronger bases are more solvated. So, the weakest base would be the best nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be the reverse of basicity: 4 (weakest base, so best nucleophile) < 3 <5 <2 <1?

Wait, no. Wait, the more a nucleophile is solvated, the less reactive it is. Stronger bases are more solvated, so their nucleophilicity is reduced. So, the order of nucleophilicity in protic solvents (like water) is from weakest base to strongest base.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. For example, in a protic solvent, the nucleophilicity order is often: iodide > bromide > chloride > fluoride. Because F⁻ is a stronger base and is more solvated, so it's a worse nucleophile in aqueous solution. So, in that case, the weakest base (I⁻) is the best nucleophile.

So, applying that to our list, the weakest base is methanol (4), then propionate (3), then CH3S⁻ (5), then OH⁻ (2), then 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1). But wait, no, because 4 is methanol, which is neutral. So, the actual order of nucleophilicity in water would be:

Weakest base (best nucleophile) → strongest base (worst nucleophile)

But wait, wait: in a protic solvent, the best nucleophiles are the ones that are less stabilized (less solvated). So, for the given nucleophiles, their order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be: methanol (neutral; no charge, so not solvated as much; but it's a poor nucleophile because it's not charged) → propionate → ethanethiolate → hydroxide → 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because methanol is neutral. Neutral molecules can't donate electrons as effectively as charged species, so maybe it's the weakest nucleophile here.

Wait, but let me think: in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is generally I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. So, the weaker bases are better nucleophiles. Because F⁻ is a stronger base (high charge density, so more solvated) than I⁻.

So, applying that logic, the order of nucleophilicity for the given nucleophiles (weakest base first, so best nucleophile) would be:

Methanol (4) → propionate (3) → ethanethiolate (5) → hydroxide (2) → 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).

Wait, but wait: CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's less solvated, more nucleophilic than OH⁻. So, the order would be: 4 (Methanol, neutral) <3 (propionate⁻) <5 (CH3S⁻) <2 (OH⁻) <1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate).

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. Because in the case of iodide vs. fluoride, iodide is a weaker base and a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, in our case, the weakest base is methanol (neutral), but since it's neutral, it's a poor nucleophile. Then the next weakest base is propionate, then CH3S⁻, then OH⁻, then 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.

But wait, another approach: in a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity follows basicity. But in a polar protic solvent, the opposite occurs because of solvation.

So, in aqueous solution (protic), the order of nucleophilicity is the reverse of their basicity.

So, the order of basicity (strongest to weakest) is:

1 >2 >5 >3 >4.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is:

4 <3 <5 <2 <1.

Wait, no. If the order is reverse, then the weakest base is the best nucleophile. So:

4 (weakest base, but neutral) → 3 (propionate, weaker base than 5) →5 (weaker base than 2) →2 (weaker base than 1) →1 (strongest base, worst nucleophile).

But wait, no, because 5 is CH3S⁻, which is a weaker base than 2 (OH⁻). So, in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, 5 would be a better nucleophile than 2 because it's a weaker base.

Wait, but how does the order look: the weakest base is methanol (4), next is propionate (3), then CH3S⁻ (5), then OH⁻ (2), then 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).

So, from best to worst nucleophilicity in water:

4 (methanol) <3 (propionate) <5 (ethanethiolate) <2 (hydroxide) <1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate).

But wait, methanol is a neutral molecule; it's a poor nucleophile compared to the anions. So, maybe the order starts with CH3S⁻ (5) as the best, then OH⁻ (2), then propionate (3), then 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), and methanol (4) is the worst.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself in a knot. Let me try a different approach.

List of nucleophiles and their approximate pKa of conjugate acids:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Its pKa is around 19.5.
2. OH⁻: conjugate acid H2O, pKa ~15.7.
5. CH3S⁻: conjugate acid CH3SH, pKa ~10.
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻): conjugate acid propionic acid, pKa ~4.88.
4. Methanol (CH3OH): pKa ~19.2 (since CH3OH's own conjugate acid is CH3O⁻ + H+? Wait, no, the pKa is for CH3OH donating a proton to become CH3O⁻. So, the pKa of CH3OH is ~19.2.

So, the order of strength of the conjugate acids (from strongest to weakest):

5. CH3SH (pKa 10) → strongest acid
3. Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) → next
2. H2O (pKa 15.7) → Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no: H2O has a pKa of ~15.7, which is weaker acid than propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So, the stronger acid is propionic acid. So, the order is:

5. CH3SH (pKa 10) → strongest acid
3. Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) → stronger than H2O
2. H2O (pKa 15.7) → weaker than propionic acid
1. 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5) → weaker acid than H2O
4. Methanol (pKa ~19.2) → weaker acid than 4-methylcyclohexanol? Wait, no. Methanol's pKa is ~19.2, 4-methylcyclohexanol's is ~19.5. So, methanol is a weaker acid than 4-methylcyclohexanol.

So, the conjugate acids in order of strength (strongest first):

5. CH3SH (pKa 10) → strongest
3. Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88)
2. H2O (pKa ~15.7)
4. Methanol (pKa ~19.2)
1. 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5) → weakest acid.

So, the conjugate bases (nucleophiles) from weakest to strongest base:

5. CH3S⁻ (weakest base, since CH3SH is strongest acid)
3. Propionate (weaker base than CH3S⁻)
2. OH⁻ (weaker base than propionate? No, wait: H2O has pKa 15.7, propionic acid ~4.88. So, propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻? No, because a weaker acid's conjugate base is stronger. H2O is a weaker acid than propionic acid, so OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me think differently.

The conjugate base strength is inversely proportional to the strength of the conjugate acid. So, the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base.

So, the conjugate acids from strongest to weakest:

CH3SH (pKa 10) > propionic acid (4.88) > H2O (15.7) > methanol (19.2) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.5).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because higher pKa means weaker acid. So, propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is a stronger acid than H2O (pKa ~15.7). So, the order of conjugate acid strengths is:

5. CH3SH (pKa 10) → strongest
3. Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) → next
2. H2O (pKa ~15.7) → weaker
4. Methanol (pKa ~19.2) → weaker
1. 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5) → weakest.

Wait, but that can't be right because 19.5 is higher than 19.2, meaning 4-methylcyclohexanol is a weaker acid than methanol. So, the order of acid strengths is:

5. CH3SH (pKa 10) → strongest
3. Propionic acid (pKa 4.88) → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa 19.5) → weaker than methanol?
Wait, no. Methanol's pKa is ~19.2, which is weaker than 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa of ~19.5. Because a lower pKa means a stronger acid. So, methanol is a stronger acid than 4-methylcyclohexanol. So, the conjugate base of methanol (CH3O⁻) is weaker than that of 4-methylcyclohexanol.

Wait, perhaps I should make a table:

| Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid | pKa of Conjugate Acid | Strength of Conjugate Acid | Strength of Nucleophile as Base |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1           | 4-MeCyclohexanol | ~19.5                | Weak acid                    | Strong base                     |
| 2           | H2O             | ~15.7                | Weak acid                    | Strong base                     |
| 5           | CH3SH           | ~10                  | Strong acid                  | Weak base                       |
| 3           | Propionic acid  | ~4.88                | Strong acid                  | Weak base                       |
| 4           | CH3OH           | ~19.2                | Weak acid                    | Weak base                       |

Wait, so the conjugate acid strengths: 5 >3 >4 >2 >1. Because CH3SH (pKa 10) > propionic (4.88) > methanol (19.2) is incorrect. Wait, no, CH3SH has pKa 10, which is weaker than propionic (4.88). So, propionic acid is stronger than CH3SH. Wait, no, wait: a lower pKa is a stronger acid. So, propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is stronger than CH3SH (pKa ~10), which in turn is stronger than H2O (pKa ~15.7), stronger than methanol (pKa ~19.2), stronger than 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5).

So, conjugate acid strength order: 3 >5 >2 >4 >1.

Thus, the strength of the nucleophiles as bases (from strongest to weakest) is the reverse: 1 >4 >2 >5 >3. Wait, no, because the weaker the conjugate acid, the stronger the base.

Wait, the strength of the nucleophile as a base is inversely proportional to the pKa of the conjugate acid. So, higher pKa (weaker acid) → stronger base.

So, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa 19.5) → strongest base.

Then methanol's conjugate base (pKa 19.2) → weaker than 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Then OH⁻ (pKa 15.7) → stronger than next.

Then CH3S⁻ (pKa 10) → weaker than OH⁻.

Then propionate (pKa 4.88) → weakest base.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanol has a higher pKa (weaker acid) than methanol, so its conjugate base is stronger.

So, the order of base strength (strongest to weakest) is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa 19.5)
4. Methanol's conjugate base (CH3O⁻; pKa 19.2)
2. OH⁻ (pKa 15.7)
5. CH3S⁻ (pKa 10)
3. Propionate (pKa 4.88)

Wait, but in our list, the nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. OH⁻ (strong base)
5. CH3S⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻)
3. Propionate (weaker than CH3S⁻)
4. Methanol (neutral, weakest as a nucleophile)

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should refer to general trends.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for similar nucleophiles is:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (because F⁻ is most basic and more solvated)

So, applying that, weaker bases are better nucleophiles in aqueous solution.

So, among the given nucleophiles, which are weaker bases?

Methanol is neutral (weakest base), then propionate (pKa ~4.88), then CH3S⁻ (pKa ~10), then OH⁻ (pKa ~15.7), then 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa ~19.5).

Wait, no, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate has a higher pKa (weaker acid), so it's a stronger base.

So, the order of base strength (strongest to weakest):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. OH⁻
5. CH3S⁻
3. Propionate
4. Methanol

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity (weakest base first, strongest base last) would be:

Methanol (4) → Propionate (3) → CH3S⁻ (5) → OH⁻ (2) → 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1).

But again, methanol is neutral, so it's a poor nucleophile. So, the actual order might have CH3S⁻ as the best nucleophile, followed by OH⁻, then propionate, then 4-MeCyclohexanolate, and methanol is the worst.

Wait, no. Because CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order from best to worst nucleophilicity in water is:

5 (CH3S⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but I'm not sure about propionate vs. 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which is stronger than CH3S⁻. So, in aqueous solution, their nucleophilicity would be CH3S⁻ > OH⁻ > propionate > 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base, it's more solvated, making it less nucleophilic. So, in aqueous solution, propionate would be a better nucleophile than 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, but I'm getting myself stuck. Let me try to list all the nucleophiles with their expected nucleophilicity in aqueous solution from best to worst.

The order should be from weakest base to strongest base, because in aqueous solution, weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So, weakest base (best nucleophile) → strongest base (worst nucleophile).

The given nucleophiles' bases' strength order is:

1. 4-MeCyclohexanolate (strongest base)
2. OH⁻
5. CH3S⁻
3. Propionate
4. Methanol (neutral, weakest base as a nucleophile)

Wait, no. Wait, the strength as bases is 1 >2 >5 >3 >4.

So, in aqueous solution, their nucleophilicity order is the opposite: 4 <3 <5 <2 <1. But that can't be correct because methanol is neutral and thus a poor nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of solvation.

Which of these nucleophiles is the least solvated?

CH3S⁻ is a larger ion than OH⁻, so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order would be:

Methanol (4) is neutral → poor nucleophile.

Then, propionate (3) → anion, less basic than CH3S⁻.

Wait, no, propionate is weaker base than CH3S⁻, so more nucleophilic. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

Because CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so less solvated and better nucleophile. Then comes OH⁻, which is more solvated but a stronger base. Then propionate, which is weaker than CH3S⁻, so less solvated than CH3S⁻ but more than OH⁻? No, I'm getting tangled.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

From best to worst nucleophilicity in aqueous solution:

5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so more solvated, worse nucleophile. So, OH⁻ should be better than 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, no, because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base, more solvated, and thus worse nucleophile.

So, the order would be:

5 (CH3S⁻) is the best nucleophile (weakest base), then 2 (OH⁻), then 3 (propionate), then 1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate), and 4 (methanol) is the worst.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻?

No, because propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, which is weaker than OH⁻. So, propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻, so in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself into a tangle. Let me try to list each nucleophile's position.

1. 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate: strongest base → most solvated → worst nucleophile in aqueous.

2. OH⁻: strong base → highly solvated → poor nucleophile.

5. CH3S⁻: weaker base than OH⁻ → less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

3. Propionate: weaker base than CH3S⁻ → better nucleophile than CH3S⁻.

Wait, no. Because propionate's conjugate acid has a lower pKa (stronger acid) than CH3S⁻, so propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because a weaker base is less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous should be:

Weakest base → best nucleophile.

So, 3 (propionate) is a weaker base than 5 (CH3S⁻), so propionate is a better nucleophile than CH3S⁻.

Wait, no. Because the conjugate acid of propionate (propionic acid) has a lower pKa (stronger acid) than CH3SH. Wait, CH3SH has pKa ~10, propionic acid pKa ~4.88. So, propionic acid is a stronger acid than CH3SH. Thus, propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻. So, propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, meaning it's a better nucleophile in aqueous.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: if HA is a stronger acid (lower pKa), then A⁻ is a weaker base. So, propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is a stronger acid than CH3SH (pKa ~10), so propionate (A⁻) is a weaker base than CH3S⁻. Therefore, in aqueous solution, propionate is a better nucleophile than CH3S⁻.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Methanol (neutral) → propionate → CH3S⁻ → OH⁻ → 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate.

Wait, but that can't be right because CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so CH3S⁻ should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So, the order would be:

Methanol < propionate < CH3S⁻ < OH⁻ < 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

No, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because if the order is reverse of base strength, the weakest base is the best nucleophile.

Wait, the correct order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is from weakest to strongest base.

Wait, no. Because in protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the basicity due to solvation. So, the weakest base is the best nucleophile.

So, the list of nucleophiles from weakest base to strongest base is:

Methanol (4) → propionate (3) → CH3S⁻ (5) → OH⁻ (2) → 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate (1).

Thus, their nucleophilicity in water is from best to worst:

4 (methanol) <3 (propionate) <5 (CH3S⁻) <2 (OH⁻) <1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate).

But wait, methanol is neutral. So, the actual nucleophilicity order in water should be:

5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, no. Because CH3S⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻, thus more nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a table or a general trend. I remember that in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common anions is:

I⁻ > RO⁻ (if R is large, like alkyl groups) > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻.

But in this case, the nucleophiles are different.

Wait, another approach: in a polar protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity follows the trend where bulky, less solvated nucleophiles are better.

So, among the given options, the largest nucleophile is 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, but it's a strong base, so it's highly solvated, making it a poor nucleophile.

The smallest, highly charged nucleophile would be OH⁻, which is highly solvated, so poor nucleophile.

The less solvated (due to size) would be CH3S⁻, followed by propionate.

Wait, but propionate is a larger ion than CH3S⁻?

No, propionate is a larger anion (CH2CH2COO⁻) compared to CH3S⁻. So, perhaps propionate is more solvated than CH3S⁻, making CH3S⁻ a better nucleophile.

So, the order would be:

CH3S⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > propionate (3) > 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate (1) > methanol (4).

But I'm not confident. Let's look at the options given.

Options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3

D) 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Wait, the options are presented as a sequence, but I'm not sure of the exact order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 5, 2, 3, 1,4 → nucleophilicity order is 5 (CH3S⁻) first, then 2 (OH⁻), then 3 (propionate), then 1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate), then 4 (methanol).

Option D: 5, 2, 1,3,4 → 5 first, 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, but according to our analysis, the order should be 5 >2 >3 >1 >4.

Looking at the options, option A is 5,2,3,1,4, which fits this order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5 >2 >1 >3 >4.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is to arrange them from more reactive to least reactive (most reactive to poorest).

So, the correct order from most to least reactive in aqueous solution would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > Propionate (3) > 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another way: think about the S N2 reactivity. In aqueous solution, the better nucleophiles are the ones less solvated.

Ethanethiolate (CH3S⁻) is less solvated than OH⁻ because it's a larger ion with lower charge density. So, in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile.

Then comes OH⁻, but it's more solvated, so less reactive.

Next, 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so more solvated, worse nucleophile.

Wait, that can't be right because 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so more solvated, less nucleophilic.

So, after OH⁻, the next would be 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate. Then propionate, which is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, so better nucleophile than 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate?

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate) >4 (methanol).

This would correspond to option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4.

So, the order is: 5 >2 >3 >1 >4.

That would mean CH3S⁻ > OH⁻ > propionate > 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate > methanol.

Does that make sense? Because:

- CH3S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ → better nucleophile.

- OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate → propionate is less basic, more nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻ but stronger than OH⁻?

Wait, no, earlier analysis said propionate is weaker than CH3S⁻.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the pKa's.

Propionate's conjugate acid (propionic acid) has pKa ~4.88.

CH3S⁻'s conjugate acid (CH3SH) has pKa ~10.

So, propionic acid is a stronger acid than CH3SH → propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻.

Thus, in aqueous solution, propionate is a better nucleophile than CH3S⁻ because it's a weaker base and less solvated.

Wait, that can't be right. If propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

So, CH3S⁻ is a stronger base than propionate → more solvated → worse nucleophile.

Thus, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is:

propionate (3) > CH3S⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate (1) > methanol (4).

Wait, that would be the order because propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, which is weaker than OH⁻, which is weaker than 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: looking for a mnemonic or rule.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common anions is generally: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. So, the weaker the base, the better the nucleophile.

Applying that, among the given nucleophiles, the weakest base should be the best nucleophile.

The given nucleophiles in order of their conjugate acid's pKa (from strongest to weakest acid):

5. CH3SH (pKa 10)
3. Propionic acid (pKa 4.88)
2. H2O (pKa 15.7)
4. Methanol (pKa 19.2)
1. 4-MeCyclohexanol (pKa 19.5)

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because CH3SH (pKa 10) is weaker acid than propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So, propionic acid is stronger than CH3SH.

So, the order of conjugate acids (strongest to weakest):

3. Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88)
5. CH3SH (pKa ~10)
2. H2O (pKa ~15.7)
4. Methanol (pKa ~19.2)
1. 4-MeCyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5)

Thus, the order of the strength of the conjugate bases (nucleophiles) is the opposite:

1. 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
4. Methanol's conjugate base (CH3O⁻; but methanol is neutral, so not a strong base)
2. OH⁻
5. CH3S⁻
3. Propionate.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (weakest base first) is:

3 (propionate) →5 (CH3S⁻) →2 (OH⁻) →1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate) →4 (methanol).

But methanol is neutral, so it's the worst nucleophile.

Wait, but propionate is a weaker base than CH3S⁻, so it's a better nucleophile.

Thus, the order is:

3 (propionate) >5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate) >4 (methanol).

But looking at the options provided, none of them match this order.

The options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4 → 5>2>3>1>4.

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → 2>5>1>4>3.

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → 2>5>3>4>3 (doesn't make sense; duplicates).

D)5,2,1,3,4 →5>2>1>3>4.

None of these match the order I thought (3>5>2>1>4).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me try to recount.

Another approach: in aqueous solution, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it is. So, larger ions are better nucleophiles in protic solvents because they're less solvated.

So, 4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate is a large, bulky base → but strong base → highly solvated → poor nucleophile.

CH3S⁻ is a larger ion than OH⁻ → less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Propionate is a larger ion than CH3S⁻ → perhaps more solvated → worse nucleophile than CH3S⁻.

Wait, but propionate is a larger anion than CH3S⁻, but in terms of solvation, larger ions are better solvated. So, propionate is more solvated than CH3S⁻.

So, CH3S⁻ is less solvated → better nucleophile than propionate.

Thus, the order would be:

5 (CH3S⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >3 (propionate) >1 (4-MeCyclohexan-1-olate) >4 (methanol).

Which matches option A: 5,2,3,1,4.

So, the answer should be option A.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we analyze their basicity and solvation effects. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity often inversely correlates with basicity due to solvation: stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. Additionally, larger, less solvated ions tend to be better nucleophiles in aqueous solutions.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: This is a strong base due to the destabilization of its conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~19.5). However, as a strong base, it is highly solvated in water, making it a poor nucleophile.
2. **Hydroxide (2)**: A strong base with a pKa of ~15.7 for its conjugate acid (H₂O). It is highly solvated in water, reducing its nucleophilicity compared to weaker bases.
3. **Propionate (3)**: A weaker base than hydroxide, as its conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a lower pKa (~4.88). This makes it less solvated and more nucleophilic than hydroxide.
4. **Methanol (4)**: A neutral molecule, making it a poor nucleophile compared to charged species. Its nucleophilicity is minimal in aqueous solution.
5. **Ethanethiolate (5)**: A weaker base than hydroxide, as its conjugate acid (CH₃SH) has a lower pKa (~10). Ethanethiolate is less solvated than hydroxide due to its larger size and lower charge density, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

### Order of Nucleophilicity in Aqueous Solution:
From the analysis, the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution is determined by the balance of basicity and solvation:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)**: Least solvated and a weaker base, making it the most nucleophilic.
- **Hydroxide (2)**: A stronger base than ethanethiolate but more solvated, making it the second most nucleophilic.
- **Propionate (3)**: A weaker base than hydroxide but more solvated than ethanethiolate, making it the third most nucleophilic.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: A strong base but highly solvated, making it the fourth most nucleophilic.
- **Methanol (4)**: Neutral and poorly nucleophilic, making it the least nucleophilic.

### Correct Option:
The correct order of nucleophilicity is **5 > 2 > 3 > 1 > 4**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
