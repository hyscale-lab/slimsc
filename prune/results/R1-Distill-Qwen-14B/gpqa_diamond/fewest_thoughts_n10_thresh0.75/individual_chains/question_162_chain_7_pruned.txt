Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the area of a pseudosphere using a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through step by step.

First, the metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric in flat space, but scaled by some factor. Oh right, this is probably a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe a sphere or something else.

The question is asking for the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, pseudosphere is more of a specific shape, but in general, the term can refer to surfaces with a constant negative curvature. So that might tie into hyperbolic geometry.

Looking at the metric, let's see. The general form of a metric on a 2D surface is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). Here, the function g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat, meaning it's a scaling of the Euclidean metric. That makes things easier because the area element is just the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. But since it's conformally flat, the determinant is g(x,y), and the square root is sqrt(g). So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy
