Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me see. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, I remember that the structure of these compounds affects the splitting and number of signals in the NMR.

Let me look at the NMR data given: 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). 

First, acetates usually have an ester functional group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R'. Wait, no, the structure is more like CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So the ester group is present, which means the O is connected to the R group.

Looking at the NMR peaks. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely from the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, so that's the acetate part. Then the other signals come from the R group.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling. Because in alkenes, the coupling between vicinal protons (on adjacent carbons) is usually around 10-18 Hz, so 16 is in that range. Also, in an ester, the protons adjacent to the oxygen (the alpha protons) might couple with each other.

Wait, but if the R group is a propenyl or butenyl, it will have a double bond. Let's consider the possible structures.

For propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but depending on the position of the double bond.

Wait, no. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH3CH=CH2? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms
