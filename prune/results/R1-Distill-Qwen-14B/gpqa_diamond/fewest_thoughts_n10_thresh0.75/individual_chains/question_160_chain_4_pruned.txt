Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a large N-sided polygon. Hmm, alright, let's break it down.

The question says that the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. 

Wait, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So all apothems being the same length 'a' means that each side is at a distance 'a' from the center. And since it's a regular polygon, all sides are equal in length.

When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a smooth circle. So in the case of a circular aperture, we know the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk. The first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a). Wait, no, wait. The formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction is sinθ = (1.22) λ/(diameter). But wait, the diameter of the circle would be 2a, since the apothem is 'a' — wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait: for a circle, the apothem is the radius. Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a circle is just the radius. So the radius r is 'a'. So the diameter is 2a. So the formula for the first minimum in a circular aperture is sinθ = (1.22) λ/(2a). But wait, the question is about when N approaches infinity, so the polygon becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. The options given don't have 1.22, but option C is 1.220 λ/a. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. No, wait. The formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction (which is similar to circular aperture diffraction) is sinθ = (1.22) λ/(d), where d is the diameter. So if the apothem is 'a', the diameter is 2a. So sinθ = (1.22 λ)/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. So θ is approximately 0.61 λ/a, assuming small angles where sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, no. Wait, the first minimum is the first dark spot after the central maximum. Then the second minimum would be the next dark ring. But wait, in circular apertures, the minima occur at certain angles. The positions are given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum after the central maximum is at θ1, and the next is at θ2. The angular distance between them would be θ2 - θ1.

But wait, for a circular aperture, the minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first zero occurs at x ≈ 3.8317, which corresponds to θ1 = (λ/a)(x)/(π), so θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) * λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a. Wait, no, wait. Let's get that right. The formula is a sinθ = (x) λ/(2a), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula for the minima in single-slit (or circular) diffraction is a sinθ = x λ/(2a), where x
