Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think it through.

The question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light. The spacecraft is going at 0.99999987*c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Oh right, and the options are given, but I should figure it out step by step.

Wait, the problem mentions that the aliens have an average lifetime of 150 solar years. So, if the trip takes longer than that, the astronaut might not survive. But let's get into the physics.

I remember that when you travel at speeds close to light speed, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is when time passes slower for the moving observer compared to a stationary one. So, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip would take less time than someone watching from Earth would perceive.

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, from Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving fast, so the distance is contracted. From the spaceship's frame, the distance is shorter, so the time taken is less.

Alternatively, using time dilation, the proper time (the time experienced by the astronaut) is given by the Lorentz transformation. The formula is tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²), or more accurately, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait. I think I got that a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. The proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, so tau is the astronaut's time. The Earth frame time (t) is longer than tau because of the time dilation effect.

But wait, to compute the time from the astronaut's perspective, I need to find the proper time. Proper time is the shortest time between two events (like departure and arrival) in the frame where those events happen at the same place. But in this case, the spaceship is moving, so from Earth's perspective, the distance is contracted, and the time is longer. Wait, no, no. Let me be precise.

The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a significant factor here. How far away is the LMC? I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But wait, the exact distance may not be given in the problem, so maybe the speed is so high that the time in the astronaut's frame is manageable.

Wait, the problem says to find the time from the astronaut's perspective. So we can use the formula for time dilation. Let me outline the steps.

First, calculate the time it takes from Earth's perspective. Then, apply the Lorentz factor to find the astronaut's experienced time.

The time from Earth's frame would be the distance (d) divided by the speed (v). But since the astronaut is moving at v, Earth would see the distance as d = actual distance in the astronaut's frame multiplied by gamma, the Lorentz factor. Wait, no, actually, in the Earth frame, the distance is the same as the proper distance, but the spaceship is moving, so the time is d / v.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about what each frame observes.

From Earth's frame: The spaceship is moving at v, covering the distance d in time t = d / v.

From the spaceship's frame: The distance is contracted, so the distance is d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ). Therefore, the time experienced by the astronaut is t' = d' / v = (d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) / v.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the time in the spaceship's frame is the proper time.

Alternatively, using the time dilation formula, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where tau is the proper time.

So, if I can compute the time from Earth's perspective, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) to get the astronaut's time.

But wait, I don't know the exact distance between Earth and the LMC. Hmm. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So, the time from Earth's frame would be roughly d / (0.99999987c).

But without the distance, how can we compute this? Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate based on the speed, assuming that the distance is, say, the same as the distance to the LMC.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the distance in terms of light years. Because the speed is given in terms of c, so time can be in years. Let's see.

Suppose the distance between Earth and the LMC is about 160,000 light-years. Let me take that as an approximate value.

So, in Earth's frame, the time is distance / speed.

v = 0.99999987c ≈ c. So, 0.99999987 is almost 1. So, the time t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so time t (years) = distance (ly) / (v in ly/year) = d / v.

So, v is 0.99999987c, so in terms of ly/year, that's 0.99999987 (ly/year) because c is 1 ly/year.

So, t = d / (0.99999987) ≈ d * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ d * (1 + 0.00000013) approximately, using the approximation 1/(1-ε) ≈ 1 + ε for small ε.

So, for d = 160,000 ly,

t ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7 ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ ~160,000.0208 years.

But that's from Earth's frame. Then, the astronaut's time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Compute v^2/c^2: (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974. Because (1-x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small. So 0.99999987 is 1 - 2.3e-7, so squared is 1 - 2*(2.3e-7) = 1 - 4.6e-7 ≈ 0.99999954.

Wait, actually, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a² ≈ 1 - 2a when a is very small. So 2a is 2*1.3e-7 = 2.6e-7. So 0.99999987^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

Wait, because sqrt(1e-7) is about 3.16e-4. So 5.1e-4 is the square root.

So, tau ≈ t * 5.1e-4.

t is about 160,000 years, so tau ≈ 160000 * 5.1e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00051.

Calculate that:

160,000 * 0.0005 = 80.

160,000 * 0.00001 = 1.6.

So 80 + (160000 * 0.000001) = 80 + 0.16 = 80.16 ≈ 80.16 years.

Wait, but wait, that's the time experienced by the astronaut. So about 80 years.

But the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 80 = 102. But the average lifetime is about 150 years. So 102 is less than 150, so the astronaut would survive.

But wait, wait a second. The exact distance from Earth to the LMC may be different. I assumed 160,000 ly, but it's actually around 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me check more accurately.

The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me use 170,000 ly as the distance.

So, t = 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 170,000 + 170,000 * 1.3e-7.

170,000 * 1.3e-7 = 170,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0221.

t ≈ 170,000.0221 years.

Then, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 170,000.0221 * 5.1e-4.

Compute 170,000 * 5.1e-4:

170,000 * 0.00051 = (170,000 * 0.0005) + (170,000 * 0.00001) = 85 + 1.7 = 86.7 years.

Plus the 0.0221 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 0.0001137, which is negligible.

So tau is approximately 86.7 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years or D)77. Hmm, but 86.7 is not an option. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Lorentz factor more accurately, because the speed is extremely close to c, so the approximation sqrt(1 - v²/c²) might not be precise enough, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2 more accurately.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987 = ?

Let me compute 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

So, 1 - 2*1.3e-7 = 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974.

Plus (1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So, v²/c² ≈ 0.99999974.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.1e-4.

So, that part seems correct.

Wait, but wait, the distance. The problem says the astronaut is from the LMC, and they want to reach Earth. So the distance is the distance between the LMC and Earth, which is about 160,000 ly.

Wait, but when the astronaut is traveling, the distance in their frame is contracted. So the time for them is (d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) / v.

Alternatively, tau = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it that way.

So, d = 160,000 ly.

Tau = (160,000 ly) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

But since v is 0.99999987c, which is nearly c, let's compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So, tau = (160,000 ly) * (5.1e-4) / (0.99999987c).

Since v is approximately c, so 0.99999987 ≈ 1.

So, tau ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 160000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years.

Ah, that's about 81.6 years, which is close to 81 or 82 years.

Looking back at the options, option C is 81 years, option D is 77, option B is 72.

So the answer would be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 + 81 = 103 years. The average lifetime is 150 years, so he would survive.

But wait the options don't mention whether he survives, but the first option A is "The astronaut will die before reaching to Earth."

So in our calculation, 81 years, so he would be 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so he survives, so option A is incorrect, and the correct time is 81 years, so option C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation.

Compute 160,000 * 5.1e-4.

160,000 * 0.00051 = ?

160,000 * 0.0005 = 80,000 * 0.001 = 80.

160,000 * 0.00001 = 1.6.

So 0.00051 = 0.0005 + 0.00001, so 80 +1.6=81.6.

So about 81.6 years. So option C is 81, which matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is considered as 170,000 ly, but then tau would be 170,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 86.7 years, which is more than the given options. Hmm, but then the options don't have 86. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the given speed and consider that the time is 81 years.

Wait, perhaps I can check another approach.

Alternatively, from the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. The proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is L = 160,000 ly.

The contracted length is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 81.6 ly.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is L' / v.

v is 0.99999987c, so L' / v = 81.6 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ (81.6 / 0.99999987) * (ly / c).

Since ly / c is 1 year, so 81.6 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.6 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 81.6 + 0.000106 ≈ 81.6 years.

So the astronaut's time is about 81.6 years, which aligns with option C.

So the answer must be C) 81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t \)):**
   From Earth's perspective, the time taken for the journey is:
   \[
   t = \frac{d}{v}
   \]
   where \( d = 160,000 \, \text{ly} \) and \( v = 0.99999987c \). Substituting:
   \[
   t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Time Dilation Factor (\( \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \)):**
   The Lorentz factor accounts for time dilation. For \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so} \quad \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]

3. **Proper Time Experienced by the Astronaut (\( \tau \)):**
   The proper time is the time experienced by the astronaut and is given by:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( t \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \):
   \[
   \tau \approx 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Verification Using Length Contraction:**
   The contracted distance in the astronaut's frame is:
   \[
   L' = L \cdot \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{ly}.
   \]
   The time experienced by the astronaut is:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{L'}{v} \approx \frac{81.6}{0.99999987} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they will be 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth, as the trip takes about 81 years, and their lifespan is 150 years.
- **B)** Incorrect. 72 years is too short compared to the calculated 81 years.
- **C)** Correct. The astronaut's experienced time is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. 77 years is too short compared to the calculated 81 years.

Answer: C
