Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But wait, what's the effect on the expectation values of the spin components?

So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The spin is aligned with B. So the state of the spin is the eigenstate of Sz, right? Let's say it's up along Z. So the expectation value of Sz is maximum, mu_B (if we consider the Bohr magneton, but here it's given as mu = gamma * Sz. So mu would be gamma times h-bar/2 for spin 1/2.

But then the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, if the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would be zero? Or does the spin just keep its direction? Because if the field is off, there's no torque, so the spin's direction remains as it was before. But then they turn on a new magnetic field along Y. So the new magnetic field is along Y, same magnitude as before.

Wait, the initial state after the field change is the same spin state as before. So the spin is up along Z, but the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y because the field is along Y. Let's think about the Hamiltonian. The energy is -mu · B. Since mu is gamma * S, and B is along Y, the Hamiltonian H would be proportional to S_y times B.

Wait, but wait: mu is given as gamma * Sz. So the magnetic moment is along the z-component of spin. So when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu · B = - gamma * Sz * B * (unit vector in Y). Wait, no. Wait, let's be precise. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S. So if the magnetic field is along Y, then the interaction energy is H = - mu · B = - gamma (S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z). But since B is along Y, B_x and B_z are zero, B_y = B. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B, which would be H = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Now, since S_y is the spin component in the y-direction.

The spin-1/2 system in this Hamiltonian will precess around the Y-axis. The energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. The eigenvalues for H would be plus and minus (gamma B (ħ/2))? Wait, let me think. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin
