Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question describes a series of reactions, and based on those, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I think the first step is to figure out what each compound is. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What's a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio to form a red product? I'm thinking maybe a metal reacting with a halogen? Like sodium reacting with chlorine, but wait, sodium is a solid and chlorine is a gas. But sodium reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe not that.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something. Wait, sulfur is a solid, and maybe reacting with something like O2? But sulfur and O2 react to form SO2 and SO3, but I don't think that gives a red product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, another possibility. What about the formation of a compound with a high coordination number? Maybe something like iron reacting with something else. Or perhaps, wait, maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of certain compounds. For example, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Or perhaps it's a compound like CuSO4·5H2O, which is blue, but maybe another color. Alternatively, perhaps a sulfide? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: consider the reaction of a metal with a halogen. For example, when copper reacts with chlorine gas, it forms CuCl2. But that's blue, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with more equivalents, like perhaps a different stoichiometry. Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, let's think about the product C. It then reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio to form product E, which is extremely hazardous.

So, C + 2D → E.

And then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G.

So, C could be a salt that's a hydrated or something that hydrolyzes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal sulfide. Wait, but when a sulfide reacts with water, it typically produces H2S (which is a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. Hmm, but then the metal hydroxide would be A. But not sure yet.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction of C with D. C reacts with 2 moles of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe D is a gas like O2 or another diatomic gas.

Wait, if D is O2, then reacting C with O2 could produce something like a metal oxide. But I'm not sure if that would be extremely hazardous.
