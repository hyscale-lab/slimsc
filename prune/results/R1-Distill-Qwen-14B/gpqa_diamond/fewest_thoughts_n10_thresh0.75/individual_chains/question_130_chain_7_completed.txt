Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based optical telescopes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, but when it's absorbed by hydrogen clouds, it must be redshifted. 

So, the key here is probably about redshift and whether the wavelength after shifting falls within the optical range that ground-based telescopes can observe. Because if the redshifted wavelength is in the optical, we can detect it. But if it's shifted into the infrared or something else, maybe we can't observe it with optical telescopes.

Wait, ground-based optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the visible spectrum, right? So visible light is roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. But wait, what's the Lyman alpha wavelength? Oh, it's 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet, which is why the intergalactic medium can absorb it because the Earth's atmosphere doesn't let UV through, so it's a problem for observation from the ground.

But when the quasar's light is redshifted, the Lyman alpha absorption line moves to a longer wavelength. So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that this line is detectable in optical. So, the redshifted wavelength should be within the optical range.

So the formula for redshift is (1 + z) = observed wavelength / rest wavelength.

The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers. We want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range, say, less than about 700 nm or 0.7 micrometers? Or wait, wait, some ground telescopes can go a bit beyond, but generally, optical is up to around 1 micrometer or so? Hmm, maybe I should check that. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is when the wavelength just enters the optical, like maybe around 400 nm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about an estimate of the lower limit. So the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So the observed wavelength has to be greater than the cutoff where it's still observable. Let's say the optical range is up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm). But wait, 1000 nm is 1 micrometer. But some optical telescopes can go a bit into near-infrared, but the question is about optical. So perhaps the maximum wavelength is around 800 nm or so?

Wait, let me think. The visible spectrum is about 400-700 nm. But some ground-based telescopes can go into the near-infrared, which is up to about 2500 nm. But the question is about optical, so probably up to about 1000 nm. Alternatively, maybe the cutoff is when the wavelength is just entering the range where it's detectable with optical telescopes, perhaps around 400 nm? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the original wavelength is 121 nm, so to get to 400 nm, the redshift would be (400/121) ≈3.3, so z≈2.3.

Wait, that approach might be the way. Let me formalize this.

The observed wavelength λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest.

We want λ_obs to be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Let's pick 700 nm as the upper limit for optical (since some might say visible is up to 700 nm). Wait, but I think ground-based optical telescopes can actually observe up to around 1 or even 2 micrometers, but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact limit. But for this problem, perhaps assuming that the cutoff is 700 nm.

So, set λ_obs = 700 nm. Then,

(1 + z) = 700 nm / 121.6 nm.

Wait, but wait. The units need to be consistent. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So 700 nm is 700 nm.

So (1 + z) = 700 / 121.6 ≈5.756.

So z ≈4.756.

Wait, but that's a high redshift. The options given are up to 2.4, so this can't be right. Hmm. Did I mess up the units somewhere?

Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. Because higher redshift means longer wavelengths. So if the Lyman alpha is observed in the optical, which is longer than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, no, because redshift moves the wavelength to longer wavelengths. So if the rest is 1216 A, to get into optical (which is much longer wavelengths), the redshift must be significant.

Wait, but when the question says "estimate the lower limit on the redshift", that implies the minimum redshift needed for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical. So the line must be redshifted into the optical range. So, the minimum z would be when the Lyman alpha is at the lower end of the optical.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the Lyman alpha line moving into the optical's minimum wavelength. No, that can't be right because if it's at the lower end of optical, the observed wavelength would be just above the cutoff where it's detectable.

Wait, optical light starts at about 400 nm, so the lower end. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted to 400 nm, then:

(1 + z) = 400 nm / 121.6 nm ≈3.29.

So z ≈2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close, and option D is 1.9.

Wait, but perhaps the question is the opposite. Maybe it's about the Lyman alpha line being absorbed in the optical, so the quasar's light is redshifted such that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical.

Wait, but the question says the clouds absorb the light at Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasars' light is being absorbed by the hydrogen clouds, which are at some redshift. So the observed absorption line in the quasar's spectrum would be at (1 + z) * 1216 A.

We need this to be in the optical range. So for a ground-based telescope to detect the absorption line, it must be in the optical.

Wait, but ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm because the atmosphere absorbs that. So the Lyman alpha line, which is at 1216 A (121.6 nm) in the quasar's frame, would be redshifted to longer wavelengths.

So, to have the absorption line in the optical, the observed wavelength should be above about 300 nm (since that's the start of the atmospheric transmission in the UV). Wait, no, the atmosphere is opaque to most UV, but there are windows. The lowest F layer of the atmosphere allows some UV through, but most ground-based telescopes can observe up to around 300 nm or so. Wait, but I think ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 310 nm because of the ozone absorption. So for a ground-based telescope, the observed wavelength has to be longer than about 300 nm.

So the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted to 300 nm, would be the lower limit for detection.

So:

(1 + z) = 300 nm / 121.6 nm ≈2.467.

So z ≈1.467.

Looking at the options, the closest lower limit would be z=1.9 or 2.4. Hmm, wait, 1.467 is approximately 1.47. But the options don't have that. So the lower limit would be when the Lyman alpha is just at the edge of observable. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is around 300 nm.

So (1 + z) = 300 / 121.6 ≈2.467, so z≈1.467. So the minimal redshift is about 1.47. If the redshift is higher, it's further into the optical.

But looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 1.47 would be between B (1.2) and D (1.9). So the lower limit would be around 1.47. So any redshift higher than this would place the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So the lower limit is z ≈1.47.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption on the maximum observable wavelength.

Wait, maybe the optical range extends up to 1000 nm (1 micrometer). So at that point,

(1 + z) = 1000 / 121.6 ≈8.225, so z≈7.225.

But that's way higher than any of the options. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha forest, which is observed in quasar spectra. So when the quasar's light passes through clouds with redshift z, the Lyman alpha absorption is seen at (1 + z) * 1216 A.

But for ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be longer than about 400 nm (visible light starts at about 400 nm). So if the absorption line is in the visible, the quasar must have a redshift such that (1 + z) * 121.6 A <= 400 nm.

Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So:

(1 + z) * 1216 A ≤ 4000 A.

So 1 + z ≤4000 / 1216 ≈3.29.

So z ≤2.29.

Wait, but that's the maximum redshift for the absorption line to be at 400 nm. So if the cloud has a higher redshift than that, the Lyman alpha line would be at longer than 4000 A, which would be in the infrared and not detected by optical telescopes. Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, if the cloud's redshift is higher than z=2.29, then the observed wavelength would be longer than 400 nm. So for example, if the cloud is at z=3, the observed wavelength is (1+3)*1216=4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm, which is blue. That's in the optical.

Wait, so perhaps I was confused earlier.

Wait, let's clarify:

The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) in the rest frame. If a cloud at redshift z absorbs this line, the observed wavelength is (1 + z) * 1216 A.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption line can be detected with optical telescopes. So, the absorption line must be in the optical range.

Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So, for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, (1+z)*1216 must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

But wait, 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 A → 1+z >= 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z >=2.29.

Similarly, 1+z <=7000/1216≈5.756 → z<=4.756.

So the Lyman alpha line will be in the optical if z is between about 2.29 and 4.756.

But the question is about the lower limit for detection. So the minimum z is approximately 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would have the Lyman alpha in the optical.

But the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is close to option C) 2.4. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the maximum wavelength of optical. Suppose optical is considered up to 1000 nm (1 micrometer), which is 10000 Angstroms. Then,

(1 + z) = 10000 / 1216 ≈8.225 → z=7.225. But that's way higher than any option, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is at the maximum wavelength that can be observed by ground-based optical telescopes. So the cutoff is at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So, (1+z)*1216 =4000 → z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the lower limit for the redshift is 2.29. So the object must have a redshift of at least 2.29 to have the Lyman alpha in the optical.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4.

But another thought: maybe the question is about the Lyman alpha line being in the rest frame, and the quasar's light is redshifted. Wait, no, the absorption is in the quasar's light, so the absorption line is at (1+z) * 1216 A.

So for the line to be in the optical, (1+z) must be such that the wavelength is ≤700 nm (7000 A) and ≥400 nm (4000 A).

So the minimum z is when (1+z)*1216=4000 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, which is just under option C (2.4). But 2.29 is about 2.3, which is close to 2.4. So the lower limit is around 2.3, and the next higher option is 2.4. So 2.4 is the minimal redshift in the options that would place the line in the optical.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the quasar's light is not redshifted enough, so that the absorption line is in the UV, which we can't observe. So the minimal redshift is when the Lyman alpha line is just at the start of the optical, which is 400 nm. So the same calculation applies.

So, the minimal z is about 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the options given don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is the next higher option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Calculating 4000 / 1216:

1216 * 3 = 3648.

4000 - 3648 = 352.

352 /1216 = 0.289.

So 3.289. So 1 + z =3.289 → z=2.289.

So about 2.29.

So closest option is C)2.4.

Wait, but option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So if the redshift is 1.9, then the observed wavelength is (1.9 +1)*1216 = 2.9 *1216 ≈3526.4 A, which is 352.6 nm, into the UV. So in that case, ground-based telescopes wouldn't detect it because the atmosphere blocks that wavelength.

So the minimal redshift is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the lower limit is z≈2.3. So the minimal redshift is just above 2.3. So the objects must have a redshift greater than 2.3 to be detected.

Looking at the options, the only option higher than 2.3 is option C)2.4. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So if the redshift is 2.4, the Lyman alpha line is observed at (2.4 +1)*1216 =3.4 *1216 =4134.4 A, which is 413.4 nm, which is violet, but within the visible range.

So the lower limit is when (1 + z) * 1216 = 4000 A, which gives z= (4000/1216) –1 = 3.289 –1= 2.289.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Since the options don't have 2.29, the next possible is 2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman-alpha line being observed in the near-infrared, but the question specifies optical.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the confusion is between the rest wavelength and the observed. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light, which passes through hydrogen clouds at redshift z. The clouds absorb at Lyman alpha, which is 1216 A in the cloud's rest frame. The observed wavelength is (1 + z) *1216 A.

We need this observed wavelength to be in the optical, which is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 A).

So to have the observed wavelength within optical, (1 + z) must be between 4000/1216 ≈3.29 and 7000/1216≈5.756.

So the minimal z is 3.29–1=2.29.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the options are C)2.4. So option C is the minimal redshift where the Lyman alpha line is in the optical.

So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that the Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between redshift and the observed wavelength. The Lyman alpha line is redshifted according to the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \cdot \lambda_{\text{rest}}
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) must fall within the optical range, which is approximately \(400 \, \text{nm} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 700 \, \text{nm}\).

### Step 1: Calculate the minimum redshift
For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical, the observed wavelength must be at least \(400 \, \text{nm}\). Using the formula:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm}\) and \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{400}{121.6} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to enter the optical range is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\).

### Step 2: Compare with the options
The options provided are:
- **A) 3**
- **B) 1.2**
- **C) 2.4**
- **D) 1.9**

The calculated minimum redshift is \(z \approx 2.29\), which is closest to option **C) 2.4**. At this redshift, the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \cdot \lambda_{\text{rest}} = (1 + 2.4) \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} = 3.4 \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} \approx 413.4 \, \text{Å} = 413.4 \, \text{nm}
\]

This wavelength is within the optical range and detectable by ground-based telescopes.

### Step 3: Analyze other options
- **A) 3**: At \(z = 3\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + 3) \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} = 4 \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} = 486.4 \, \text{Å} = 486.4 \, \text{nm}
\]

This is also within the optical range, but it is higher than the minimum redshift.

- **B) 1.2**: At \(z = 1.2\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + 1.2) \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} = 2.2 \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} \approx 267.5 \, \text{Å} = 267.5 \, \text{nm}
\]

This is in the ultraviolet (UV) range and cannot be detected by optical ground-based telescopes.

- **D) 1.9**: At \(z = 1.9\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + 1.9) \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} = 2.9 \cdot 121.6 \, \text{Å} \approx 352.6 \, \text{Å} = 352.6 \, \text{nm}
\]

This is also in the UV range and cannot be detected by optical ground-based telescopes.

### Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the closest value is **C) 2.4**.
