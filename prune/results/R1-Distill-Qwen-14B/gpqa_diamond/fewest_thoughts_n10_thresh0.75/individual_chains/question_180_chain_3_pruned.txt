Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, expressed in Joules and correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with charges and potential energy, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is (k * q1 * q2) / r. But wait, since there are multiple charges, I think I need to consider all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since the 13th charge is fixed at point P and the others are all at 2 meters away, each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from the 13th.

So, let me break this down. The system has 13 charges. 12 are fixed at 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others form a sort of sphere around it, each at radius 2 m.

Each of the 12 charges will have an interaction with the central charge. Also, each of the 12 charges will interact with each other. Since all the 12 are identical and at the same distance from each other, I need to calculate both the central charge interactions and the interactions between the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. Does that mean they are all at the same point 2 m away from P, or are they arranged in a sphere such that each is 2 m from P? I think it's the latter because if they were all at the same point, that would cause a lot of issues with overlapping charges, but the problem probably assumes they are each at 2 m from P but arranged symmetrically, maybe in a sphere or something. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their arrangement. Hmmm, but wait, if all 12 are constrained to remain exactly 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual distances vary, but I don't have enough information about their positions relative to each other. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well? No, that can't be right because 12 charges can't all be equally spaced at the same distance if they're all at 2 m from P. So perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being 2 m from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. However, when calculating the potential energy, perhaps the mutual interactions between the 12 charges would require knowing the distances between each pair, which depends on their arrangement. Oh, this is getting complicated.
