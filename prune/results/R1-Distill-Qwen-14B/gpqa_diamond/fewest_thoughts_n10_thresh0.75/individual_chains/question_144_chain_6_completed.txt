Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

Alright, the question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma, times the velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length L is approximately gamma * v * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. 

Wait, but tau is the mean lifetime, which is related to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle says that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. Specifically, tau = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but Γ is given in MeV, so I probably need to convert units properly.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity of the particle. Since it's a resonance, probably moving relativistically. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is higher than the rest mass, which makes sense for a resonance.
3. The energy E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but E here is given in GeV, m is in GeV/c². So perhaps we can compute gamma as E/(m c²) but considering the units.

Wait, let me think in natural units for a moment. In particle physics, often c=1 and ħ=1, so units are a bit different. But when dealing with real-world units like meters and seconds, I have to be careful.

First, calculate the width Γ in GeV: Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Then, tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me get the value: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, so in GeV and seconds, ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / (0.32) ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 GeV·s divided by GeV would give seconds. Wait, no, tau is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → the GeV cancels, so tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find the velocity. The particle's energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². The gamma factor is E/(m c²) → but wait, since in natural units, E (GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c². So gamma would be E/(m). Wait, because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But if E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², respectively, perhaps the units can be adjusted.

Wait, let's express c in terms that make the calculation easier. Let me think. In natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) is equal to gamma * m (GeV/c²) times c squared. Wait, no, actually E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c² → so E (GeV) = gamma m GeV. So gamma is E/(m). So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) ) → 1/( (20/3)^2 ) is (9/400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887 → v ≈ 0.9887c.

Alternatively, perhaps using precise calculations: gamma is 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈ 6.66666667. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) ) → 1/( (400/9) ) ) = 9/400 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime we have is tau ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. The mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up; the mean lifetime is tau proper, so the moving lifetime is gamma tau. But wait, the mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ. So when the particle is moving, the lifetime from our frame is gamma tau. So the decay length L = v * gamma tau. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, let me clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. So from our frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma: tau_lab = gamma tau. So the decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v gamma tau.

So putting it all together: L = beta c gamma tau.

But tau is (ħ)/(Γ), so substituting:

L = beta c gamma ( ħ / Γ )

But let me plug in the numbers step by step.

Compute beta * c * gamma * tau.

Beta is ~0.9887, c is ~3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So:

beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 2.966e8 * 6.6667 ≈ 1.977e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.977e9 m/s * 2.056e-24 s → 1.977e9 * 2.056e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056) * 1e-15.

Multiply 1.977 by 2.056: approximately 4.065. So 4.065e-15 meters.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation:

1.977e9 * 2.056e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056) * 1e9 * 1e-24 = (approx 4.065) * 1e-15 → 4.065e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but wait another thing: let me recheck the calculation of beta. Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma)^2 )) → gamma squared is (400/9), so 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.

Yes. So beta is ≈0.9887.

Then, beta * c is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So beta*c*gamma is 2.966e8 * 6.6667 ≈ 1.977e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau of 2.056e-24 s:

1.977e9 * 2.056e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056) * 1e-15.

Calculating 1.977 *2.056:

Let me compute that accurately.

1.977 * 2 = 3.954.

1.977 * 0.056 = approx 0.1107.

So total is around 4.0647.

So 4.0647e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.065e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's the correct one.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15. Did I make a mistake in any of the steps?

Wait another thing: Oh wait, perhaps I should have considered the total energy correctly. The total energy E is given as 8 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²). But in natural units, m is in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but with the units involved, maybe I should have considered that correctly.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me re-examine this.

In natural units where ħ = c = 1, energy E (GeV) and mass m (GeV/c²) can be tricky. Let me use units more carefully.

The relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Then, gamma is E/(m c²) → wait, no, gamma is (E)/(m c²). Because when E = m c² (rest energy), gamma is 1.

So gamma = E/(m c²). But in our case, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c², so:

gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) → units: GeV / (GeV) → unitless, which is correct.

So, E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 /1.2 = 6.6667. That's correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have used the velocity from beta = p c / E. Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c².

So beta = v/c = p c / E. Let me compute that.

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c^2)^2 ) → sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2 ) GeV → sqrt(64 -1.44 ) ≈ sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ≈ 0.9887. Which matches the previous calculation. So yes, beta is correct.

So, no mistake in that.

Then, calculating L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, another point: tau is the mean lifetime. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct.

So, all the steps seem correct.

So the mean decay length is approximately 4.065e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Wait, option C is 5.0223e-15. Did I miss something? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that when calculating the velocity, I should have used relativistic equations differently. Let me recheck.

Wait, the decay length formula is L = (gamma v c tau) * (c tau), but perhaps I missed a factor. Another approach: The mean proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The distance is velocity multiplied by this lifetime: L = v gamma tau.

But v is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Which is what I did. So no mistake.

Wait, but let me compute the numbers again with more precise values:

Calculating beta: Let me compute gamma exactly as 20/3.

Gamma = 20/3 → gamma squared is 400/9.

1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Square root is √0.9775. Let me compute that precisely.

0.9775^0.5: Let me think. 0.9887^2 is 0.9775, because 0.9887 *0.9887 = approximately 0.9775, yes.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

So beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.66666667.

Gamma multiplied by beta c: 6.66666667 * 2.9661e8 = let's compute.

6.66666667 * 2.9661e8 = (20/3)*2.9661e8 = (20 * 2.9661e8 ) /3.

20 *2.9661e8 =5.9322e9.

Divided by 3: 1.9774e9 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau of 2.056e-24 s:

1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (1.9774 *2.056 ) * 1e-15.

1.9774 * 2.056 → Let me compute this precisely.

1.9774 * 2 =3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056: Let's calculate 1.9774 *0.05 =0.09887, 1.9774 *0.006=0.0118644. So total 0.1107344.

So 3.9548 + 0.1107344 =4.0655344.

So 4.0655e-15 meters.

Which matches option B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, compute \( \beta \gamma c \):

\[
\beta \gamma c = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 1.977 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( \tau \):

\[
L = 1.977 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24} = (1.977 \cdot 2.056) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 1.977 \cdot 2.056 \):

\[
1.977 \cdot 2.056 \approx 4.0655.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
