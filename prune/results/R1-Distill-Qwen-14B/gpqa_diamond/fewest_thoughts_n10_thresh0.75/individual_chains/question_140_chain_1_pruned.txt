Okay, I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's just above freezing point of water, so maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature.

Then there's a mention of a keto acid reacting with substance X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope. X's analog is close, so perhaps it's a common reagent.

Let me think about possible reactions. The violent reaction with a liquid... Could Y be water? If so, then the reaction of X with water releasing gas W. What gases are formed when metals react with water? Hydrogen is a possibility. Wait, but the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons as H1, but maybe deuterium? No, deuterium has one proton and one neutron, so the molecule would be D2. But wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons would be equal. So each molecule of W has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but hydrogen gas is H2, which has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons in H2 is 2, neutrons 0. But that's not equal. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, if the gas is carbon monoxide, CO. But CO has 6 protons (C) and 8 neutrons (O has 8, but wait, no. CO molecule would have 6 protons (from C) and 8 from O, but total for the molecule would be 6+8=14 for protons and 8 for neutrons? No, wait. Or maybe another approach: the total protons and neutrons in the molecule must be equal.

Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules.

For example, if W is carbon monoxide (
