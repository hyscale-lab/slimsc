Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a chemical reaction, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

First, the question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Then it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of n and p means the molecule is probably something like O2 or another diatomic gas, but wait, O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each, so each molecule would have 16 p and 16 n. Wait, no, O2 has two atoms, each with 8 p and 8 n. So total p is 16, n is 16. So the molecule would have equal number of p and n. That fits. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, wait, CO2 has a different structure.

Wait, but the question says the gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Let's think: a molecule where each atom has the same number of n and p. For example, O has 8 p and 8 n, so O2 would have 16 p and 16 n. So that would fit. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, because C has 6 p and 6 n, H has 1 each. CH4 would have (6+1*4) p and same n, but that would be 10 p and (6 +4*1) n? Wait, no, each H has 1 n. Wait, CH4 has one C (6p, 6n) and four H (each 1p, 1n). So total p = 6 +4*1=10; total n =6 +4*1=10. So that's another possibility. So the gas could be CH4, but more likely O2 or another diatomic gas.

Then, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0 C, so 277 is 4 C. Hmm, what's a substance that melts around there? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Maybe something else. Wait, maybe B is water? But wait, water is H2O. But wait, if G is a precipitate that when heated releases B, which is maybe H2O? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is some metal, but I'm not sure.

Moving on, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product has two oxygen atoms. What reactions involve keto acids reacting with something to form a product with two oxygen atoms?

Wait, maybe the substance X is a strong base, like NaOH or KOH. Because when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacts with a base, it forms a salt and water. But the product here would be the salt, which might have a certain number of oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe X is something like ammonia, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question also says that the substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of something like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) or maybe something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but probably more likely a strong acid or base. Wait, but if X is a base, when it reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it would form a carboxylate salt. Let's think about that.

For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the reaction would produce sodium acetate and water. The product, sodium acetate, has a formula of CH3COONa, which has two oxygen atoms per formula unit. Wait, no: CH3COO^- Na^+ has two O in the acetate ion. So the product has two oxygens.
