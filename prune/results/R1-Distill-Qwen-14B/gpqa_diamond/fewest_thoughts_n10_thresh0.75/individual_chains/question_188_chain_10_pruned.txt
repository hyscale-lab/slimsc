Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles the same, which I think makes them a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when all angles are 90 degrees, but when the angles are different (like 60 or 30 degrees), it's a different system. Oh right, rhombohedral can be in the cubic system with all a=b=c but angles not 90, so yeah, that's right.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, but wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 Å. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are the same length (a), and all angles are equal. So that's correct.

The question asks for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) / (1 + cos α cos β cos γ - cos α cos β - cos β cos γ - cos γ cos α) )) )? Wait, that sounds complicated. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think for cubic systems, the formula simplifies, but here it's a rhombohedral, which is a special case.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula involves the angles between the lattice vectors. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor (also called the
