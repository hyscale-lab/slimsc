Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. They’re asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal. So it's like a cube that's been skewed, but all edges are the same length. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Ang, that's the lattice parameter 'a', right?

The interplanar distance is calculated using the formula for d-spacing. I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, this is a rhombohedral system. So I think the formula is similar but includes the angles.

Right, for a rhombohedral system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )^(1/2) )? Or maybe another form. Alternatively, I think it's d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos gamma) )? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factor.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector (h a + k b + l c), but wait, in the rhombohedral case, since a = b = c, and all the angles are equal, the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, no, that can’t be right because if the angles are 90 degrees (like in a cubic system), then cos 90 is zero, and we get d = a / sqrt(h²
