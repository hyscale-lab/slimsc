Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, right? And they're talking about Lorentz factors. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Oh yeah, right, and at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to the speed of light c, so gamma is large.

The problem says that when particles are collided in a spherical detector, about one third of the fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the inner walls.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the original setup has a Lorentz factor of ~20, and one third reach the walls. Now, they want two-thirds to reach, so what gamma is needed?

I think I need to find how the gamma relates to the fraction of particles reaching the detector. Oh, wait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particles to decay versus the time it takes for them to reach the wall.

Right, because if a particle decays before it reaches the wall, it won't be detected. So the fraction depends on whether the particle's lifetime is long enough for it to travel the radius of the detector.

Wait, but particles are moving at speed v, so the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R / v. And the particle's lifetime, from our frame, is gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame).

So, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is that gamma * tau >= t = R/(v). Because if the lifetime is longer than the travel time, the particle will make it.

So, the fraction f of particles that reach the wall can be found by the probability that their lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. Assuming that the decay is exponential, the probability that a particle survives (doesn't decay) until time t is e^(-t/tau). But wait, no, tau is the mean lifetime, so the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma * tau)). Wait, no, wait. Because from our frame,
