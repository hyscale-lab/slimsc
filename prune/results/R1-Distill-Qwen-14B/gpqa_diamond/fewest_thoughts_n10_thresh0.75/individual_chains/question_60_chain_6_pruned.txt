Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that an astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. They're traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So, they're probably concerned about whether they'll live long enough to make the trip.

Wait, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So we're looking at their proper time, right? Because in special relativity, time experienced by the traveler is the proper time, which is shorter than the time measured in the Earth's frame.

First, I think I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the LMC is about 160,000 to 180,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me go with an average, say 170,000 light-years. So the distance D is roughly 1.7e5 light-years.

The speed is given as 0.99999987c. So the speed v is very close to c. That means the time experienced by the astronaut would be much less than what someone on Earth would see.

Wait, but wait. From the astronaut's perspective, they're moving at v, and Earth is moving towards them at v. So the time they experience is D divided by their speed, but adjusted for time dilation. Or is it better to use the time dilation formula?

Oh right, the proper time τ is given by the equation τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame. Or wait, no, the other way around. The astronaut's time is shorter, so τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or is it t = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)?

Wait, I think the correct formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if we can find t from Earth's perspective, then multiply by that factor to get τ, the astronaut's time.

But first, what's t from Earth's perspective? The time t would be the distance divided by speed, right? So t = D
