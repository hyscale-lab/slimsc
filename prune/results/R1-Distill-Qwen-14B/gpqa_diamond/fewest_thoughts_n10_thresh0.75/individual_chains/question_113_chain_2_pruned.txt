Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Let me go through each of the given data points step by step and see what they tell me.

First, let's look at the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption at around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of either an -OH group (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an amine (but since there's no mention of NMR peaks for amines, I'll focus on the OH possibility). The other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ are important. The 1700 peak is typically a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might indicate another type of carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide. Wait, but if the compound has both 1700 and 1650, maybe it's something like an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's two different carbonyl groups, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring stretching, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is another group, like an amide or maybe a conjugated double bond. But let me think again—carbonyl groups in esters are usually around 1700-1750, and if there's another peak lower, perhaps a conjugated double bond, like in a vinyl group.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. That suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps part of an ester or another group that includes a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens tells me there's at least one double bond in the structure.

Now the Mass Spectrometry
