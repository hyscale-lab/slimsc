Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which I remember is usually indicative of O-H stretching. That makes me think maybe the compound has an alcohol group or maybe a ketone or something else with an O-H.

Wait, but wait. A broad peak is more typical of O-H in something like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2800, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or a phenol. Or perhaps it's an amide or something else with an O-H group.

Looking at the other peaks in the FTIR: there are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=C in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an amide or something else.

Wait, 1700 is typical for esters, ketones, aldehydes. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with C=C. Hmm. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and another group.

Looking at the 1H NMR: it says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments correspond to m/z 45. Common fragments at 45 include the methyl group attached to an oxygen, like in ethers or esters. Or perhaps a ketone or something else. Alternatively, could it be a CH3O group? Wait, CH3O has a molecular weight of 31 (
