Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Wait, no, let's see the numbering: positions 1, 2, and 3. Oh, wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be such that the substituents are in specific positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the structure: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, position 3 has nitro. So it's a meta arrangement? Or maybe each substituent is in adjacent positions?

Wait, no, actually, in benzene, the numbering is such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in adjacent positions? Like 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a row.

But regardless, the substituents are in positions 1,2,3, which may be adjacent. So the benzene ring has three substituents in a row.

Now, the question is about the reaction sequence. So, how do I go from benzene to this tri-substituted benzene?

I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene, substituents can direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions. For example, activating groups (like -OEt, which is an ethoxy group) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the order of reactions. Since each substituent is added step by step, the order in which they are added will determine the positions they end up in.

So perhaps the first substituent added should be a group that directs the next substituent
