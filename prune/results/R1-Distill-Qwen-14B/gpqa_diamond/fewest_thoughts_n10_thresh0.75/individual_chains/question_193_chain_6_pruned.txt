Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what it's about. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Wait, no, the formula is distance d in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax plx. So d = 1/plx.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So it's about the density of stars as a function of distance.

So the given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we have N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 

1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, I think that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So that's the differential, like the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr.

Wait, wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number density. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region of the sky would depend on the volume, but the way the question is phrased, it's varying with parallax. So perhaps the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is the same as d^5. But wait, that doesn't seem right because as distance increases, the number of stars in a region would generally decrease because stars are spread out more, but maybe not in this specific scenario.

Wait, no, let's not get confused. The problem says that in that specific region, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

But wait, I'm supposed to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's about the differential number of stars with distance. Let me think about that.

If N is the number of stars in a region, and that's proportional to d^5, then what is the number per unit distance? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume of that shell multiplied by the density at that distance.

Wait, but wait, the density here is not the same as the usual volume density. Oh, because the number of stars scales as d^5. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the number density (stars per unit volume) multiplied by the volume of the shell. 

Wait, but in this case, the number of stars per unit area on the sky is probably varying as 1/plx^5. Because parallax gives you distance, and the number of stars in a small area (like a unit area) would depend on the distance. So
