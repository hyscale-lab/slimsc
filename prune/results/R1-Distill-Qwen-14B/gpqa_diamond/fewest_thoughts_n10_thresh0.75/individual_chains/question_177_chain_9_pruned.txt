Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I remember that for stars, luminosity isn't directly proportional to mass in a linear way, but maybe for main-sequence stars, there's a mass-luminosity relation. Let me think, the relation is something like L ∝ M^3 or M^3.5 or something like that. But wait, the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies. Oh, right, so maybe I should approach this using the black body radiation formula.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. I think this is connected to Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the wavelength where a black body emits most strongly is inversely proportional to its temperature. So λ_max * T = constant. Since their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. Wait, that can't be right because the stars have different radii and masses, but maybe their temperatures are the same because the peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, no, because the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. That would imply that their effective temperatures are the same because Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is same, T is same.

So both stars have the same effective temperature.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh wait, yeah, that's the formula. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since T is the same for both stars, let me compute the ratio of their luminosities.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So
