Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. I think the question is about a dipole transition, which I'm pretty sure involves the electric dipole approximation.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which I know means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. The problem says it's a two-step dipole transition. So the electron has to drop from n=3 to some intermediate state, and then from there to n=1.

Wait, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. And for the principal quantum number n, the transition can occur between any two states as long as the other selection rules are satisfied, but usually, it's either a single step or maybe multiple steps.

So from n=3, l=0, m=0, the possible transitions are to states where l changes by ±1. Since the initial l is 0, the possible l for the intermediate state can be l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. That means the possible m values for the intermediate state are m = -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to some |2,1,m⟩ state, and then to |1,0,0⟩. So the first step is from n=3 to n=2, because the second step goes from n=2 to n=1. So the first transition is 3→2, and the second is 2→1.

So during the first transition, the state must go from l=0 (3,0,0) to l=1 (2,1,m). Then, in the second transition, from l=1 (2,1,m) to l=0 (1,0,0). Since l changes by ±1 each time, that fits the selection rules.

Now, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0. Probability 1/3.
