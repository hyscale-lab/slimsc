Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through what I know.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravity causing the star to wobble.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude of the star (K) to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. The formula I remember is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( (1) / ( (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) ) ) ) 

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_planet << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is K = (v) where v depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the formula for K is K = ( (2 pi G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), assuming i is 90 degrees (edge-on, so sin i =1). But wait, maybe I should think about the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

Alternatively, the RV method gives K = (v) = ( (M_p / M_star) )^(1/3) * ( (G * P) / (2 pi c) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the relationship between K and the orbital period P. Since the same method is used for both planets and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of K for planet 2 to K for planet 1 should relate to the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Let me get the formula right.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G ) / (c^3 ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, maybe another approach. For
