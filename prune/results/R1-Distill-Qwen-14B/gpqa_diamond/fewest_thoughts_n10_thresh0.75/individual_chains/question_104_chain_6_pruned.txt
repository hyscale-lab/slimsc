Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that movement through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are roughly the same mass. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably makes the math a bit simpler.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so the key here is the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV method measures this velocity, and the shift in the spectral lines gives us that velocity.

I think the formula involved here is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). The formula is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^0.5 ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e^2)^0.5 )) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass as the Sun (M_* same for both), and assuming the inclination i is the same (like sin i is 1 for both, which is a safe assumption since they detected the planets), then K would be proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * π * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 day) ) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for the same star mass, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital period. Wait, no, because the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a³. Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so P² ≈
