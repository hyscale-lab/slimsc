Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure out each step. 

Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that triplet and quartet splitting can give clues about neighboring protons and the structure. Let's think about common structures that fit this NMR data.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm probably comes from a CH2CH3 group, maybe like an ethyl group. Because a triplet for 6H suggests two equivalent groups each with three protons, but wait, 6H would be two sets of three, like maybe two ethyl groups. Alternatively, for a triplet, each proton is split by two neighboring protons. Wait, no, a triplet would come from coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe each set of three protons is split by a neighboring group with two protons. 

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is split into four, so maybe coupling with two protons on each side. Let's think about a group like CH2CH2, but wait, that's not right. Oh wait, perhaps a -CH2CH2- group where each CH2 is next to another CH2. So for example, a -CH2CH2- group, but how does that fit with the triplet?

Wait, another approach: The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's two groups of 3H each, each as a triplet. Maybe two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Because each methyl (3H) would be next to a CH2, which has 2H. So the methyl would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2 (which has two H). So that would make sense. So the structure would have two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. So something like CH(CH2CH3)2 maybe? Or wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like two ethyl groups. Wait, that would be for 6H.

Wait, another possibility: The triplet at 0.9 ppm could be two methyl groups attached to a central CH2. So structure like (CH2CH2CH3)2CH maybe? No, that seems like more than 6H. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyc
