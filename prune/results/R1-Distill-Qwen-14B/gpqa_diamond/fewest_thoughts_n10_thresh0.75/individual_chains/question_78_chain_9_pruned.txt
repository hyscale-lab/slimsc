Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, which are described by the scalar and vector potentials respectively. Let me think about what I learned.

The question describes a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r. So, d is the displacement vector between those two points, I guess.

Wait, the problem is about finding V and A at time t. I remember that the scalar potential and vector potential for a moving charge involve some terms related to velocity. Oh right, the Liénard potentials maybe? Or maybe just the standard expressions for potentials due to a charge in motion.

In the static case, the scalar potential V is q/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh wait, for potentials, I think the scalar potential might still have a similar form, but the vector potential would involve the velocity of the charge. Or maybe not, because the vector potential is always present even when the charge isn't moving, but when it moves, it contributes more.

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is something like (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - d·v)] * (1/(something)). Or maybe it's (1/(r - (v t)/c²)) or something with velocity. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, the Lorentz transformation for potentials involves how the potentials change under different frames. Oh, but in the Coulomb gauge, the scalar potential is determined by the charge density, and the vector potential by the current. But for a moving point charge, perhaps the potentials can be found using the retarded time. Right, retarded time is tr, the time when the field was generated. So, the potentials depend on the state of the charge at that earlier time.

So, the scalar potential V(r, t) would involve the charge divided by the distance, but adjusted for the movement. Oh wait, I think the expression for V includes
