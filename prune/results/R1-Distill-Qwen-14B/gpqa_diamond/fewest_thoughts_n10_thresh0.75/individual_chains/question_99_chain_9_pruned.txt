Okay, I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, and I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The IR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. From what I remember, the broad peak around 3000 is usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. And the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl group (C=O). So, this suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Because carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O groups.

Wait, but wait. Could it be something else? Like an ester or ketone? The broad peak at 3000 is more characteristic of an O-H in a carboxylic acid rather than an alcohol. Because alcohols usually have a less broad peak, maybe around 3300. But carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding. So I think it's a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, ruling out any alkenes. So all the structures must have no vinyl groups, which they probably don't since they're all substituted with various alkyl groups.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns.

Each splitting (like doublet, triplet, etc.) arises from coupling with neighboring protons. The more neighboring groups with protons, the more complex the splitting. So a doublet of triplets of quartets... wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse that. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, no, maybe it's a quartet of triplets of doublets? No, the way it's written, it's a doublet (so two peaks), each of which is a triplet, and each of those is a quartet. So the splitting is being caused by three different groups of protons each with different coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps it's more likely that each splitting is due to adjacent groups. So, for a signal that is a doublet of triplets, maybe each proton is next to a CH₂ group (giving a triplet) and also next to another CH group (giving a doublet). Or maybe it's a more complex arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each causing splitting. For example, if a proton is next to a CH₂ group (which would split it into a triplet) and another CH
