Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when dealing with charges, the energy is usually related to the electric potential energy between them. Since all the charges are the same sign, they would repel each other, so bringing them together would require work. But wait, in this case, 12 are fixed at a distance of 2m from point P, which has the 13th charge. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed one, and then maybe consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, but wait. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, all charges are either at P or at 2m away. But 12 are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are all at 2 meters from the 13th. But do I need to consider the energy between the 12 charges among themselves as well?

Wait, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some symmetrical way? Like, maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something? Or are they all at the same point? But the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But their positions relative to each other could vary, but they must all be on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m around P.

Wait, but for the minimum energy, the system would arrange itself such that the potential energy is minimized. Since all the charges are positive (each is 2e), the charges would repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible, right? But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at
