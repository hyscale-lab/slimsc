Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Alright, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when a measurement is made. The eigenvalue gives the result of the measurement.

So the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So,

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, the problem is about the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which would have components (nx, 0, nz), with nx^2 + nz^2 = 1.

Since the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, I think the operator P is given in the direction of n. So I need to find the operator P along n, which would be the vector sum of P_x, P_y, and P_z, each multiplied by the corresponding component of n. But wait, no, because n lies in x-z, the y-component is zero. So the operator along direction n would be P·n̂, which is nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The operator for the component along a direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator we're looking at is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that
