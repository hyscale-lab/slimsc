Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, let's see. The operator P is a vector operator, so it should have components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

The matrices are:
- P_x: [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.
- P_y: [[0, -i],[i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.
- P_z: [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P is along a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, which means it's in the plane where y=0. So, the direction vector n could be written as (a, 0, b), where a and b are real numbers and a² + b² = 1. 

Since the operator P is along n, the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is P_x a + P_z b. Or more accurately, the operator is P · n = a P_x + b P_z - wait, because n is a unit vector, so n = (a, 0, b), and P is a vector operator, so P·n would be a P_x + 0 * P_y + b P_z.

Wait, but for the problem, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the normalized eigenvector will depend on the angles defining the direction. But I'm not sure how that plays into the eigenvectors. Maybe I should start by finding the general form of the eigenvectors for the operator P·n.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, substituting, (a P_x + b P_z)|ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me express each component as matrices. Let's compute a P_x + b P_z.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so a P_x is (a ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so b P_z is (b ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Adding them together:

a P_x + b P_z = ( ħ/2 ) * [ [ b, a ], [a, -b ] ]

Because the (1,1) element is b* (ħ/2), (1,2) is a*(ħ/2), (2,1) is a*(ħ/2), and (2,2) is -b*(ħ/2).

Wait, no: Let me write it correctly. Let's compute the matrix:

Each term in a P
