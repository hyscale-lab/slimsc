Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, I should try to interpret this.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's quite a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton (CHO). Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's part of an enal structure, like a conjugated system.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for para-substituted aromatic rings. Like phenyl groups where the substituents are in the para positions. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets, each with two H's.

Then there's a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange with protons, like -OH groups, but sometimes they're from protons in an enol form or maybe some conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, it could be the protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a dienol or something similar.

The peak at 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2CH2 group? Or perhaps a methylene next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an alkoxy group.

Putting this together, the structure might involve a benzaldehyde group (since the aldehyde is present), connected to other aromatic rings or substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Perhaps the molecule has a central chain with an aldehyde group at one end. The aldehyde is a triplet, so it's coupled with two adjacent Hs. That suggests that the aldehyde is part of an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde), like R-CH2-CHO, but conjugated with a double bond. Wait, but the coupling in the triplet would imply that the aldehyde proton is next to two protons from a CH2 group, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like R-CH=CH-CHO. Hmm, that's possible.

Wait, the aldehyde is at the end, so maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't explain the aromatic signals.
