Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula, if I recall correctly, is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, because the width is the inverse of the lifetime. But wait, mesons are bosons, so their decay is a bit different perhaps? Or maybe not, because the formula should generally apply.

But wait, the decay distance isn't just lifetime; it's the product of velocity and lifetime. So the mean decay length L would be L = v * τ. Alternatively, since τ is ħ / Γ, and v is the velocity, so L = v * ħ / Γ.

But wait, what's the velocity v here? Because the meson has a certain energy, so I can find its velocity from its energy and mass.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, which is the production energy. The meson has a rest mass of 1.2 GeV. So I can find its gamma factor, the Lorentz factor, which is γ = E/(m c²). Wait, E is the total energy, so yes.

But wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in units where c=1, so perhaps we can ignore c in the calculations. Let's see.

So E = γ m c². Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV/c², then γ = E/(m c²) but if we take c=1 in these units, then γ would be E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, wait, actually, E in GeV is the total energy, which is γ m c². But in natural units, c is 1, so E = γ m. So γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c. So solving for β: β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that.

γ is 8/(1.2) = 6.666667. So 1/γ squared is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887c. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, but maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me calculate 1/γ = 1/(8/1.2) = 1.2/8 = 0.15. So 1 - (1/γ)^2 is 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1-0.0225=0.9775. The square root is sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887, so β is 0.9887. So v = 0.9887c.

So now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. What's ħ in units that will make the calculation easy? Let's see. Since energy and mass are in GeV and MeV, perhaps I should convert everything into compatible units.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check that number. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes, that's correct.

Now,
