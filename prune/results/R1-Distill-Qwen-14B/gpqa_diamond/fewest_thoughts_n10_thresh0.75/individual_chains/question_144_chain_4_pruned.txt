Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when particles decay, the mean distance they travel before decaying is related to their lifetime and speed. But wait, how exactly do they calculate that?

Let me think. So, the formula for mean decay distance should involve the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean distance L is given by L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the particle's velocity divided by the speed of light.

First, I need to calculate the lifetime τ. I remember that the lifetime is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). Wait, but I should be careful about the exact relation. I think τ is ħ/(Γ), but I'm not 100% sure. Oh wait, no, more precisely, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that sounds right.

Now, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, but Γ has units of energy. So when I compute τ, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. I think I'll need to convert Γ from MeV to Joules because the reduced Planck constant ħ is in J·s.

Wait, but maybe I can work in natural units for some parts. Alternatively, use the formula in terms of units that can be converted properly. Let me think about the steps again.

Calculating τ: τ ≈ ħ / Γ. So first, I need to compute ħ. I know ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

But Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert 320 MeV into Joules. How do I do that? Oh, right, 1 eV is 1.602 × 10^-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, which is 1.602e-13 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV, which is 32
