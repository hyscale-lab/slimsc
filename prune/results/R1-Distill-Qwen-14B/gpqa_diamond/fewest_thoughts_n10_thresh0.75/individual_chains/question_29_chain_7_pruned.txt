Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about genetics and plant breeding. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The gene has five exons and four introns, which probably means it's a larger gene, but maybe that's not too important for the question.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a method that causes point mutations, typically by adding methyl groups to DNA bases, leading to mismatches during replication. So EMS tends to cause transitions, especially C to T or G to A changes (and their complementary changes, T to C or A to G).

Looking at the problem, they've sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences.

The question is asking which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the idea is that a mutation in the gene will disrupt its function, either by causing a premature stop codon or by altering the protein enough that it doesn't function. If the gene is responsible for making the compound, disrupting it should stop production, thus solving the problem.

Let me look at each mutant and see what changes they have compared to the wild type.

First, let's write down the wild-type sequence and the mutants:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, let's compare each position. Let me break it down letter by letter.

Looking at the first part:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant1:    ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TGC G...

Wait, let me compare each position. Let's look for differences.

Looking at the first part:

Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare the sequences:

Starting from the beginning:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, looking for differences:

Position 3: Wild has T, mutant1 has T. Wait, maybe looking at each nucleotide. Let me write the first 20 or so bases.

Wild: 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, wait. Let me count the letters.

Let me number the positions:

Wild:
1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: G
15: T
16: A
17: C
18: T
19: T
20: C
... And so on.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to align the sequences and see where the differences are.

Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking at the start:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, comparing after ATG:

Wild: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the first part:

Wild: positions 4-6: T T C (after ATG)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: T C T ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look at the exact positions where the sequences differ.

Looking at the two sequences:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Let me break it down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TGC G...

So, notice that in the wild type, after the first few nucleotides, there's a part where it changes. Let me see:

Wild:
positions 4-7: T T C T
Mutant1: T C T A ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the exact spots where the sequences diverge.

Looking at the full sequences:

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1:
