Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with potentials in different coordinate systems, especially polar coordinates, it's helpful to see if the problem separates into independent parts. 

The potential given is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, that looks like it's a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions because in 2D, the potential for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² r², but in the problem, it's given as (1/2)k r². Wait, so that term is a radial part, depending only on r. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which depends on both r and θ. Oh, but wait, that's actually dependent on cosθ squared, so maybe it can be expressed in terms of angular variables.

Wait, but in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be split into radial and angular parts if it's separable. But here, the first term is purely radial, but the second term has both r and θ. Hmm, so that complicates things because it affects both variables. But wait, maybe I can factor it differently. Let me think about if this can be written as a sum of functions each depending only on r or θ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of a radial part and an angular part. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out (1/2)k r²:

V = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that's because 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, but wait: 1/2 + 3/2 = 2. Wait no, 1/2 multiplied by (1 + 3 cos^2θ) gives 1/2*(1) + 1/2*(3 cos²θ) = 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ, which matches the original expression. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider whether this potential can be expressed as a sum of functions that are each separable into r and θ parts. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a central potential plus something else. The first term is a central (radial) potential, but the second term, (3/2)k r² cos²θ, can be rewritten using some trigonometric identity. 

Wait, cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me try that. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let's compute that: 

(3/2)k r² * (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) = (3/4
