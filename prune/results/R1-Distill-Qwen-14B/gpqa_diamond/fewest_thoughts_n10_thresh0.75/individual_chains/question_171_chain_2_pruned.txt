Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed for each substance. I need to arrange substances 1 to 6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the order is from the least para to the most para.

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. Each of these is benzene with a substituent. The substituent's nature will direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. So, for each substituent, I need to figure out if it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing.

But wait, in this reaction, since it's bromine in excess, it's probably a bromination reaction. So each substituent on benzene will influence where the Br adds.

So, each substituent directs the incoming Br either meta, ortho, para. Also, activating groups will increase the rate, deactivating will decrease.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, if a substituent is para directing, that would influence the major product to be para, right? Or maybe that's not the whole story, because some substituents may have different directing effects.

Wait, the directing effects influence the ratio of ortho, meta, para products. For example, a strong para-directing group would lead to more para product, but if the substituent is meta-directing, then the product would be meta.

So for each substituent, I'll determine if it's activating or deactivating, and the directing effect. Then, for each compound, I can figure out the major product(s) when brominated.

But wait, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which implies that perhaps the reaction is under conditions where only one position is substituted. Or maybe the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, it says each undergoes a reaction and only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps the reaction is highly selective, or the substituent makes only one position reactive.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me read the question again: "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, wait, maybe it's assuming that each substituent leads to only one possible product because of steric or electronic reasons. So for each of these, bromination leads to only one product. So I need to find which substituent would direct the bromine to para position, or ortho, or not.

Wait, but if a substituent is meta directing, then the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the substituent. So for each substituent, I need to determine whether the major product is para, meta, or ortho.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are activating, like -OCH3, they are ortho/para directors. So the incoming electrophile could go to both ortho and para. But if the substituent is strong enough, the para might be the major product because it's less hindered, especially if the substituent is in the para position.

Wait
