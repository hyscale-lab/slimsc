Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reagents are suitable for the given reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of addition reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide source, like NaCN, in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the cyanide ion attacks.

So for the first part, Reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, some options have H3O+ as A, others have NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, but I'm not sure about NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But in this context, maybe it's acting as an acid. So either could be a possibility. But I think the typical reagent for cyanohydrin formation is an aqueous solution with an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+.

The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense for a cyanohydrin. So A must be an acid catalyst. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So probably, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. Wait, how does that happen? Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, usually under strong acidic conditions. I remember that using HCl (HCl in H2O or in a solution) can act as an acid catalyst for such oxidations, but wait, what's the exact reagent for nitrile to acid?

Alternatively, I think the Hofmann or other oxidation conditions might be used. Wait, another method I recall is treating nitriles with a strong acid, like HCl, in water. That could hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst in the hydrolysis. But wait, nitrile hydrolysis usually requires more than just acid; sometimes it's done with a strong acid like HCl and heat, or maybe using a peracid? No, peracids might be for epoxidation or other oxidations.

Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid requires controlled oxidation. I think in acidic conditions, when a nitrile is treated with water and an acid catalyst, it can hydrolyze. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reagents. Another thought: maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis where the nitrile becomes an amide first, then a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps using a strong acid like HCl in H2O.

Looking back at the options for B: options A and C have B as HCl. Option B has B as CH3COOH, and D has HCl as B. Since HCl is a strong acid, it might be the right choice for the second step.

Wait, the second reaction is using B in H2O. So when the nitrile is treated with H2O and an acid, it's likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. But wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When you hydrolyze a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol, what happens? Oh, wait. The first product is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. Now, when that nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

So the second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The conditions for that are either under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely an acidic hydrolysis. So using HCl in water would make sense because HCl is a strong acid. So reagent B is HCl.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is using a peracid, but that's for epoxidation or for oxidizing alcohols. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and HCl, perhaps the nitrile is converted to the amide first, then to the acid. I'm not entirely sure, but I think for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you hydrolyze the nitrile with strong acid and heat. So reagent B would be HCl, which is option A or C.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

Wait, the first part requires H3O+ as A, so options A and B for A being H3O+.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl. So the correct option would be option A, where B is HCl.

Wait, let me double-check. The first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because H3O+ is the acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.

Second reaction: the nitrile is treated with HCl in H2O to produce the carboxylic acid. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options again:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl → This fits.

C) A= NaHSO3, B= HCl → But A is H3O+ in the first step, so option C is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for this step, while NaHSO₃ is less commonly used in this context. Therefore, A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. This is achieved through acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, where a strong acid like HCl in water facilitates the reaction. CH₃COOH, being a weaker acid, is less effective for this transformation. Thus, B must be HCl.

Combining these conclusions, the correct option is A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl.

Answer: A
