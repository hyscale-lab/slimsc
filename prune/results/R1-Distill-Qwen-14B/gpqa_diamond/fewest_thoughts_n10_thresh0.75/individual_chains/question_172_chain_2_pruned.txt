Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere emits light and the atoms there are in a state of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). That means the distribution of energy levels in the atoms follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level for star_1 is higher, which probably relates to its temperature. Oh wait, higher temperature would mean more excitation, right?

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I remember that the Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where N2 is the higher energy level.

In this case, the excited state is N2 and the lower state is N1. So for star_1, N2 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, the question says the excited level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But wait, actually, maybe it's that the ratio N2/N1 for star 1 is twice that of star 2's N2/N1 ratio. Or perhaps, N2/N1 for star 1 is 2 times that of star 2's. I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. So perhaps that means the excitation level (like the population in the upper state) is higher. So for star_1, the ratio of the upper level to lower level is higher than in star_2.

So let's model this. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = N2_1 / N1_1, and for star_2 as R2 = N2_2 / N1_2. The problem says R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait no, no, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so for each star, the ratio N2/N1 is given. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be that in star_1, the population of the higher energy level is twice that of star_2's in the same level. So N2_1 = 2 * N2_2, but I don't think that's necessarily the case because the total number of atoms would depend on other factors. So probably, the ratio N2/N1 is higher in star_1.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations is given by exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for each star, R = N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

So for star 1, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)).
Similarly, R2 =
