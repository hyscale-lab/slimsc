Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observations. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars are different. Hmm.

Wait, transiting probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for the probability of a planet transiting its star is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by the (sin i)² term. Wait, but the orbital inclination i... if the orbit is edge-on, it transits. So the probability is the chance that the inclination is 90 degrees. 

But wait, I think the probability of transit is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (a_planet / (R_star))), no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh, no, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(e^2 + (1 + (R_p/r)^2)^(1/2))) ), but wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + R_p / (a * sin i)) )) ? No, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 / (1 + (a/(R_s)) ), but that doesn't seem right either. Oh wait, perhaps I should think geometric
