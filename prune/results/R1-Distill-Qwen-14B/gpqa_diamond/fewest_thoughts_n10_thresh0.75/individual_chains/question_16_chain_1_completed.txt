Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's a chiral center—so a carbon attached to four different groups.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure has a double bond at position 1. So it's like Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on carbon 1, which is double bonded to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has a methyl group. Let me draw this out. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure is Cl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C2. So, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? Wait, wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, but-1-ene has four carbons. So, maybe it's Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So, the structure would be Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but that would be 2-methyl-1-chloro-1-propene, but I'm not getting the right structure. Alternatively, maybe but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl, but that's 4-chlorobut-1-ene, not 1-chloro.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. For a chiral center, you need four different groups attached to a carbon. In this molecule, if the Cl is on C1, which is part of a double bond, then that carbon is sp² hybridized. So it can't be a chiral center because it's trigonal planar. So no chiral center here. Also, even if there's a double bond, unless there's a stereogenic center, the molecule won't be chiral. Wait, but wait the question is about optical activity, which can also come from other sources like allenes or planar chirality, but I think that's more advanced. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's parse the structure. Methanoisobenzofuran is a fused ring system, right? So, it's a bicyclic compound, with a furan ring fused to a benzene? Or maybe a benzofuran. The substituents are E configuration, chloromethylene group. So, the chlorine is on a methylene group that's part of a double bond. Wait, methylene is CH2, but chloromethylene is Cl-CH2-?

Wait, no, chloromethylene would be CH2Cl, but in a double bond. So, it's CH2Cl double bonded somewhere. Wait, but as part of a substituent. So, maybe the structure has a double bond with Cl on one end and something else on the other. So, the molecule has a double bond with E configuration. But E or Z refers to the arrangement around the double bond, not necessarily to a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The substituents are (3aR,7aS). So, those would be stereocenters. So, the molecule has two stereocenters, which are R and S configurations. So, if the molecule has stereocenters, even if it's a bicyclic structure, it can still be chiral. So, unless those stereocenters are in a plane of symmetry or something, but given the substituents, it's likely that they create a chiral molecule. So, this compound is optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, when you have 2,3-dimethyl, that's methyl groups on the second and third carbons. The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at the central carbons (C2 and C3). C2 has groups: R configuration, which is (CH(CH3)), so attached to C2 are two CH2 groups (from the succinic acid chain), the methyl, and the COOH group. Wait, but wait, the central CH(CH3) on C2—does it have four different groups? Let me think.

Wait, C2 in succinic acid is CH2, but with a methyl substituent. So, C2: attached to two CH2 groups (from the COOH groups on either side?), a methyl, and another CH(CH3)? Or wait, maybe I should draw it out. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the structure is symmetrical around the central two carbons. Each of the C2 and C3 carbons have the same substituents. So, for C2, the groups are: the succinic acid chain (left and right), a methyl, and a CH(CH3)(COOH) group? Wait, no. Wait, each C2 and C3 are each connected to two CH2 groups (from the succinic acid backbone), but with each also having a methyl. So, for C2: the substituents are a methyl, a hydrogen (from the CH2 group?), and the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the C2 has the groups: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So, for C2: COOH–, CH(CH3)–, CH3–, H–. So, four different groups? COOH is one, CH(CH3) is another, CH3 is the third, H is the fourth. So yes, that's a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has the same situation. But wait, wait: if both C2 and C3 are chiral centers, and the configuration is (2R,3S), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The two CH(CH3) groups are on adjacent carbons. So, it's like a meso compound. If the configurations are R and S, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might actually be achiral, making it a meso compound. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, even with stereocenters, it won't be optically active. So in this case, if the configurations are (R,S), with the structure being symmetrical, it's a meso compound. So, no optical activity. Wait, but wait: the structure is symmetric, right? So, the two stereocenters are mirror images. So, the molecule would be achiral. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Same structure as the previous one, but with R,R configuration. Again, looking at the structure, is it a meso compound? Let's see. If both C2 and C3 are R configuration, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Because both are R, which would make the molecule chiral. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If both C2 and C3 are R, then in the mirror image, they would be S and S. So, the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Because if you mirror the molecule, you get the opposite configuration. So, the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical activity. So, this compound is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So, cyclohexanol with the hydroxyl group on C1, and a double bond at position 3. Structure-wise, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The cyclohexene ring has one double bond. The hydroxyl is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4 (since numbering starts at the OH group). So, the structure would have the OH on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. Now, is there a chiral center here? The OH is on C1, which is connected to C2 and C6, and perhaps another substituent. Wait, in cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others. So, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 has OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and a CH group (from the double bond). Wait, perhaps I should imagine the chair or boat conformation, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, the molecule could have a stereocenter at C1. Let me think: the groups attached to C1 would be OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and the double bond (which is connected to C3). Wait, but wait, the C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (each CH2 groups), and also to C3 (which is part of the double bond, so a CH- group). So, are the substituents on C1 four different groups? If so, then it would be a chiral center. So, let's list the groups:

- OH group (distinct)
- CH2-CH2– (from C2 and C6), but wait, they're each connected to two CH2 groups, but perhaps they are the same. So, if C2 and C6 are each CH2 groups, then C1 would have two identical groups, making it a stereocenter only if the other groups are different.

Wait, wait: C1 in cyclohexane (before substitution) is connected to two CH2 groups. But with substitution, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has:

- OH
- CH2 (connected to C2)
- CH (connected to C3, which is part of the double bond)
- CH2 (connected to C6)

Wait, but are the two CH2 groups attached to C1 the same? If the ring is such that C2 and C6 are equivalent, then the two CH2 groups would be identical. So, that would mean that C1 has three different groups: OH, CH2 (twice?), and CH (from C3). But wait, three different groups? No, wait, no. If two groups are the same (the two CH2), then it's three different substituents plus the same group. So, C1 would have:

- OH
- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C6)
- CH (C3)

But if C2 and C6 are equivalent, then the two CH2 groups are the same. So, C1 has three substituents: OH, CH2 (two identical), and CH. So, that would be three different groups plus a duplicate. But for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So, in this case, C1 has two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups). So, it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical activity. Wait, but wait, the question is about (R) configuration. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring is such that the C1 is connected to four different groups. Because the ring's substituents might make that possible. For example, if the ring is not symmetric in a way that makes the CH2 groups the same. Wait, but in cyclohexene, the ring would have a certain geometry. Let me think: cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be:

Positions:
1: OH
2: CH2
3: double bond (CH-CH)
4: double bond (CH-CH)
5: CH2
6: CH2
Wait, but looking at C1, it's connected to C2 and C6, which are CH2 groups, and to C3, which is part of a double bond. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C6)
- CH (C3)

So, C3 is connected to C4 via a double bond, so the substituent is CH.

So, are any of these substituents the same? The two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) could be different if the ring isn't symmetric. But in a cyclohexene, the substituents around the ring can lead to different configurations. Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the ring is such that the substituents adjacent to the double bond would make the molecule non-symmetrical. So, perhaps the C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Because if the groups on C1 are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (from C3), and if C2 and C6 are not equivalent (due to the double bond), then the two CH2 groups would be different. So, for example, C2 is next to C3 (double bond), while C6 is next to C5, which is a CH2. So, perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different. So, that would make C1 a chiral center. Then, the (R) configuration indicates a chiral center, so the molecule has optical activity. So, this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents can have different environments. So, in this case, the C1 has an OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH (from the double bond). If the two CH2 groups are in different environments (like if the ring isn't symmetric), then they are different. So, that would mean four different substituents on C1, making it a chiral center. So, the molecule would have optical activity. So, this compound is active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, three hydroxyl groups on carbons 1,3,5 of cyclohexane. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on every other carbon. Now, does this create a chiral center? Each of the OH-bearing carbons (1,3,5) would have four different substituents? Let's check C1. It's connected to C2 and C6, both of which are CH2 groups (since the other positions are 3 and 5, but wait, are those OH-bearing? Wait, each OH is on 1,3,5. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- An OH group
- The rest would be the ring's structure. Wait, perhaps that's not enough. Let me think: each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons (the adjacent ones) and two hydrogens. So, for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), but are they the same? If the ring is symmetric, perhaps. Because if the ring has OHs on 1,3,5, then the substituents across the ring would be symmetric. So, for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- CH2-OH (C2)
- CH2-OH (C6)
Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 has an OH. So, C2 is CH2-OH (because C3 is OH). Similarly, C6 is connected to C1 and C5, which has an OH. So, C6 is CH2-OH. So, for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- CH2-OH (C2)
- CH2-OH (C6)
- And another CH2 group? Or maybe the position of the substituents makes them different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the cyclohexane ring. Positions 1,3,5 have OH groups. So, C1 is next to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 (OH) and C3 (OH). So, C2 is CH2-OH (because C2 is between C1 (OH) and C3 (OH)). Similarly, C6 is connected to C1 (OH) and C5 (OH), so it's CH2-OH.

So, substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Two CH2-OH groups (from C2 and C6)
- And perhaps another substituent. Wait, no, in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two hydrogen atoms. Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in cyclohexane is CH2 if unsubstituted, but in this case, the substituents are the hydroxyl groups. So, C1 has an OH, and is connected to C2 and C6, which are each CH2-OH groups. Wait, no, C2 has an OH on C3, not on itself. Wait, no, wait: the substituents are on 1,3,5. So, C2 is between C1 (OH) and C3 (OH). So, C2 is a CH2 group because it's not substituted. So, substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And another CH2 group (since the ring's structure is such that each carbon is connected to two others). Wait, no, each carbon in cyclohexane has two adjacent carbons. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So, substituents on C1 are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and the other substituent is the ring's structure. Wait, perhaps the fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Or wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexane ring is a six-membered ring where each carbon is bonded to two others. So, for each carbon, the substituents are two adjacent carbons (each CH2), an OH, and a hydrogen? No, because in this case, C1 has OH, so the substituents are: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? So, substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C6)
- H

Are any of these substituents the same? The two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) may be in different environments. Because C2 is next to C3 (OH), while C6 is next to C5 (OH). So, perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different. So, four different groups: OH, CH2-C3 (OH), CH2-C5 (OH), and H. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would also have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But wait, the question is about whether the molecule as a whole is chiral. If all three OHs are in a symmetric arrangement, maybe the molecule is achiral. But with three stereocenters all in the same configuration (s,s,s), could that lead to a meso compound? Or is it a case of a plane of symmetry?

Wait, the molecule is cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all OH groups on the same face, perhaps. If all the OHs are in the same configuration (like all axial or all equatorial), but in this case, the molecule has (1s,3s,5s) configuration. Wait, but whether it's a meso compound or not. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound and thus achiral. Let's see. In a cyclohexane ring with OHs on 1,3,5 positions, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring. So, each OH would have a mirror image on the opposite side. So, if all the OHs are on one face (like all axial), then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, for (1s,3s,5s), perhaps the molecule is symmetric and thus achiral. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, this compound could be chiral if the arrangement doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if the configuration of the stereocenters leads to a molecule that's not symmetric, then it would be chiral. So, if all three stereocenters are (s), but the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry of the ring makes the molecule achiral. So, in this case, since the substituents are on 1,3,5, which are symmetrically placed, the molecule could be a meso compound, making it achiral. So, this compound doesn't show optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone, with a methyl group on the third carbon. Structure: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no. Butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-R. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-R? No, wait, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2C(O)R? Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-R. Alternatively, wait, butanone is usually butan-2-one, but the question specifies butan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is on carbon 1. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cyclopentyl. Wait, no: the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl?

Wait, maybe it's:

Butan-1-one: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at position 1 (cyclopentyl) and position 3 (methyl). So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl?

Wait, perhaps I should represent it as:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9 (cyclopentyl group).

Wait, but that would make the structure O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

So, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl is on C1. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp² hybridized. It's not a chiral center. Now, look at the other carbons.

C2: connected to O=C, CH2, and another CH2 from C3. So, groups are: O=C, CH3 (from C3?), no, wait, C3 has a methyl. Let me see:

C1: O=C,

C2: connected to C1, C3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let's detail:

Structure: O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

So, C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (O=C), and C3 (CH(CH3)), and two H's.

Wait, no. Let me number from the carbonyl:

1: O=C-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, that can't be right. Butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So, structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R? Wait, but the substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Wait, position 1 is the carbonyl, so the substituent is cyclopentyl, and position 3 is methyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

So, the carbons are 1 (O=C), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2-Cyclopentyl).

So, looking for chiral centers in this structure.

C2: groups are O=C, two CH2, and a CH(CH3). So, substituents: O=C, CH2 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and perhaps another group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's list substituents for each carbon:

C2: attached to O=C (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and two H's. So, substituents are O=C-CH2, CH2-CH(CH3), and two H's. So, that's only two different groups? No, wait, maybe not. Wait, C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (O=C) and C3 (CH(CH3)). So, groups on C2 are: O=C-CH2, CH(CH3)-CH2, and two H's. So, substituents are O=C-CH2, CH2-CH(CH3), and two H's. So, that's three substituents. So, no, it's not a chiral center.

C3: attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and a methyl group. So, substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and the other substituent is the connection to C3 itself. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: C3 is CH(CH3). So, substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- And the connection to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, but for a chiral center, it needs four different substituents. So, for C3:

- Group 1: CH2 (from C2)
- Group 2: CH2 (from C4)
- Group 3: CH3
- Group 4: the cyclopentyl group via C4? No, that's not right. Wait, C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl. So, C3 is connected to C4 via CH2. So, the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C4)
- CH3
- And perhaps another CH2? Wait, no, C3 is CH(CH3), so substituents are:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C4)
- CH3
- And a hydrogen? Because it's CH(CH3). Wait, no—it's CH(CH3), so it's connected to three substituents: two CH2 groups and a CH3. So, the fourth substituent would be a hydrogen. So, substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- H

So, four different substituents? Let me see: CH2 (C2) and CH2 (C4) might be the same if the structure is symmetric. But in this case, C4 is connected to a cyclopentyl group, while C2 is connected to the carbonyl. So, the two CH2 groups are different because their adjacent atoms are different. So, C3 has four different substituents: two different CH2 groups, CH3, and H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. Thus, this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The groups on C3:

- One is connected to C2, which is O=C-CH2-
- Another is connected to C4, which is CH2-Cyclopentyl
- Then, a methyl group
- And a hydrogen.

So, yes, four different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So, this compound is optically active.

Now, let's count how many compounds are optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So, the active ones are 2,4,5,7. That's four compounds.

Wait, but wait. Did I get all correct?

Wait, compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Earlier I thought that C1 might be a chiral center, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me reevaluate.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with OH on C1, and double bond between C3 and C4. So, C1's substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (C2)
- CH (C3, double bond)
- CH2 (C6)

If the two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) are in different environments, then the substituents on C1 are four different groups. So, that would make C1 a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and optically active. So, yes, it counts.

So, the active compounds are 2,4,5,7: four in total.

So, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So, the answer is D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits chirality through other means, such as planar chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond at position 1, and the carbon at position 1 is sp² hybridized. Since sp² carbons cannot be chiral centers, this compound lacks chirality and is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, with specified R and S configurations. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral, and it is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The structure of this compound is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The central carbons (C2 and C3) are stereocenters, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral, so this compound is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has the same structure as the previous one but with both stereocenters (C2 and C3) in the R configuration. The lack of a plane of symmetry makes this molecule chiral, and it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1. The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: OH, two CH₂ groups (C2 and C6), and a CH group (C3). This makes it a chiral center, and the compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of a cyclohexane ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Despite the stereocenters, the molecule is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
