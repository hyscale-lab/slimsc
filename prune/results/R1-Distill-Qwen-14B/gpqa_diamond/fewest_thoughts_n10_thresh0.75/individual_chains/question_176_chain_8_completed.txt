Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that can't be right because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized. Oh, wait, maybe the vector is (-1, 2, 1) but it's not normalized yet. So I might need to normalize it when calculating probabilities.

Then there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as square matrices. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down.

P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And Q's matrix is diagonal:
1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure P and then Q, the state changes after the first measurement. Because when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable.

So the process is:

1. Measure P. Get outcome 0. Find the state after this measurement.
2. Then measure Q on this new state. Get outcome -1. Find the probability of this happening.

The overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, assuming the first measurement outcome affects the second.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with probabilities, perhaps I should look for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P and Q.

Wait, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the system collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, let's see. The observable P's matrix is P, and Q's matrix is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if it's normalized. The sum of squares is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ) when normalized.

But wait, the question says the state is the column matrix (-1,2,1). So perhaps it's unnormalized? Or maybe I should proceed with the unnormalized vector but remember to normalize when calculating probabilities.

I think in quantum mechanics, all state vectors must be normalized, so I should normalize this vector. So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Now, first, I need to measure P. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P? Let's find them.

Matrix P is:
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)   0       ]
[1/sqrt(2) 0        1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)   0       ]

To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - λI) = 0.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ        (1/√2)      0       |
| (1/√2)   -λ       (1/√2) | = 0
| 0        (1/√2)    -λ      |

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me compute the determinant.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) , ... Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found with the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me do cofactor expansion along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det [ [-λ , 1/√2],
            [1/√2, -λ ] ]

- (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2],
                [0, -λ ] ]

+ 0 * ... (third term which is zero)

So the determinant is:

-λ [ (λ^2) - (1/√2)^2 ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ]

Simplify each part:

First term: -λ (λ^2 - 1/2 )

Second term: - (1/√2) * ( -λ /√2 ) = - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) ) = ( λ / 2 )

So the determinant is:

-λ ( λ^2 - 1/2 ) + λ/2 = 0

Let's expand the first term:

-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2 = 0

Wait, -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor:

-λ (λ^2 - 1 ) = 0 → λ( λ^2 -1 ) = 0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So when measuring P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The system starts in a state |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The probability of getting outcome 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state |ψ>.

So I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for P =0.

We solve (P - 0 I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix P is as before.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from Row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So let's choose v3 = a, then v1= -a. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (-1,0,1). Let me check.

Wait, let me write the eigenvector as a vector: [v1, v2, v3]^T.

So v2=0, v1 = -v3. So the vector is (-v3, 0, v3) = v3*(-1, 0, 1). So the eigenvectors are multiples of (-1,0,1).

We can normalize this. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So, the eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = ( -1, 0, 1 )^T / sqrt(2).

So, the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is |<e0 | ψ>|^2.

Our state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

So the inner product is:

( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + (0) * (2)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1)/sqrt(6 )

Which is [ (1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ 1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's 2/(sqrt(12)) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3), and the square is 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me re-calculate that inner product correctly.

Wait, the state |e0> is (-1,0,1)^T / sqrt(2).

The state |ψ> is (-1,2,1)^T / sqrt(6).

So <e0 | ψ> is [ (-1)/sqrt(2) * (-1)/sqrt(6) ) + 0*(2)/sqrt(6) + (1)/sqrt(2) * (1)/sqrt(6) ].

So each term:

First term: (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = same as first term.

So total is (1 +1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3.

Now, upon measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenvector |e0>, which is (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2).

Now, after this, we measure Q. We need the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

What's Q's matrix? It's diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0,-1]. So the eigenvalues are 1,0,-1.

So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, since it's diagonal.

So, the eigenvector for Q=1 is (1,0,0)^T.

For Q=0: any vector in the second component, but since the matrix has the second row all zero, any vector with v2=0 is in the null space? Wait, the eigenvalue 0 for Q has eigenvectors in the second component, because Q acting on (0,1,0) is zero.

Wait, no. Q is a diagonal matrix with 1,0,-1. So the eigenvalues are 1,0,-1.

The eigenvectors are:

For Q=1: (1,0,0).

For Q=0: (0,1,0).

For Q=-1: (0,0,1).

So, to find the probability of measuring Q=-1 after the state has collapsed to |e0>, which is (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2), we need to compute the inner product of |e0> with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1).

So the inner product is:

< (0,0,1) | e0 > = (0)*(-1) + 0*(0) + 1*(1) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(1)) )

Wait, |e0> is (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2), and the Q eigenvector is (0,0,1).

So the inner product is (0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) ) / sqrt(2) = (1)/sqrt(2).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.

Now, the overall probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities.

So that's (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a minute. No, because the second measurement (Q) depends on the state after the first measurement. So the first measurement outcome affects the state for the second measurement.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability that, given the state is |e0>, measuring Q gives -1 (which is 1/2). So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Another approach: the combined probability is the square of the amplitude of the state that corresponds to both P=0 and Q=-1.

But I think that approach might not be applicable because P and Q aren't necessarily commuting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1/6 because 1/3 multiplied by 1/2 is 1/6.

But wait, let me think again.

When you measure P first, you get outcome 0 with probability 1/3, and the state becomes |e0>. Then, when you measure Q, you get -1 with probability 1/2.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer should be option D, which is 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the scenario step-by-step:

1. **State Vector Normalization**:  
   The given state vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). Its norm is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \). Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:  
   The matrix for \( P \) is:  
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix} 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), the eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \).  
   For \( P = 0 \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing, the eigenvector is:  
   \[
   |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |e_0\rangle \):  
   \[
   P(P=0) = |\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle|^2.
   \]  
   Compute \( \langle e_0 | \psi \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( P(P=0) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   Upon measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

5. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)**:  
   The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:  
   \[
   Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -1 
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   The eigenvalues are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors:  
   \[
   |q_1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |q_0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

6. **Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)**:  
   The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |e_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):  
   \[
   P(Q=-1) = |\langle q_{-1} | e_0 \rangle|^2.
   \]  
   Compute \( \langle q_{-1} | e_0 \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle q_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( P(Q=-1) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).

7. **Combined Probability**:  
   The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:  
   \[
   P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
   \]

**Conclusion**: The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
