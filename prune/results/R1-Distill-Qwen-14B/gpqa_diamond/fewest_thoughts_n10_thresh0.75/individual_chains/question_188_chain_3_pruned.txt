Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography and interplanar distances. Hmm, I remember that interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in a crystal, but the interplanar distance is the spacing between crystal planes. Alright, the question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... aren't those a type of hexagonal system? Or maybe it's a cubic system? No, wait, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. I think it's a special case where all edges are equal, but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. So in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal (either all acute or all obtuse). In this case, the angles are 30 degrees each.

But wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Oh, wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length 'a' because the atoms are at the corners. But in rhombohedral, the situation might be a bit different because of the angles. So each edge is 'a', but the angles between edges are 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cos²θ), where θ is the angle between the edges. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach is to use the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system.

I remember that for a general cubic system (which rhombohedral is a subset of), the interplanar distance formula is: d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk + 2kl + 2lh) cos α ), but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the dot product of the unit vectors.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2
