Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I need to think carefully.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. They give me the angular size of its event horizon and the distance to the galaxy. Hmm, okay. Let me jot down the given information first.

So, the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec? Oh right, a parsec is a unit of distance. 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years. But for calculations, I probably need to convert it into meters because entropy formulas usually use SI units. Oh right, 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So 10^10 parsecs would be 3.086e16 * 1e10 = 3.086e26 meters. Let me check that again. Yeah, 10^10 parsecs is d = 3.086e26 m.

The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Oh wait, that's a very small angle. I remember that when dealing with angular sizes, we often use the approximation that for small angles in radians, θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side length / hypotenuse. So I think θ (radians) ≈ r = (size of object) / d, but actually wait, the size of the object is the diameter of the event horizon. Right. So the event horizon's size is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2GM/c². But maybe I can find the radius another way using the given angle.

Wait, the event horizon's angular size θ is given. So the formula connecting angular size, distance, and actual size is: θ ≈ (diameter of event horizon) / d. Because for small angles, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance. But wait, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians first. Because 1 degree is π/180 radians.

So let's compute θ in radians. θ = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈
