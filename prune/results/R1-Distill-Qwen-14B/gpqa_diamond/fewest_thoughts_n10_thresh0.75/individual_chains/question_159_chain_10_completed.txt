Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. But wait, why does that matter? Oh right, I think this might be related to redshift because quasars are very distant objects, and their light gets redshifted as it travels through the expanding universe.

So, the peak at 790 nm—what does that correspond to? Oh, right! In the rest frame of the quasar, the emission line we're seeing (like maybe the Lyman-alpha line or something else) would have a shorter wavelength. Let's think, for example, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, that's when the universe was young. If the quasar's emission is observed at 790 nm, that's way longer, so it's been redshifted a lot.

But wait, the question gives the current Hubble constant as 70 km/s/Mpc, and the matter and dark energy densities as 0.3 and 0.7 respectively. It's a flat universe, so the geometry is flat.

We need to find the comoving distance for a=1 (which is the current scale factor, so the distance now) to the quasar. The options are A) 6 Gpc, B) 8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, comoving distance D_C is the distance between two points separated by a certain comoving scale factor. For a quasar at high redshift z, the comoving distance can be calculated using integrals over the expansion history.

But I think there's a formula that relates the luminosity distance or the comoving distance to the redshift. Alternatively, perhaps this is about the age of the universe for a given redshift, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm. If the rest wavelength is, say, 121 nm, then the redshift z can be calculated as (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121)/121 = (669)/121 ≈5.529. So z is around 5.5. That's a pretty high redshift.

But wait, the question doesn't specify which emission line it is. Oh, but if the peak is in the near infrared, maybe it's something like the Balmer break or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm) Lyman limit, but I'm not sure. Wait, 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms. Hmm, maybe another line. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the host galaxy's emission, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the redshift calculation. Let's assume that the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. So observed at 790 nm, so z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ 668.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z≈5.5.

Now, I need to compute the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a flat universe with H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7.

The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r*(1+z')^4 + Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

But wait, in this case, since Ω_r (radiation density) is negligible at z=5.5, because matter and dark energy dominate. So E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

Wait, but wait, wait. When z is large, the matter term (which scales as (1+z)^3) can be more important. So let's compute E(z) at various points. Alternatively, perhaps using an approximation for high z.

Alternatively, there might be a standard formula or look-up table for the comoving distance given these parameters.

I'm a bit rusty on the exact integral, but I remember that for a flat universe dominated by dark energy (which it is here, since Ω_Λ=0.7 is larger than Ω_m=0.3), the comoving distance increases roughly with the integral of 1/E(z) dz.

But to calculate this, I think I need to compute the integral, maybe using some approximation or using an online calculator, but since I can't do that, perhaps I should remember some approximate values.

Wait, I think for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.5 Gpc when H0 is 70. But for higher z, it increases. Wait, z=5.5 is way bigger, so the distance must be much larger.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The comoving distance isn't just proportional to z. Because at high z, the expansion history changes. For a matter-dominated universe (Ω_m=1, Ω_Λ=0), the comoving distance for z is (c/H0) * (2/(3(1+z)^1.5 -1)).

But in our case, the universe is dark energy dominated at late times. So perhaps the comoving distance is less than what it would be in a matter-only universe, because dark energy accelerates expansion, making the universe expand faster, which reduces the comoving distance for a given z compared to a matter-only universe.

Wait, no. Wait, for a given redshift, a universe dominated by dark energy has a higher expansion rate at later times, but I'm not sure how that affects the integral for comoving distance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about approximate values. Let me consider that for z=2, the comoving distance with these parameters is approximately 3 Gpc. For z=5, perhaps around 8 Gpc? Wait, because at higher redshifts, the comoving distance increases, but the expansion is faster, so the increase isn't linear.

Alternatively, I might have read that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, H0=70, the comoving distance for z=5 is about 10 Gpc. But that might be the luminosity distance, not comoving.

Wait, the comoving distance is the luminosity distance divided by (1+z), right? Because D_L = (1+z) * D_C. So if D_L is about 10*(1+5)=60 Gpc, then D_C would be about 12 Gpc. But that seems high.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) times the comoving distance D_C. So D_L = (1+z) * D_C.

So if I can find D_L, I can find D_C by dividing by (1+z).

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The luminosity distance is given by:

D_L = a_0 * r, where r is the comoving radial coordinate (which is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 E(z')) dt, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up a table or approximate calculation.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given H0, the comoving distance D_C scales as (c/H0) multiplied by some function that depends on the cosmological parameters.

Let me think: c is about 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. That's about 4.2857 Gpc.

So c/H0 ≈ 4.2857 Gpc.

But the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/E(z) dz, so D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

So for z=5.5, I need to compute this integral.

But doing this integral exactly is time-consuming, but perhaps I can approximate it.

Alternatively, I can use an approximate formula or use an online calculator. Since I can't do that right now, perhaps I can think of standard values.

Wait, looking for some rough numbers. For example, for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=1 is about 1.8 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier I thought for z=1, D_C is around 1.5 Gpc, but maybe I'm wrong. Let's think more carefully.

Wait, the standard formula for comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

Or more accurately, E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r(1+z)^4 + Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_k (1+z)^2 + Ω_Λ). But for a flat universe, Ω_r is negligible at high z, and Ω_k = 0.

So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

So for z=5.5, let's try to compute the integral ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'.

Hmm, this is a tough integral. Let's approximate it by breaking it into parts.

At high z, 0.3*(1+z')^3 is larger than 0.7, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3) = sqrt(0.3) * (1+z')^(3/2).

So, for z' >> (0.7/0.3)^(1/3) ≈ (2.333)^(1/3) ≈ 1.32, the matter term dominates. So for z' > ~1.3, we can approximate E(z) ~ (1+z')^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3).

So let's split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1.3, where dark energy is significant, and from 1.3 to 5.5, where matter dominates.

But without exact calculations, perhaps I can estimate the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a lookup table or an approximate formula. I remember that for high redshifts, the integral can be approximated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation method from Hogg's 1999 paper on distance measures. Let's think.

Hogg's formula for comoving distance:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z)

With E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)

For a given z, we can approximate the integral numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator.

Wait, but since this is a thought process, perhaps I can approximate the integral by finding the average of 1/E(z) over the range.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an online cosmology calculator and plug in z=5.5, H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, and see what the comoving distance is.

But since I can't access that, I'll have to proceed with an estimate.

Let me consider that for high z, the integral behaves as:

∫(0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ) ≈ ∫(from a to z) dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3)

= ∫(from a to z) dz' / [sqrt(Ω_m) (1+z')^(3/2)]

= (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) ∫(from a to z) (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

= (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ 2 (1+z)^(-1/2) - 2 (1+a)^(-1/2) ) ]

If a is much less than z, then it's approximately 2 (1+z)^(-1/2) / sqrt(Ω_m).

So for z=5.5, E(z) is dominated by the matter term, so:

Integral ≈ 2 (1 + 5.5)^(-1/2) / sqrt(0.3)

= 2 * (6.5)^(-0.5) / sqrt(0.3)

6.5^0.5 is about 2.55, so 2 / 2.55 ≈ 0.784, divided by sqrt(0.3)=0.5477, so 0.784/0.5477≈1.433.

Multiply by (c/H0) which is about 4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C ≈ 4.2857 * 1.433 ≈ 6.14 Gpc.

Wait, but that's only the part from z=1.3 to 5.5. What about from 0 to 1.3?

Hmm, maybe for z from 0 to 1.3, the dark energy term is significant, so E(z) is less than what it would be in a matter-dominated universe.

In a matter-dominated universe (Ω_Λ=0), the integral would be:

∫0^z dz' / [sqrt(Ω_m) (1+z')^(3/2)] = 2 [ (1+z)^(-1/2) - 1 ] / sqrt(Ω_m)

At z=1.3, that would be 2 (1/(sqrt(2.3)) -1 ) / sqrt(0.3).

sqrt(2.3) ≈ 1.5166, so 1/1.5166 ≈ 0.6598.

So 2 (0.6598 -1 ) / 0.5477 = 2 (-0.3402) /0.5477 ≈ (-0.6804)/0.5477 ≈ -1.242.

Wait, that can't be right because the integral from 0 to 1.3 is positive. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a matter-only universe, E(z)=sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3), so the integral from 0 to z is 2/(sqrt(0.3)) ) [ (1+z)^(-1/2) -1 ].

At z=1.3, that would be 2/(0.5477) [ (2.3)^(-0.5) -1 ].

Which is (3.65) [ (0.6598) -1 ] = 3.65 * (-0.3402) ≈ -1.242. Wait, that can't be right because the integral is positive.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-derive.

The integral ∫ dz'/(sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3)) ) = ∫ dz'/(sqrt(Ω_m) (1+z')^(3/2)) )

= 1/sqrt(Ω_m) ∫ dz' (1+z')^(-3/2)

Let u = 1 + z', du = dz'

Integral becomes (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) ∫ u^(-3/2) du from u=1 to u=1+z.

Which is (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ (-2) u^(-1/2) ) ] from 1 to 1+z.

= (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2/1 ]

= 2 (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

So for the matter-dominated case, the integral from 0 to z is 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)] / sqrt(Ω_m).

At z=1.3, the integral is 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(2.3)] / sqrt(0.3).

= 2 [1 - 0.6598 ] / 0.5477 = 2 (0.3402) / 0.5477 ≈ 0.6804 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.242.

So the integral from 0 to z=1.3 is about 1.242.

But in our case, the universe isn't matter-only. So during the interval from 0 to 1.3, dark energy is contributing, which makes E(z) lower than in a matter-only universe, so the integrand 1/E(z) is larger. That means the integral from 0 to 1.3 would be larger than 1.242.

Similarly, the integral from 1.3 to 5.5 is about 1.433 as I calculated earlier.

So total integral ≈ 1.242 + 1.433 ≈ 2.675.

Multiply by (c/H0)=4.2857 Gpc: 4.2857 * 2.675 ≈ 11.44 Gpc.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for z=1, the integral is about... Well, for z=1, the integral from 0 to 1 would be... Let me compute it.

At z=1, for the matter-dominated case, the integral is 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(2)] / sqrt(0.3).

sqrt(2)≈1.4142, so 1/sqrt(2)=0.7071. So 1 - 0.7071=0.2929.

So 2*0.2929 ≈0.5858, divided by 0.5477 → 0.5858/0.5477≈1.07.

But in reality, since dark energy is non-zero, the integral is larger. So for z=1, D_C would be (c/H0) * [integral] =4.2857 * [integral].

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that at high redshifts, the comoving distance for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7 is roughly proportional to (c/H0) multiplied by the integral of 1/E(z) dz, which for z=5.5 is about 2. Let's say (c/H0)*2. So 4.2857 * 2 ≈8.57 Gpc.

Wait, but my earlier rough calculation gave around 11 Gpc, which is larger than the options given, which are up to 9 Gpc. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator approximation:

Using the approximation from Hogg's paper, or using a calculator, for z=5.5, H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance is about 9.3 Gpc. So looking at the options, the closest is option C)9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the luminosity distance. Wait, for z=5.5, the luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C, which would be 6.5 * 9.3 ≈60 Gpc, which is a very large distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the age of the universe at z=5.5. But that's not directly needed here.

Wait, but looking back, the question is about the comoving distance, not the luminosity distance. So the options are about 6,7,8,9 Gpc. If my rough estimate is around 9 Gpc, then the answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the age of the universe. Wait, the age of the universe at z=5.5 would be t(z) = 1/(H0) ∫0^z dz' / [ (1+z') E(z') ].

But that's for the age, not the comoving distance.

Wait, but perhaps for the comoving distance, I can look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance can be calculated using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z)

With E(z) as before.

So I'll try to compute this integral numerically.

Let me split the integral into small steps.

But given time constraints, perhaps I can do a rough approximation.

Let me pick a few z' values and compute 1/E(z').

Compute E(z'):

At z' =0: E= sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1.

At z'=1: E= sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)= sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.760.

At z'=2: E= sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)= sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966.

z'=3: E= sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=4.461.

z'=4: E= sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)=sqrt(37.5 +0.7)=sqrt(38.2)=6.18.

z'=5: E= sqrt(0.3*(125+5^3=125? Wait, (1+5)=6, so (1+5)^3=216. So 0.3*216=64.8 +0.7=65.5. sqrt(65.5)=8.093.

z'=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875 +0.7=83.0875. sqrt(83.0875)=9.115.

So now, to compute ∫0^5.5 dz' / E(z').

I'll approximate the integral by the sum of the function at midpoints multiplied by the step. Let's choose a step of 1. So the points are 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5,4.5,5.5.

Compute E(z') at these midpoints:

z'=0.5: (1.5)^3=3.375. 0.3 *3.375=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125. sqrt(1.7125)=1.309.

z'=1.5: (2.5)^3=15.625. 0.3*15.625=4.6875 +0.7=5.3875. sqrt(5.3875)=2.321.

z'=2.5: (3.5)^3=42.875. 0.3*42.875=12.8625 +0.7=13.5625. sqrt=3.682.

z'=3.5: (4.5)^3=91.125. 0.3*91.125=27.3375 +0.7=28.0375. sqrt=5.295.

z'=4.5: (5.5)^3=166.375. 0.3*166.375=49.9125 +0.7=50.6125. sqrt=7.115.

z'=5.5: done earlier, E=9.115.

Now, the midpoints from 0 to 5.5 in steps of 1, we have 6 points (0.5,1.5,...5.5). So the step size Δz=1.

The sum is:

(1/1.309) + (1/2.321) + (1/3.682) + (1/5.295) + (1/7.115) + (1/9.115)

Calculate each term:

1/1.309≈0.764,

1/2.321≈0.431,

1/3.682≈0.272,

1/5.295≈0.189,

1/7.115≈0.140,

1/9.115≈0.109.

Adding them up: 0.764 +0.431=1.195; +0.272=1.467; +0.189=1.656; +0.140=1.796; +0.109=1.905.

Multiply by Δz=1: total integral ≈1.905.

Multiply by (c/H0)=4.2857 Gpc: D_C≈4.2857 *1.905≈8.16 Gpc.

So approximately 8.16 Gpc. Looking at the options, the closest is option B)8 Gpc and D)7 Gpc.

But wait, I used the midpoint rule with a step of 1, which isn't very accurate. Perhaps a better approximation would give a value closer to 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc.

But wait, earlier when I considered the integral for z up to 5.5, I got a rough estimate of 9Gpc, but the midpoint approximation gives about 8.16 Gpc.

Hmm. Another way to approximate: the exact integral for z=5.5, using a calculator, would give D_C≈8.5 Gpc, but since the options are in whole numbers, perhaps 8 Gpc is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the lookback time or other factors.

Wait, another approach: the luminosity distance for z=5.5 is approximately 57 Gpc, because D_L = (1+z) * D_C. If D_C is 8 Gpc, D_L=6.5 *8=52 Gpc. If the actual D_L is higher, then D_C would be higher.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the scale of the universe. For the parameters given, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. The comoving distance for high z is roughly a few Gpc.

But I'm not sure. Given all the approximations, I think the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc, so the correct answer would be B)8 Gpc.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar's observed peak at 790 nm suggests significant redshift. Assuming the rest wavelength of the emission line is 121 nm (e.g., the Lyman-alpha line), the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength} - \text{rest wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} = \frac{790 - 121}{121} \approx 5.5
\]

With \( z \approx 5.5 \), we calculate the comoving distance \( D_C \) in a flat universe (\( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \)). The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
\]

Here, \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), and \( c/H_0 \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \). The integral is challenging to compute exactly but can be approximated by splitting it into regions where matter or dark energy dominates. For \( z \ll 1 \), dark energy contributes significantly, while for \( z \gg 1 \), matter dominates.

### Key Approximations:
1. **Matter-dominated region (\( z \gg 1 \)):**
   \[
   E(z) \approx \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3}, \quad \frac{1}{E(z)} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} (1+z)^{-3/2}
   \]
   The integral over this region is approximated as:
   \[
   \int_{z_{\text{matter}}}^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right]
   \]

2. **Dark energy-dominated region (\( z \ll 1 \)):**
   \[
   E(z) \approx \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}, \quad \frac{1}{E(z)} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}}
   \]
   The integral over this region is straightforward.

### Numerical Approximation:
The integral is split into two regions: \( 0 \leq z' \leq 1.3 \) (dark energy dominates) and \( 1.3 \leq z' \leq 5.5 \) (matter dominates). Using midpoint integration with a step size of \( \Delta z = 1 \), the integral is approximated as:

\[
\int_0^{5.5} \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \approx 1.905
\]

Multiplying by \( c/H_0 \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \), the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C \approx 4.2857 \times 1.905 \approx 8.16 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance is approximately \( 8.16 \, \text{Gpc} \), which aligns closely with option **B) 8 Gpc**. This value accounts for the redshift and the cosmological parameters provided.

Answer: B
