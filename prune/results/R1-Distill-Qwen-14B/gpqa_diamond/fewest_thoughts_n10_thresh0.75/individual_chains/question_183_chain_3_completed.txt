Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it again. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for some kind of addition reaction, maybe involving double bonds or something like that.

Wait, the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. I think red phosphorus is a mild reducing agent. Oh right, it's used to reduce carbonyl groups in the presence of HI. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the combination of red phosphorus and HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, right? Or maybe it's more about the deprotonation of acidic hydrogens.

Wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydration of alkynes to alkenes, but wait, no, that's another reaction. Alternatively, when you have a carbonyl group, red phosphorus and HI can perform a reduction. Oh wait, I think when you have a ketone or aldehyde, treating it with red phosphorus and HI converts the carbonyl group to a methylene group. Because, for example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but wait, no, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Wittig reaction, but that's when you have a triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide to form a ylide. So that's not it here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the compound given. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, cyclohexene ring. Position 3 is an ene (double bond from C3 to C4, I guess). At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the substituents are: at C2, a formyl; at C5, a vinyl (probably as a substituent on the ring). Also, the ring is a cyclohexene, so there's a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. So, what does that do? Oh, I think that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can deprotonate certain groups. Wait, maybe it's about the acid. The molecule has a carboxylic acid group. Carboxylic acids are strong acids but not as strong as mineral acids. So, perhaps in the presence of HI, the carboxylic acid would be deprotonated? But wait, HI is a strong acid, so maybe the more acidic hydrogens are attacked.

Wait, no. Wait, when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI, maybe it's possible that the acidic alpha hydrogens (if any) could be abstracted. But wait, the compound has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the ring. Formyl groups are electron-withdrawing, which would make the alpha hydrogens more acidic. But wait, the cyclohexene ring has substituents; so the alpha positions would be adjacent to those.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about adding HI to the double bonds. Oh, but wait, the initial molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (between C3 and C4) and another in the vinyl group (the substituent at C5). So, maybe the reaction is a dihydrogenation or addition across the double bonds.

Wait, but HI is a halogenating agent. Oh, but when you have excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a case of adding HI to the double bonds, leading to dihydroxy or dihalide compounds. Or maybe the reaction is a halogenation via an allylic mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has two double bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens, N is nitrogens. But in this case, the original compound has two double bonds, so the index is 2 (from the cyclohexene) plus one from the vinyl group, so total 3.

Wait, but the question is about the product after reaction. So, when the reaction occurs, how does it affect the number of double bonds?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds. So, each double bond would add HI, making single bonds. Let's say each double bond in the product would be gone, so each would decrease the index by one.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and excess HI: I think this is the condition for the hydration of alkynes to cis-alkenes, but perhaps not. Alternatively, it's a dihalogenation reaction.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the production of alkenes from alkynes. Wait, no. Alternatively, I think that when you have an alkyne, treating it with red phosphorus and HI converts it into an alkene via a two-step addition. For example, HC≡CH + P and HI → CH2=CH2. So, each alkyne would add two equivalents of HI and become an alkene, but that's about alkynes. But in our case, the starting material has two double bonds, not an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds. Let's think about that: each double bond can add HI in a 1,2 addition. So, each double bond (like cyclohexene) would become a dihalide. But wait, adding HI to a double bond would result in a vicinal dihalide. But with excess HI, maybe more reactions happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a cyclohexene with substituents, and the reaction is adding HI across the cyclohexene double bond, making a diastereomer, but that doesn't change the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Wait, but the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of pi bonds plus the number of rings. So, if the reaction converts some of the double bonds into single bonds, the index would decrease.

The original molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, contributing 1 to the index) and two double bonds (the cyclohexene's double bond, and the vinyl group's double bond). So total index is 2 (from the two double bonds) plus 1 (from the ring), but wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, so the ring already includes that. Let me calculate the original index.

The formula for index of hydrogen deficiency is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But perhaps it's easier to count the double bonds and rings.

The original structure: cyclohexene ring (so one ring, which counts as one hydrogen deficiency), and the substituents have a formyl group (no double bonds) and a vinyl group (another double bond). So total double bonds: 2 (the ring's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond).

Wait, no. The cyclohexene has a double bond, so that's one. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so another double bond. So total double bonds: 2. Plus the ring (which counts as one), so total index is 3.

Wait, no. Wait, rings and double bonds each count as one each. So, if the molecule has a ring and a double bond, that's two, and another double bond would make three. But the original molecule has a cyclohexene (so one ring and one double bond), but wait, no, wait: a cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring itself is a cyclic structure, which counts as one hydrogen deficiency. The double bond in the ring is part of the ring, so perhaps it's not an additional. Hmm, no, wait. The formula for hydrogen deficiency is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens.

Alternatively, each ring and each double bond (including triple bonds) contributes one to the index. So the original molecule has:

- a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, so +1)
- a double bond in the vinyl group (so +1)
- the cyclohexene's double bond is part of the ring, so that's already accounted for by the ring. Wait, no. The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring itself, without the double bond, would have one degree of unsaturation. The presence of a double bond within the ring adds another degree. So for a cyclohexene, the index is 2 (one from the ring, one from the double bond). But wait, no, because a cyclohexene (which is a cyclic alkene) has a double bond in the ring. So the ring contributes one, the double bond another, so the index is 2.

Wait, but wait. A cyclohexane ring (all single bonds) has an index of 1 (one ring). If it has a double bond in the ring (cyclohexene), that adds one more, making the index 2. So for the original molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:

- The cyclohexene ring contributes 2 (ring plus double bond)
- The vinyl group has a double bond, contributing another 1
- The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, contributing another 1.

Wait, no, the formyl group is a carbonyl, so that's another double bond. So that would be three double bonds, plus the ring (but wait, the ring's double bond is already accounted for in the cyclohexene index). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. The formula for the index is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's count the atoms:

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down: cyclohexene ring (6 carbons). The substituents are at C2 (formyl, CHO) and C5 (vinyl, CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-).

So the formula would be C6H8O2 (cyclohexene) plus the substituents. Wait, the formyl is CHO (1 C, 1 O), the vinyl is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-, which is 2 C's.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H8O2. Let me count:

Cyclohexene ring: 6 C.

Formyl group: 1 C, 1 O.

Vinyl group: 2 C.

Carboxylic acid group: COOH, so 2 O and 2 O from the COOH.

Wait, no, the COOH is at position 3? Or is it at another position? Wait, no, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3 of the cyclohexene ring.

So, the ring has six carbons. At C2: formyl (CHO), which is one C. At C5: vinyl (CH2=CH-), which is two C. And at C3: COOH, which is two O's but only one C (the COOH is attached to the ring).

So the total C: 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 C?

Wait, no. Wait, the formyl is CHO, which is one C attached to the ring. The vinyl is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-, which is two C's attached to the ring, but the substituent is a vinyl group, which is one substituent (CH2CH2- isn't right; perhaps the substituent is CH2CH2, but actually, it's CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the substituent is CH2CH2 with a double bond, but in terms of carbon count, it's two C's.

So the ring has 6 C's. The substituents: formyl (1 C), vinyl (2 C), and COOH (1 C). So total C's: 6 +1 + 2 +1 = 10.

Hydrogens: Let's see. The ring in cyclohexene has 8 H (since cyclohexene has 6 C's in a ring with one double bond, so the number of H is 6*2 - 2 (for the double bond) = 10? Wait, no. Wait, for a cycloalkene, the formula is CnH2n. For cyclohexene, n=6, so H=10. But in this case, substituents will reduce the H count.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. Let's imagine the cyclohexene (with double bond between C3 and C4). Then, at C2, a formyl group (CHO), which is one substituent. At C5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to C5). And the COOH group is at C3.

Wait, but how many H does that leave on the ring? Each substituent would replace an H. The ring has six C's, each with two H's in cyclohexane, but in cyclohexene, each C in the double bond has one H (since double bonds have two substituents).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the hydrogen count using the formula.

The formula for the molecule is C10H8O3? Because:

Ring: 6 C, 8 H (since cyclohexene has 10 H?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C9H8O3. Let's see: cyclohexene has 6 C, 10 H. But with substituents (formyl, vinyl, COOH), each group adds some H.

Wait, maybe I should not get stuck on that. Let's try the index of hydrogen deficiency. The product after reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-). So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2OH or CH2I something? Wait, no, wait. In the presence of HI and red phosphorus, I think the carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group. So CHO would become CH2 something.

Wait, the reaction is known as the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes, but that uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine) and heat. Alternatively, another reduction. Wait, I think that when carbonyl compounds are treated with red phosphorus and HI, they form a methyl group. For example, RCHO + P and HI → RCH2I. Or perhaps RCHO → RCH2OH, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the carboxylic acid group (COOH) is also reacting. Because COOH is acidic, perhaps it's deprotonated by HI, but HI is a strong acid, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, the COOH group might be converted into an acid chloride, but that's not likely with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds. So the cyclohexene ring's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond would each react with HI. But HI adds to double bonds in an acid-catalyzed manner, typically adding across the double bond, leading to a dihalide.

Wait, but adding HI across a double bond would add two H and two I, but that would not change the index of hydrogen deficiency (since each double bond becomes a single bond, so each would decrease the index by 1). So, initial index is 3 (from 2 double bonds and 1 ring), but if both double bonds are saturated, the index would decrease by 2, making it 1 (ring remaining).

But wait, the product would have both double bonds saturated, so the index would be (ring count) 1? Or is the ring still present?

Wait, the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. When the double bond is saturated, the ring remains, but becomes a cyclohexane. So the ring (one) would still contribute to the index. So the index would be 1 (from the ring) plus any remaining double bonds.

Wait, but if the vinyl group's double bond is also saturated, then no additional hydrogen deficiency from that.

So, the original index is 3 (ring + two double bonds). After reaction, if all double bonds are saturated, the index becomes 1 (just the ring).

But wait, what about the formyl group? If the formyl group is reduced, that would add a hydrogen and change the structure.

Wait, the formyl group (CHO) is adjacent to the ring. When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the CHO is converted into CH2OH, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be reduced to a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the product would have the formyl group converted to a methylene group. So, from CHO to CH2I? Or perhaps to CH2OH, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but more accurately, I think that when an aldehyde (RCHO) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde is converted to a methyl group. For example, RCHO → RCH2I. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution at the alpha position of the carbonyl. But this is getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, I can think about the overall process:

The starting material has:

- A cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond → index 2)
- A vinyl group (another double bond → index +1)
- A formyl group (another double bond → index +1)
So total index is 4.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount. Wait, the formula for the index is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Let me compute it for the starting material.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the formula is C9H8O3.

Wait, how?

Cyclohexene is C6H10.

But substituents: formyl (CHO) adds 1 C, 1 O.

Vinyl (CH2=CH-) adds 2 C.

Carboxylic acid (COOH) adds 2 O and 1 C.

So C: 6 +1 +2 +1 =10? Or wait, the COOH is already part of the cyclohexene ring. So perhaps the formula is C9H8O3.

Wait, let me think again.

The ring has 6 C.

Formyl group: 1 C.

Vinyl group: 2 C.

COOH group: but it's attached to the ring, so it's one C.

Wait, but the COOH is a carboxylic group, which is -COOH. So in the ring, it's a substituent at position 3, so that's one C.

So total C: 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) = 10.

But wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has two O's but one C. So the formula would be C10H? O's: formyl (1 O), vinyl (no O), COOH (2 O) → total O is 3.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting the formula wrong, but perhaps the exact H count is not essential right now. Let's proceed.

So the starting material's index is (2*10 +2 - H - X + N)/2. But without knowing H, X, N, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the rings and double bonds.

The starting material has:

- One ring (cyclohexene) → 1
- One double bond in the cyclohexene → 1
- One double bond in the vinyl group → 1
- One double bond in the formyl group → 1 (the carbonyl)

Wait, so that's four double bonds? No, the formyl is a carbonyl, so that's a double bond. So total index is rings (1) + double bonds (3) → 4? Or perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is part of the ring, so it's already accounted for by the ring.

Wait, no. The ring counts as one, and each double bond (including in substituents) counts as one. So in the starting material, we have:

- 1 ring → 1
- 1 double bond in cyclohexene → +1
- 1 double bond in vinyl group → +1
- 1 double bond in formyl group → +1
Total index: 4.

Hmm, but that seems high. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is a carbonyl (so a double bond) and the vinyl group another, plus the cyclohexene's double bond. So three double bonds, plus one ring, so index is 4.

But when the reaction happens, what changes? The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

So, red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced. How? I think that the CHO group would be converted into a CH2 group. So, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I? Or CH2OH? Or perhaps it's transformed into CH3.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol. But wait, with what reagents? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a situation where the aldehyde group is converted into a methylene group. For example, RCHO → RCH2I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formyl group may be deprotonated and then undergo some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the carboxylic acid. Maybe the COOH group is converted into something else. But HI is a strong acid, so perhaps it's not a base, so maybe it doesn't deprotonate the COOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds, converting each double bond into a single bond with addition of HI. So, each double bond in the starting material would be converted into a single bond, with H and I added.

So, the cyclohexene ring's double bond would become a single bond, turning into a cyclohexane ring. The vinyl group's double bond would become a single bond, turning into an ethyl group (CH2CH2I? Or CH2CH2 with substituents.

Wait, but adding HI across a double bond would result in a vicinal diiodide. For example, CH2=CH2 + 2 HI → CH2I-CH2I. But the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, attached to the ring.

So, the vinyl group would become CH2-I-CH2-I attached to the ring. Or perhaps each double bond adds two H and two I.

But wait, if each double bond adds two H and two I, each addition would saturate the double bond, reducing the index by one.

So the starting material has three double bonds (ring, vinyl, formyl), so index 3 plus ring (but wait, the ring's double bond is a part of the ring, so perhaps it's already included as the ring's index). Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an index of 3, and after reaction, all double bonds are saturated, so the product would have an index of 1 (only the ring remains).

Wait, but if the ring's double bond is saturated, then the ring becomes a cyclohexane (no double bond), so the index from the ring is gone. So, original index: 3 (assuming three double bonds, no rings), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the formyl group into a CH2 group, the vinyl group into a CH2CH3 group (by adding HI across the double bond), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also saturated by adding HI, turning the ring into a cyclohexane.

So, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so no index from that)
- The formyl group converted into CH2 (no double bond)
- The vinyl group converted into CH2CH3 (no double bond)
So, the product would have no double bonds and no rings, so index 0.

But that would mean the product is fully saturated, which would have an index of 0. But looking at the options, option D is 0.

Wait, but the product would have a COOH group converted into what? Or is the COOH group unchanged?

Wait, the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. The COOH group is a strong acid, but in the presence of HI (which is a stronger acid), perhaps it's not involved in the reaction. So the COOH group remains as is.

But wait, if the formyl group is reduced, perhaps the COOH group is not directly involved. Alternatively, maybe the formyl is transformed.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) is adjacent to the cyclohexene ring. So, perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bond in the vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring, and reducing the formyl group.

So, the vinyl group's double bond is saturated, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, and the formyl group is reduced to a CH2 group.

So, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so no index from that)
- A CH2 group where the formyl was
- An ethyl group where the vinyl was
- The COOH group remains.

So, the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so the index is 0.

Wait, but the ring was a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, if the double bond is saturated, the ring becomes a cyclohexane, which is a single ring with no double bonds. So, the index would be 1 (from the ring) because the ring contributes one.

But wait, the product's index would then be 1, but what about any double bonds in substituents?

Wait, if all double bonds are saturated (including the vinyl group's), then the product has no double bonds and a single ring, so index is 1.

But wait, let me recount: the product has a cyclohexane ring (so one ring → index +1), and no double bonds → so index is 1. 

But looking at the options, option A is 1. So, the answer would be A) 1.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond. Let me think again.

If the reaction adds HI to the vinyl group but not to the cyclohexene ring, then the ring's double bond remains, leading to an index of 2 (ring + formyl group's double bond, if any), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a methylene group, which doesn't have a double bond, and the vinyl group's double bond is saturated, and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated.

In that case, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring → index 1 (from the ring)
- No double bonds → so index 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to a CH2 group, which doesn't contribute to the index.

Wait, the initial index is 3 (ring + two double bonds). After reaction, the ring's double bond is saturated (so index from that is removed, but ring remains), and the vinyl and formyl double bonds are gone. So the index would be 1 (from the ring).

So, the answer would be A) 1.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - A cyclohexene ring (a six-membered ring with one double bond).
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
     - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5.
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 3.
   - The **index of hydrogen deficiency** for the starting material is:
     - 1 (from the cyclohexene ring) + 1 (from the vinyl group's double bond) + 1 (from the formyl group's carbonyl double bond) = **3**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. They reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes) to methylene groups (-CH₂-) and can also add across double bonds, converting them into single bonds.
   - The reaction affects the molecule as follows:
     - The **formyl group (CHO)** is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), eliminating its double bond.
     - The **vinyl group's double bond (CH₂=CH-)** is saturated, converting it into an ethyl group (CH₂-CH₃).
     - The **cyclohexene ring's double bond** is also saturated, converting the ring into a cyclohexane ring.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The product contains:
     - A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, but still contributes 1 to the index due to the ring).
     - A methylene group (-CH₂-) where the formyl group was.
     - An ethyl group (CH₂-CH₃) where the vinyl group was.
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unchanged.
   - The product has no double bonds and retains the cyclohexane ring.

4. **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**:
   - The product has:
     - 1 (from the cyclohexane ring).
     - No double bonds.
   - Therefore, the **index of hydrogen deficiency** of the product is **1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**. 

ANSWER: A
