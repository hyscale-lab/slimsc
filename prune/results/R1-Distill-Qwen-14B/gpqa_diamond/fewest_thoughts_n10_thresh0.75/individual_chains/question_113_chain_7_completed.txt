Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using several spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options provided are possible chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness is often due to hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or carboxylic acids. However, carboxylic acids typically have a very strong and broad peak around 2500-3300, but sometimes the peak can be around 3000. Another possibility is an alcohol, which also has a broad O-H stretch.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a ketone or maybe an ester, or perhaps an amide, but there's no mention of N here, so probably not an amide. Wait, but 1650 could also be due to a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C). Hmm, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so maybe there's a double bond.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, that's also around 1700. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl with some conjugation, like in an ester (maybe the ester carbonyl is around 1700, and another peak for something else? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a carbonyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Let me think about the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So the compound probably has a double bond or an aromatic ring. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1650, which is a bit lower than a typical alkene's C=C stretch, which is usually around 1640-1680. So maybe that's the C=C in a conjugated system.

So putting that together, maybe the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, like an ester. Because esters have two carbonyls? No, wait, esters have one carbonyl, maybe around 1700. Hmm, maybe the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, like an alkene.

Wait, or perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring, but the NMR has vinyl H's, so maybe the compound is something like an aromatic ester. Or maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone? Or perhaps it's a ketone with a double bond.

Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, say, an ester, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would make sense because the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl, which would lower the wavenumber a bit.

So, considering that, the compound might be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Or perhaps an aromatic ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Now, moving on to the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data. The fragment peak is at m/z=45. So, what fragments give m/z=45?

Well, 45 is the molecular weight of several small ions. For example, the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something, but wait, 45 is more likely to be a common ion like (CH3)2O (which is 45 g/mol: 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(15) = 30? No, wait, (CH3)2O is (2*15) + (16) = 30 +16=46. Hmm, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CO, but that's 59. Hmm. Let's think of other possibilities. 

Another common fragment is the CH2CO group, which would be 43 if I'm not mistaken. Or maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group with some substituents. Wait, 45 could be a propyl group (C3H7), but that would be 43 (3*12 +7=43). Hmm. Alternatively, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, that's 91. No, perhaps it's the ethyl group with some oxygen? Hmm, let's think about common fragments. Another thing is, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group plus something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into a smaller ion, like a CH2O group. Wait, the molecular weight of CH2O is 30 (12+2+16=30). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group. Let me think: the fragment could be an aldehyde group (CHO) which is 29. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketone group, but that's not going to give 45. Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COH, which is 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see what their possible fragments could be. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, the molecular formulas are varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. Let's see:

- C6H12O: 6 carbons, 12 H, 1 O. The molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(16)=72+12+16=100.

- C6H10O: 6*12=72, 10 H is 10, O is 16. Total 72+10+16=98.

- C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2 O=32. 72+10+32=114.

- C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12 H=12, 32 O. 72+12+32=116.

So the possible molecular weights are 100, 98, 114, 116. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's see what each molecular formula can lose to give a fragment of 45.

Wait, perhaps the molecular ion (M+) breaks into two parts. For instance, if the molecule loses a fragment of (M - 45), then the rest would be 45. Alternatively, the fragment might be a cleaved part of the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for what structures with these formulas could produce a fragment of 45. Let's think about possible structures.

The FTIR indicates possible O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl group. The NMR has vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a 45 m/z fragment.

So, let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester, like methyl something, or perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone), or a diol with a carbonyl group.

Option B: C6H10O. Maybe an aromatic compound, but with only one O. Could be an alcohol with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Or a ketone with an ester group? Or maybe a lactone, but with another oxygen.

Option D: C6H12O. Could be an alcohol with some double bonds or a carbonyl group, but not sure.

But the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an O-H. So likely an alcohol (if it's in the 3000 cm⁻¹ range and broad). If the compound is an ester, the O-H might not be present. Wait, but if it's an ester, then where is the O-H? Unless it's another group. Wait, no, in an ester, there's no O-H. So if the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, that would suggest an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but their IR also has a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then why the NMR shows vinyl H's? Carboxylic acids can have double bonds elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl group. So maybe an allylic alcohol or something similar.

Wait, but another thought: the fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about the possible structures that can break down into a 45 fragment. Let me think about what 45 could represent.

45 could be (CH3)3COH, but wait, (CH3)3COH is 45? Let's calculate: (3*CH3) is 3*(15)=45, but that's not including O. Wait, (CH3)3COH would be (3*15) + (15) + 16 + 1? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, 45 is (CH3)CO- something. Wait, (CH3)CO is 43 (12+16 + (3*1))? Maybe not.

Alternatively, 45 could be CH2COOH, but that's 2*(12) + 2 + 2*(16) +1= 24 + 2 +32 +1=59. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene group? Or maybe it's a fragment from an ester. For example, an ester group might lose a part. Let's think about an ester. The ester functional group is OCOOR. If the molecule breaks after the carbonyl oxygen, maybe it forms a fragment of OCOOR, but I'm not sure how that would give m/z=45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of each option. Let's see what each option could lose to give a 45 fragment.

Option A: C6H12O2. Suppose the molecular weight is 116. If it loses a fragment of 71 (116-45=71), what would 71 be? 71 is close to the molecular weight of something like CH2=CHCOOH (which is 72, but maybe not exact). Alternatively, perhaps it's a part of the structure.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight 98. If it loses 53 (98-45=53), what's 53? That's the molecular weight of something like CH2=CHCH2OH (which is 16 (CH2OH) + 28 (CH2CH2?), no, wait, perhaps another structure. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If it loses 69 (114-45=69), what is 69? 69 could be (CH3)2CH2O, but wait, (CH2CH2CH3)O is (3*12 + 8) = 44, which is not 69. Hmm, 69 is maybe a benzene ring fragment? Like C6H5 group is 77, which is too big. Alternatively, the fragment could be C4H8O (which is (4*12)+(8)+(16)=48+16=64), not 69.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an ester group. For example, in an ester, when it breaks, perhaps the ester could split into the acid and the alcohol part. Suppose the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not right. Wait, no, an ester is RCOOR', so maybe when it breaks, it could form RCOO+ and R' as a separate ion. The RCOO+ group would have a molecular weight of (R's molecular weight + 60, since COO- is 60). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the ester's acyl group. For example, the ester RCOOR' would lose the R' group, leaving RCOO+, which would have a molecular weight of (12n +2 +16*2). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, going back to the mass spec data. The fragment is at m/z=45. So perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COO- (which would be 59, not 45). Or maybe it's a CH2CO group, which is 43. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2O, which is 44 ( (2*12) + (4*1) + 16= 24 +4 +16=44 ). Close to 45, but not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is (CH3)COH, which is 45. Let me calculate: (12+3) for CH3 (15), plus C (12), plus O (16), plus H (1). Wait, (CH3)COH would be C2H5O, but wait, (CH3)COH is actually CH3COH, which is propanal? No, wait, CH3COH is propan-2-ol. No, wait, propan-2-ol is (CH3)2CHOH. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, (CH3)COH is 45. Let me compute: molecular formula is C2H5O, but wait, (CH3)COH is C2H5O, which is 2*12 +5*1 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! So the fragment could be (CH3)COH, which is propan-2-ol. So that would have a molecular weight of 45. So if the parent ion loses some group, leaving (CH3)COH as a fragment, then the parent must have that group attached.

So if the parent compound has a (CH3)COH group, then the fragment would be m/z=45. So what's the structure of the parent compound that includes (CH3)COH?

Alternatively, the fragment could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. That's (12*3)+(6)=42. No, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a vinyl group attached to something. For example, CH2=CH-O- would have a molecular weight of (2*12) + (4*1) + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44. Close to 45, but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possible structures that match the IR, NMR, and MS data.

The IR has O-H (alcohol) and a carbonyl. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So the structure could be an allylic alcohol, perhaps. An allylic alcohol is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond.

For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2OH. But that would have a molecular formula of C4H8O. Wait, but the options are C6. So maybe it's a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but cyclic esters are lactones, which don't have O-H groups because the ester is formed by an intramolecular esterification. So a lactone would not have an O-H stretch, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the presence of both O-H (from the IR) and a carbonyl group suggests perhaps a ketone or an ester along with an alcohol. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, ether, or a compound with both an ester and an alcohol. But an ester wouldn't have an O-H.

Wait, but if the compound is a diol and an ester? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal, but that's less likely.

Option D: C6H12O. Could be an alcohol with a carbonyl group elsewhere. Let's say a cyclohexanol with a ketone group, but that would require the molecular formula to have two O's. No, because Option D is C6H12O. So only one O. So if the structure has an O-H (alcohol) and a carbonyl, that would require two O's. So Option D can't have both an O-H and a carbonyl, because it only has one O. So the IR shows two strong absorption peaks, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 (O-H) and two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (possibly carbonyls). So two carbonyl peaks. So that would require two oxygen atoms. So options with only one O can be eliminated. Let me check:

Options with one O: B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).

So if the compound has two O's (as suggested by the IR), then the options with two O's are A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2).

So that eliminates B and D as possibilities. Because if there are two O's in the molecule (from the two carbonyl groups), then the formula must have at least two O's.

Wait, but the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps it's an ester (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650)? Or maybe a ketone and another group. Or perhaps it's an ester and a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester (which has one O in the ester group), but perhaps there's another carbonyl group, like a ketone. But that would require another O. So the formula would need two O's, which is in options A and C.

So that leaves options A and C.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl H's, so there's a double bond in the structure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Which of options A and C can produce a fragment of 45?

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's think about possible structures. For example, an ester with a double bond. Like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-carboxylate. Alternatively, perhaps something like methyl vinyl something. Or maybe a diester? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the molecular formula of each option. For option A, C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. Since the NMR has vinyl H's, it's a double bond. So one degree of unsaturation is a double bond, the other could be a ring.

Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So DoU is 1. Which could be a double bond or a ring.

But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have a double bond and no rings (since DoU is 1). So it's an open-chain compound with a double bond and two oxygen atoms.

Wait, but if the DoU is 1, that's either a double bond or a ring. Since it's a double bond, that's 1 DoU.

So for option A, C6H12O2: possible structures include an ester with a double bond. For example, an ester like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). Let's check the molecular formula: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is C4H6O2. But our option is C6H12O2. Hmm, so perhaps a larger ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the structure could be a diol diester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec fragment. If the structure is an ester with a double bond, the fragment at 45 could come from the ester portion. Let's say the ester is something like RCOOR'. If the molecule breaks between the carbonyl and the oxygen, then the RCOO group would have a molecular weight of RCOO+. Let's suppose R is (CH2)n.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)COH, which is 45 as we determined earlier. So if the compound includes a (CH3)COH group, then the fragment would be 45.

So if the parent compound is something like (CH3)COH attached to another group, perhaps an ester.

Wait, but (CH3)COH is CH3COH, which is propan-2-ol. Hmm, but how does that fit into the structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Like CH2(COOR)COH. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO), which has a molecular weight of 43. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2COO), which is 58 (but that's higher than 45). Not matching.

Wait, maybe the parent molecule is something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). Let's see the molecular formula: C4H6O2. But our options are C6H12O2 and C6H10O2.

So perhaps the compound is a di-substituted ester with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But then, the O would be part of the ring, and the other O in the ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, the structure could be an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOO-R.

But I'm not getting much from this. Let me think about the other option, which is option C: C6H10O2.

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings.

But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so at least one double bond. So the other could be a ring, or another double bond.

So, possible structures could be an ester with a double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) and perhaps a ring.

Hmm, but how does that tie into the mass spec?

If the fragment is 45, and the molecular formula is C6H10O2, perhaps the compound is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that's C4H6O. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a six-membered ring and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diester with a conjugated double bond. For example, something like diethyl maleate, but that would have more carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl H's, which are usually deshielded and appear downfield. The presence of a double bond also affects the IR, perhaps causing the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak.

Let me think about the possible esters. An ester with a conjugated double bond would have the carbonyl absorption around 1700 and the conjugated C=C around 1650. That would match the IR data.

So an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have this. The structure would be something like RCO-O-R', where R has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

In such a case, the ester group would be conjugated with the double bond, which would lower the carbonyl absorption to around 1700 and the C=C around 1650.

Then, the NMR would show the vinyl H's, which would be split based on their environment.

Now, the mass spec. If the parent compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, perhaps the fragment at 45 comes from the loss of the ester group or some part of it.

Wait, but the fragment at 45 is a m/z, which is the mass-to-charge ratio. So it's a fragment ion. For example, a common fragment in esters is the acylium ion, RCO⁺, which would have a mass equal to the acyl group's molecular weight plus the charge.

So, if the acyl group is (CH2) something, let's see: if the fragment is CH2CO, that's 44. But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Wait, another common fragment is (CH3)CO⁺, which is 43. Close, but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the methyl group attached to the ester. For example, in methyl acrylate, the fragment (CH3O) would be 31, but that's not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ester's R group. For example, if the ester is RCOOCH2CH2..., then the loss of RCOO might leave the CH2CH2 group, but that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acyl group itself. For example, if the acyl group is (CH2)2CO, which would be 58. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the parent compound is a cyclic ester with a substituent that can fragment into 45. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the parent is a diester, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option A is C6H12O2. That's molecular weight 116. If the fragment is 45, the other part would be 116-45=71. But I don't know what 71 is. Let's see: 71 is the molecular weight of something like C5H11O (which is 5*12 +11 +16=60 +11+16=87? No, that's not right. Wait, 71=12*5 + 11 - no, that's 60 +11=71. So 71 would be C5H11O. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 114. 114-45=69. What is 69? 69 could be C4H9O (4*12=48 +9 +16=73? No, 48+9+16=73. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps 69 is C3H7O2? No, that's 3*12 +14 +32= 36+14+32=82. Not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what 45 could be in terms of possible functional groups. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)COH (propan-2-ol), as I thought earlier.

So, if the parent compound is an ester that includes a (CH3)COH group, then it would fragment into that.

Wait, but (CH3)COH is an alcohol, and an ester would have OCOOR. So perhaps the parent is something like (CH3)COCH2CH2OOCR. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the parent is a ketone with an ester group. Hmm, but that would complicate things.

Wait, maybe the parent is an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's C7H12O2, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going about this wrong. Let's look at the options again.

We have to choose between A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) because options B and D have only one O, which doesn't fit the IR data.

Now, the presence of a fragment at 45 suggests that the parent has a group that can break off to form 45.

Option A: C6H12O2.

If the molecular weight is 116 and it loses 45, the remaining is 71. But what's 71? 71 is the molecular weight of C5H11O. But that's not a standard fragment I can think of. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks in a way that 45 is a part of it.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. What's 69? 69 is the molecular weight of C4H9O2? Wait, 4*12=48, 9=9, 2*16=32. So 48+9+32= 89. No, that's higher. Alternatively, C3H7O2:3*12=36,7=7,32=32. 36+7+32=75. Hmm, not 69.

Wait, another possibility: 69 is the molecular weight of a benzyl group (C6H5CH2+). But that's 77 (C7H7+). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, 69 could be the molecular weight of a cyclopropane ring with some substituents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 69 could be a fragment from a larger molecule, like (CH2)2CHCOO- but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a COOCH3 group. COOCH3 has a molecular weight of 15 (COO is 44, plus CH3 is 15: 44+15=59. No, that's higher than 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the parent compound is a methyl ester. Let's say the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's C7H12O2, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclopropane with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the presence of vinyl H's in the NMR suggests a double bond. So, in the structure, there must be a double bond. So perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which has a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl.

The structure would be RCO-O-R', where R has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R'.

In that case, the IR would show the C=O at ~1700 cm⁻¹ and the conjugated C=C at ~1650 cm⁻¹, which matches the data.

So, for such a structure, the possible molecular formula would have to fit into C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, that's C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and the ester would be attached to a C3H7 group. So total would be C6H11O2. Hmm, no, wait:

Wait, CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2. If it's esterified with, say, methyl group (OCH3), then the formula would be C4H6O2. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps a better example: for option C, C6H10O2.

An example structure would be methyl vinyl ketone, but that's C4H6O. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, the formula for that would be:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH2CH3 is C4H9. So the total is C3 + C4 = C7, which is too big. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's longer than our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond and has the formula C6H10O2, then the degree of unsaturation is 2 (as calculated earlier). So, one from the double bond and another from the ester ring (since esters are cyclic when they're lactones). Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Let me think about the mass spec again. If the parent is C6H10O2 and the fragment is 45, perhaps the parent breaks into two parts: 45 and 69. 69 is not a familiar fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the methyl group (45 is higher than the methyl group's mass).

Wait, another thought: the m/z=45 could be the tropylium ion. The tropylium ion is C7H7+ with a mass of 91. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the result of the ester group cleaving. For example, in an ester RCOOR', the RCOO+ group would have a mass of (R's molecular weight + 44). But 44 is COO, so the R would be a group with mass 1. So R would be CH3, making RCOO+ = (15 + 44)=59. Not matching 45.

Alternatively, if R is CH2, then RCOO+ would be (14 +44)=58. Still not 45.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another angle.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are typically split into a doublet or a triplet, depending on the neighboring groups. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps in a trans or cis configuration.

The IR has O-H (broad peak), so the compound must have an -OH group. So, the structure must have both an -OH and a carbonyl group. So that suggests either a carboxylic acid (but that would have a broad O-H and a strong carbonyl peak) or an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone.

Wait, but an ester doesn't have an O-H group. So, if the structure has both an O-H and a carbonyl, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would require two O's, which is acceptable in options A and C.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a beta-hydroxy ester. For example, R-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-R'. Would that fit? Let's see.

But in that case, the ester would have an O-H group from the alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol diester, but that's getting complicated.

Another thought: The IR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a strong hydrogen bonding, such as in a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond.

But then, the molecular formula would need to have two O's: one for the -COOH group and another for the double bond? No, the -COOH has two O's in the group. Wait, the formula would be C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be RCOOH, where R has a double bond.

The NMR would show vinyl H's, so R has a double bond. The IR would show the broad O-H of the carboxylic acid and the carbonyl around 1700.

So, for example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Let's calculate the formula. That would be C7H10O2. But our options are up to C6, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter chain. Like CH2=CHCOOH. That's C3H4O2. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic carboxylic acid with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a di-carboxylic acid, but that would require more O's than the options.

So, perhaps the initial assumption that the broad peak is from an O-H is correct, but the structure isn't a carboxylic acid. Maybe it's an alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the options don't include benzene rings. Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl alcohol, which has an O-H and a double bond.

But without a benzene ring, it's difficult to match the molecular formulas.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structures for each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, cyclic esters (lactones), or perhaps a ketone with an alcohol.

But an ester would have the formula RCOOR', which uses two O's. The IR would show the ester carbonyl, but no O-H, unless it's a hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether with a carbonyl group. But ethers don't have O-H.

So, if the structure has an O-H and a carbonyl, it can't be an ester. It must be something else. Wait, perhaps it's a glycol ester, but that's more complex.

Wait, another thought: the structure could be an acetylated alcohol. For example, an alcohol with an acetyl group attached. Like R-O-CO-CH2CH3. But that would make the formula more complicated.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about the MS data again. Maybe the fragment at 45 is a CH3CO group (43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2CO group, which is 58.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2OH group. That's 33. No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the parent compound is a cyclic hemiacetal, but I don't know enough about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a COOCH3 group. COOCH3 is 59, which doesn't match.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's think about the molecular formula of the fragment, which is 45. It must have a molecular formula that adds up to 45. Possible formulas could be C3H7O (45 = (3*12) +7 +16=36+7+16=60?), no. Wait, 3*12 is 36, plus 7 (H) is 43, plus O is 16, total is 60. No, that's too high.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is C2H5O2. 2*12=24, 5 H=5, 2 O=32. 24+5+32=61. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is C4H8O. 4*12=48, 8=8, 16=16. Total 72. No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a COOCH2CH3 group. COOCH2CH3 is 44 +15=59. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O- group. That's (12*2) + (4) + 16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45, but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-OH. That's 45: (12*2)=24, (2*1)=2, O=16, H=1 (from OH). Wait, CH2=CH-OH is propene-1-ol. The molecular formula is C2H5O, which is 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Yes! So the fragment is CH2=CH-OH.

So, if the parent compound is something that can lose this fragment, then the parent would have a CH2=CH-OH group attached.

So, the parent would have a molecular formula that includes C2H5O as a part, plus the rest.

Looking at the options, the parent must be either C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C).

So, the parent would have the CH2=CH-OH group plus another part.

For option A: C6H12O2. If the parent is CH2=CH-OH plus another group that has 4 carbons, 10 H, and 1 O (because 2 O's in total).

Wait, CH2=CH-OH is C2H5O. So the remaining part would be C4H7O. Hmm, but that's not possible because C4H7O has a molecular formula that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is (CH2=CH-OH)-COOR. Let's see. So, if the parent is (CH2=CH-OH)-COOCH3, that would be C5H8O3, which is not an option.

Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the parent is (CH2=CH-OH) attached to an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is a diol diester with a double bond. But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, but the fragment is CH2=CH-OH (45), so the parent must have this group. So, the parent would be (CH2=CH-OH) attached to another group.

If the parent is (CH2=CH-OH)-COOR, where R is an alkyl group. Then, the molecular formula would be C2H5O (from CH2=CH-OH) plus COOR.

For example, if R is CH2CH2CH3 (propane), then COOR would be COOCH2CH2CH3, which is C4H8O2. So the total would be C2 + C4 = C6. H: 5 (from CH2=CH-OH) + 8 (from COOCH2CH2CH3) =13 H. O: 1 (from OH) +2 (from COO) =3 O. But the options only have two O's. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Let me try to think differently.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the information.

The FTIR shows O-H (alcohol) and two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group.

Wait, 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C. So perhaps the compound has one carbonyl and one conjugated double bond.

The presence of vinyl H's in the NMR indicates a double bond.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which could be (CH3)COH (propan-2-ol), which has a molecular weight of 45.

If the parent compound is an ester that includes a (CH3)COH group, perhaps as a substituent, then the ester would have a fragment that breaks off as (CH3)COH.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is a beta-keto ester, which has the structure RC(O)CH2COOR'. But that would require a specific structure.

Wait, beta-keto esters have the structure RCOCH2COOR'. The IR would show two carbonyl peaks: one from the ketone (around 1700) and one from the ester (around 1750?), but our IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, considering all this, the most likely structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a conjugated double bond. This would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The ester group would also explain the carbonyl.

Then, the presence of vinyl H's in the NMR makes sense because of the double bond.

As for the mass spec, if the ester group breaks off, the fragment could be the acyl part. For example, the acyl group is (CH2)COO, which has a molecular weight of (12*2 +1*4 +16*2)=24 +4 +32=60. But that's higher than 45.

Hmm. I'm not getting closer. Another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2 is C2H4. So total is C5H8O2, which is less than our option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. Let's say the ester is part of a five-membered ring. For example, cyclopentene ester. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's speculative.

Given the time I've spent and the information, I think I'll have to make a choice between options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation is 1. So it's either a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR shows a double bond, that's accounted for. But wait, what kind of structure would that be?

Wait, if the structure is an ester with a double bond, then the formula is C6H12O2. Esters are RCOOR', so let's say R is C3H5 and R' is C3H7. Then RCOOR' is C6H12O2. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH3. No, wait, that would be C5H10O2, which is less than C6.

Alternatively, R is C4H7 and R' is C2H5. Then RCOOR' would be C6H12O2. So the structure could be, say, CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H12O2.

In this case, the ester's IR peak would be around 1700, and the C=C would be around 1650. The NMR would show vinyl H's (from the CH2=CH part). The mass spec might fragment to lose the ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the fragment at 45 could be the acyl group: CH2=CHCH2CH2COO would have a molecular weight of (5*12) + ... Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, which is 46 (C2H5). No, that's 46, not 45.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the IR and NMR data, the most likely structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a conjugated double bond, which would fit the O-H, carbonyl, and vinyl H's. The mass spec fragment of 45 suggests the presence of a (CH3)COH group.

But I'm not entirely certain. Given that, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Two strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** suggest the presence of a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a fragment such as **(CH₃)COH** (propan-2-ol), which has a molecular weight of 45.

### Molecular Formula Options:
The options provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Elimination of Options:
1. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)** and **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)** are eliminated because they contain only one oxygen atom. The FTIR data indicates the presence of two functional groups requiring at least two oxygen atoms (e.g., a carbonyl and an O-H group).

2. This leaves **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)** and **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)** as the remaining possibilities.

#### Degree of Unsaturation:
- For **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 12 - 0)}{2} = 1$.  
  This suggests either one double bond or one ring.

- For **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 10 - 0)}{2} = 2$.  
  This suggests two double bonds, one double bond and one ring, or two rings.

#### Structure Considerations:
- The FTIR data suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C), which aligns with **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**, as it allows for two degrees of unsaturation (e.g., one carbonyl and one conjugated double bond).
- The ¹H NMR data confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, further supporting the presence of a double bond.

#### Mass Spectrometry Fragment:
- The fragment at **m/z = 45** could correspond to a fragment such as **(CH₃)COH** (propan-2-ol), which is consistent with **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)** if the parent compound includes a (CH₃)COH group as part of its structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the most likely molecular formula for the unknown compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
