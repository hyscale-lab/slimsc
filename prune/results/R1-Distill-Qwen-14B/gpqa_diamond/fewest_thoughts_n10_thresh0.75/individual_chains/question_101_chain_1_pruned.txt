Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, and the final product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the given options.

First, I'll try to understand the reaction. So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? 3-methyl means there's a methyl group on the third carbon of the pyrrolidine ring.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond (the 'idene' part) attached to a methyl group. So, the product has a substituent on the pyrrolidine that's a cyclohexylidene methyl group.

Wait, so looking at the product structure, it seems like the methyl group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1. That methyl is connected to a cyclohexylene (a cyclohexane ring with a double bond). So the structure is like the pyrrolidine ring with a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

I think this is a case of a ring expansion or some kind of alkylation. Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 of the pyrrolidine. So, the starting material already has a methyl at position 3, and now there's a new substituent at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by a ring-forming? Or maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition.

The reaction is acid-catalyzed, so probably some kind of acid-catalyzed mechanism, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, or perhaps an aldol addition, or maybe a ring-opening via a carbocation.
