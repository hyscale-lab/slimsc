Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves reactions of alkenes with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide.

The question says that the chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and both go to 100% completion.

Wait, so both reactions are epoxidations followed by something else. Oh wait, after epoxidation, what happens when treated with aqueous acid? Oh right! Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions. The mechanism usually involves the acid protonating the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the ring opens with water or another nucleophile attacking.

Wait, but the question says both reactions go to completion, so maybe the acid workup is just part of the reaction. Let me think. So, the initial step is epoxidation, converting the alkene to an epoxide. Then, under aqueous acid conditions, the epoxide might undergo ring-opening. But wait, what's the structure after that?

Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetrical molecule in the case of the (Z) isomer? No, wait, oct-4-ene is a eight-carbon chain with a double bond between C4 and C5. The (E) and (Z) configurations would affect the structure of the epoxide.

First, reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. The (E) configuration means that the higher priority groups are opposite each other. So for oct-4-ene, each end of the double bond is CH2CH2 or CH2CH3? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both sides? Let me think, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on each end of the double bond. Or wait, more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2
