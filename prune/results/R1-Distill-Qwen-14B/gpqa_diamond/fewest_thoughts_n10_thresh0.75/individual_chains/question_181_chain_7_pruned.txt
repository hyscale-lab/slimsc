Okay, I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Let me think through this step by step. So, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. I remember that the pp chain is responsible for a lot of the Sun's energy, especially in the core.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain that produces helium. The pp-I branch is the initial step where two protons fuse into deuterium, right? Then, I think the pp-II branch involves capturing a proton to form tritium, and pp-III is when that tritium emits a positron and becomes helium-3. So, if the pp-III branch stops, then that part of the chain would no longer contribute to the neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the beta decay steps of the pp and CNO cycles. In the pp chain, the dominant neutrino source is the decay of boron-8 into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. But wait, that's the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch would be the decay of helium-3 into helium-4, producing a neutrino as well. So, when the pp-III branch stops, those neutrinos from that decay would stop coming.

Hmm, but wait. If pp-III stops, what about the other parts of the chain? Like, would the earlier steps still proceed? The question says all other reactions remain as they were. So, the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, but pp-III is not.

So, the neutrino production from the pp chain would be affected. The neutrinos emitted from the pp-III branch are a significant part of the solar neutrino flux. If that stops, the overall flux from the pp chain would decrease.

But the question is about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux in each band changes when pp-III stops.

I remember that the neutrinos from the different branches have different energies. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos around several MeV, but wait, more specifically, the neutrinos from the decay of B-8 are about 15-17 MeV, right? Wait no
