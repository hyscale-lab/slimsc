Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain part of the solar reactions stops. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The pp chain is one of the main ways, especially in the core. Oh right, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Each produces different elements, and importantly, different neutrinos.

In the pp-III branch, I think it's the branch where you have reactions involving boron. So, like, you start with protons (hydrogen nuclei) fusing, and one of the steps produces boron-8, which then decays into beryllium-8 and emits a positron. And I remember that in the pp-III branch, the main neutrino emission comes from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium and a neutrino. Or wait, maybe it's the decay of Be-8 into two He-4 nuclei, but that's probably not where the neutrinos come from.

Wait, the key part is that neutrinos are produced in the Sun, and their flux depends on the reactions happening. The standard solar neutrinos come mainly from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch, I think, which produces a helium-4 nucleus and emits a positron and a neutrino. Or wait,
