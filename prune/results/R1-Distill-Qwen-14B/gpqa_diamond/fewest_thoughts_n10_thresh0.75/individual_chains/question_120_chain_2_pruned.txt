Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. Let me think. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means the same number of stars in each volume of space, right? So, the density is uniform.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax p (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance d (in parsecs), so p = 1/d. Oh right, so as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, imagine I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume itself. But wait, how does the volume relate to the parallax?

Let's think in terms of spherical shells. For a given distance (d), the volume of a thin shell at that distance is 4πd² dd, right? Because the surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dd (the small change in distance). But since parallax p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So, substituting d in terms of p, I can write the volume in terms of p.

So, d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. Wait, maybe I should express the volume in terms of p. Let me see.

The volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² dd. Because for each shell at distance d, the volume is surface area times thickness. So, in terms of parallax, since d = 1/p, substituting:

Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But dd is the change in distance. We need to express dd in terms of change in parallax, dp. Because we're considering a range of p, say from p to p + dp.

So, p = 1/d → d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but since we're considering a range, maybe the magnitude is what matters here. So, |dd| = (1/p²) dp.
