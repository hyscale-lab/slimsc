Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right! The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So, a star that's farther away has a smaller parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, meaning their distances are spread out evenly in space. Wait, no, wait. Uniformly distributed in what way? I think it refers to the density of stars being uniform in space. So, the same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere.

So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. But we're looking at how the number per unit parallax range changes with plx. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as plx increases, the stars are closer, and as plx decreases, they are farther away.

I think I need to find the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx. Since the parallax decreases with distance, each shell corresponds to a certain distance range. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, and the shell is the difference between r and r+dr, which approximates to 4πr² dr when dr is small.

So, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Let's say the number density is n
