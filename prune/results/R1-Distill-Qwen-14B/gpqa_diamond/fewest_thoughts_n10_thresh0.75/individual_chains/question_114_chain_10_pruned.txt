Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, right? So in a ketone, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Oh wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one has the structure CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. When a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-), it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would be the addition of CN and OH across the carbonyl group. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure:

The product structure is CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3, but wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the OH and CN on the same carbon. Let me count: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the hydroxy and methyl are on the second
