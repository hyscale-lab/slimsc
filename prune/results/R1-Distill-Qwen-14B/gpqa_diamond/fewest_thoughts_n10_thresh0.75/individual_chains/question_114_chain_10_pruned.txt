Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for each step. Let me think this through step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So if you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, what reaction happens?

Oh right! I think this is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or its equivalent. But here, it's NaCN, which might be acting in a similar way. Wait, but CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon in a nucleophilic addition. So the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, forming a new carbon-cyanide bond. Then, since it's a ketone, the product would have two R groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would make (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN (which is providing CN-), the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

CH2(C)(OH)(CH(CH3)) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, so the product would be (CH3)2
