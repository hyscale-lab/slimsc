Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out which major products are formed in each reaction. Then, I'll match them with the given options to find the correct answer.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, I'm thinking this is probably an enolate formation reaction. When a ketone reacts with a base, especially a bulky one, it tends to form the more substituted enolate because of Zaitsev's rule, which says that the more substituted alkene is more stable. Wait, but wait, in this case, it's a cyclohexanone derivative. So, the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at positions 2 and 6.

The structure of the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at carbon 1. Carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). So, the substituents are arranged in a way that might influence where the enolate forms.

When t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone, which protons are available? The alpha protons adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in cyclohexanone, the alpha positions are carbons 2 and 6, if I'm not mistaken. But wait, the starting molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, so the carbonyl is at C1. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. But wait, C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, and C6 is another methyl. So, the possible sites for deprotonation would be the alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the molecule is cyclohexanone, so the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So, the enolate would form by deprotonating either C2 or C6. But considering the substituents, C2 has more substituents (ethyl and methyl) than C6, which is only a methyl. So, when a bulky base like t-BuOK is used, it tends to abstract the less hindered proton, but wait, no. Wait, the base's bulkiness affects where it can abstract a proton. So, in a crowded environment, the base might prefer to take a proton from a less hindered position. Alternatively, it's about the stability of the enolate. The more substituted the enolate, the more stable it is, so the base would abstract the proton that leads to the more substituted enolate, even if it's a bit more hindered.

Wait, in this molecule, the positions are C2 and C6. Let me draw this mentally. The cyclohexanone ring has the ketone at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. Position 6 has a methyl group. So, the alpha positions are C2 and C6.

If the base abstracts a proton from C2, it's already a highly substituted carbon. The enolate formed would have a negative charge on C2. But C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl, so perhaps the enolate at C2 would be more substituted, leading to better stability.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a
