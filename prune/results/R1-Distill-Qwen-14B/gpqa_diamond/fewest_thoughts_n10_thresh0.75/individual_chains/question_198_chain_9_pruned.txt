Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I remember that Co with different numbers of SCN- ligands can form different colored complexes. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} can have different n values. The blue one is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} because I think that's the one with two SCN- ligands. Oh but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right?

Stability constants (β) are given for each complex. Stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and ligands. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So the complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+       β1 =9
Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 β2=40
Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- β3=63
Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^2- β4=16

Wait, but stability constants are for each step. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} would involve the product of the individual βs up to that n. Or wait, actually, the β given are for each successive ligand addition. So the overall β for, say, the second complex
