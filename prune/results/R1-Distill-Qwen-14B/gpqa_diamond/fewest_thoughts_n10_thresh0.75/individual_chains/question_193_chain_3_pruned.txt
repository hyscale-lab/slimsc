Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx^5). The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, I think it's in parsecs. Oh right, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The problem states that N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Since d is 1/plx, let's substitute that. So, 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 is d^5. Because (1/plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So we're looking for the number of stars as a function of distance. But how does the number change with r (distance) per unit range? So probably, they want the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r, or maybe the
