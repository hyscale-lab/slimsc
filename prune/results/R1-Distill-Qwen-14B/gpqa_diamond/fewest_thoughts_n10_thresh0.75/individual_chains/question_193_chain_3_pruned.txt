Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. They've mentioned that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power (1/plx^5). I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. So let me think about that.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (plx in arcseconds). So plx = 1 / distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes, farther stars have smaller.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the number varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation. So replacing plx with 1/d gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5, which is the same as saying N is proportional to distance to the fifth power.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if I think about it, when you move a small distance dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area times the thickness, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, maybe not. Because the question states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, and we're to find how it changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of distance. So since N ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ (d)^5. So as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that can't be right because at larger distances, you'd expect fewer stars, or maybe more, but I'm not
