Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm. So, we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 to x=3. So the task is to find the value of a.

Wait, but wait. I remember that wave functions must be normalizable. Oh right! Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

But in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, wait. The wave function in quantum mechanics is usually a complex function. So this must be a complex wave function.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function is a function of x. So it's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Hmm, but wait a second. That can't be right. Or can it? Because usually, the wave function is a sum of real and imaginary parts. So ψ(x) is a complex function, and the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be 1, because the particle is only found between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as a function that's valid only where the particle exists. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². It's the square of the modulus, so (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 + something else? Wait, no. Because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is (a)^2 + (b)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the modulus squared is (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )² + (0.5)^2. Because ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + i*(-0.5
