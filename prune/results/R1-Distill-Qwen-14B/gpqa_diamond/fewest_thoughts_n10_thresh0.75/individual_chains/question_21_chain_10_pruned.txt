Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember some of these concepts from my notes, but I need to think through them carefully.

So the question has two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B asks which compound shows optical isomerism. We're given four options, each assigning A and B to different compounds.

The compounds mentioned are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

First, let me tackle part A: which of these compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism, if I recall correctly, happens when a molecule can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair of electrons between two atoms, usually adjacent ones, leading to the formation of different isomers. This is also known as keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the molecule must have a structure that allows such a shift. Typically, this involves a carbonyl group adjacent to another group where a hydrogen can move.

Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene where two of the oxygen atoms are in a quinoid structure. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Let me visualize it. Benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms in a ring, each attached to a carbon, making it a diketone. So, it's O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms in a conjugated system. Like, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, each alternate carbon has a ketone. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C in a ring. That's a tricyclic structure.

Now, can these compounds undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism in cyclic ketones... Well, if the molecule has adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe that's a factor. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. I'm trying to remember if it can tautomerize. Hmm. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. Benzoquinone is a conjugated system. Wait, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, so they're not adjacent to each other. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't have the necessary structure for keto-enol tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are not adjacent. Because for enol formation, you usually have a single carbonyl with adjacent hydrogens.

Wait, no, benzoquinone is a ring with two ketone groups. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O? No, wait, benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms in the ring, each as carbonyls. So for example, the structure is like a benzene
