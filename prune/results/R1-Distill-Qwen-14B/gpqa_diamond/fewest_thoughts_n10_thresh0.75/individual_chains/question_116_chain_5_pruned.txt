Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound D based on the reactions provided. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and reaction mechanisms, but let's think it through.

First, the problem states that compound A has two signals in its proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet (n=2) means each proton is next to two others. The 0.9 ppm region is usually for methyl groups attached to something, like maybe a CH2 or perhaps a cyclohexane ring. The quartet (n=3) at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests maybe a set of four protons next to three others, like maybe two CH2 groups adjacent to each other or another CH2 group.

Wait, the 6H as a triplet—maybe that's two equivalent methyl groups. Because a triplet in a methyl group could mean each methyl is next to a CH2. So for example, if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, each methyl proton would split into a triplet. Because each CH3 is attached to a CH2 that has two neighboring H's (like from another CH2 group). So that would give a triplet for the methyls.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of those protons is next to three others. 4H suggests maybe two sets of two equivalent protons each. So perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups. Like a -CH2CH2- structure. Because each CH2 in the middle would be next to two CH2 groups, but wait, no, if it's a straight chain, the middle CH2 would have two neighboring groups, but in a ring it's different. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent CH2 groups. Hmm.

Let me think of possible structures for compound A. The triplet 6H and quartet 4H. Wait, another possibility is that it's a di-substituted cyclohexane. For example, two methyl groups (each CH3) attached to a cyclohexane ring, and perhaps another substituent that's a CH2CH2 group or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe compound A is a diethyl ether derivative? But that might not fit. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic structure, but that might complicate things.

Wait, wait, another approach. The triplet for 6H—so 6 protons in total. That could be two CH3 groups (each 3H) attached to a CH2 group. Because each CH3 would be split by the adjacent CH2's protons. So if you have a structure like CH2CH2(C)(C), no, wait. Perhaps it's more like a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's something like diethyl ether, but that might not fit the NMR. Let me think about the splitting. Diethyl ether would have a triplet for the CH3 groups, but the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet for the CH2. But the quartet in the problem is 4H, which fits OCH2CH3 (each CH3 would give triplet, but other parts... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane with ethyl groups.

Wait, another angle: the quartet is 4H. So maybe it's two CH2 groups, each with two protons, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps something like CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit the triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from a -CH2CH2- bridge in a ring structure. Let's think of cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, let me think of the structure of compound A. If it's cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached, each ethyl group being CH2CH3. The ethyl
