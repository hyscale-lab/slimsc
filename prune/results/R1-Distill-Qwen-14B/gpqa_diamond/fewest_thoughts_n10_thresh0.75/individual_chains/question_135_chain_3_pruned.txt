Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think this through.

The problem says that the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo. Oh, probably it's more like L = -λ ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, maybe that's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps it's L = -λ f (y) X(y) ψψ-bar or something similar? I'm a bit confused by the notation. But perhaps the important part is that the boson X interacts with fermions. So the interaction term is something like λ times X(y) times the product of fermion fields.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. That is, what particles can X decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, in particle physics, for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion mass has to be less than half the boson's mass. Because the energy needs to be enough to create the pair (since you need two particles, each taking some energy). So the maximum mass that a fermion pair can have is when they are at rest relative to each other, so each has mass m, so the total is 2m. So, the boson's mass must be at least 2m for the decay to be possible.

So the boson X has mass 6 GeV. So, which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's list the known fermion masses (quarks and leptons):

Leptons:
- Electron (e^-): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- Neutrinos: very light, but we're probably ignoring them for decays because the cross-sections are too small, and if the problem is about lowest order, maybe they don't consider neutrinos.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, so for each fermion f, the pair f and anti-f needs to have a combined mass <= 6 GeV. So, for each f, m_f * 2 <= 6 GeV.

Let's compute each fermion:

e: 0.511 MeV → 2e is 1.022 MeV → way less than 6 GeV. So, X can decay into e+
