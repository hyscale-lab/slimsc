Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, is that the correct form? Oh right, the standard form for Yukawa interactions is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So maybe this is a Yukawa coupling scenario.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the options are various fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest mass must be less than or equal to half the mass of X, right? Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion would need to have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So if X is at rest, the total energy of each pair (like b bbar) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, because the decay products can't exceed the available energy. So each fermion and antifermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the mass of each fermion is important. Because each fermion in the decay must have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass. Because in the decay X → f fbar, each f has mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X. So M_X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses. I remember the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so way less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (
