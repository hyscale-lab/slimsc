Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these organic chemistry concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents used are red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting compound. The name is a bit complicated, but let's break it down. The parent ring is cyclohexene, which has a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO) and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is like CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the structure should be a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 and 5 positions.

Wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So cyclohexene has double bond at position 3. The numbering would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). Also, there's a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the carboxylic acid is part of the name, so where is it attached? The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because in carboxylic acids, the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid group. So the ring would have the COOH group at position 1, formyl at 2, and vinyl at 5.

So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with COOH at carbon 1, CHO at carbon 2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So
