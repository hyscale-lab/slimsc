Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The process involves a condensation reaction, right? The general idea is that the amine adds to the carbonyl, forming an iminium ion, which then loses water to form the enamine.

Wait, the question says that the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to draw that structure. So, the main chain is pentan-2-ylidene, which is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- but no, the position is 2-ylidene, so perhaps it's CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-configured, so the substituents are opposite each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2 group with a double bond. Let me think: pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond at position 2. So structure would be CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that's 2-pentenyl? Wait, maybe it's (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium part is a positively charged ethylamine with a methyl group. So, the amine is N-methyl, and the other substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2 attached to a N-methyl group, and the ethanaminium part implies that the nitrogen is positively charged. So, maybe
