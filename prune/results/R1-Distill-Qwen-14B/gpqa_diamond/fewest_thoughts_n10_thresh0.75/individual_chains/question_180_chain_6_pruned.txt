Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

Alright, the system has 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A) to D), each with different values.

Wait, so since all the charges are the same, I think this is a problem involving the potential energy between like charges. Because like charges repel, the potential energy would be positive, and the system would have some minimum energy when the repulsion is accounted for.

But wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So I guess interactions between all pairs contribute to the potential energy. Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Hmm, this is a key point. The 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but what arrangement are they in? Are they all on the same point (which doesn't make sense because they would rep
