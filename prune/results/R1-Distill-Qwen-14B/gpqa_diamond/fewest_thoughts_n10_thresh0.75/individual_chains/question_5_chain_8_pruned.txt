Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when that observable is measured. So the eigenvector here would be a state where measuring the component P along direction n gives +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator in question is along a direction n in the x-z plane, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z, meaning the angle theta is probably measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So the direction vector n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates, I think. Like n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something? But since it's in x-z, the y-component is zero. So maybe the direction is (θ, φ) where φ=0 or something? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I need to construct the operator P along direction n first.

The operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z. Each component is given. Right, the problem gives P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, so to find the operator P along direction n, I need to take the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), but actually, since any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as a unit vector with components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis.

Wait
