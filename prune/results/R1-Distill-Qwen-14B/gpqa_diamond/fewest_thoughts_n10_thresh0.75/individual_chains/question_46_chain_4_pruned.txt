Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. They're asking how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Specifically, I think it's used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Wait, but the starting material here is an alkene, so maybe it's a ring-closing metathesis?

Let me think about the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it: 1-pentene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would have a branch. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, that would be four carbons, but pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene should be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me count: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Because pentene is five carbons, so positions 1 and 2 are double bond, then 3 has the methyl. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is for olefin metathesis. The process involves breaking and reforming double bonds. So, when Grubbs is used, it typically does a ring-closing if possible. Alternatively, it could cause some cross metathesis, but in this case, with only one
