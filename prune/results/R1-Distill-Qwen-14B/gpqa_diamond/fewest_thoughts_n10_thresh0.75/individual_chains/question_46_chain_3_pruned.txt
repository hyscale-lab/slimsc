Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, olefin metathesis is where the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. So it's like swapping the ends of the alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, does that matter here? Because Grubbs catalyst is for metathesis, which is a process that can proceed with some stereoselectivity, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

3-methylpent-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pentene has five carbons. The double bond starts at C1, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon. So the third carbon is CH(CH3), so the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait no, pent is five carbons. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, that's five, right. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be five carbons in total: C1 (CH2), C2 (CH-), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3). So yes, that's correct.

Now, racemic formâ€”so it's a 50
