Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find both their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember some stuff from my classes about special relativity, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think this through.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy. The options are A to D.

First, I think about relative speed in special relativity. Unlike classical mechanics where you just subtract the speeds, relativistic speeds don't work that way because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is: v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, which one is v1 and which is v2? Because they're moving in the same direction, right? So I guess astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So the relative speed of astronaut 1 from astronaut 2's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me compute that numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, that would match options C and D, which have v_rel=0.14c.

Now for the total energy. I recall that in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest energies. Each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to compute gamma for each and then sum their energies.

Let's compute gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.3
