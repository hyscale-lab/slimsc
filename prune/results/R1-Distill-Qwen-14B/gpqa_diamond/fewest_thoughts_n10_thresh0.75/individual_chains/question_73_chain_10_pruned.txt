Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally. I remember there's a relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, I have to be careful about the direction. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I subtract the smaller speed from the larger one. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula is actually (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of the first object from the perspective of the second, or is it the other way around? No, wait no, the formula is for when you have two frames, S and S'. Let's think: the relative velocity is when you have object A moving at u in S, and object B moving at v in S. Then the relative velocity of A as seen from B's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

So in this case, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c, both in the same direction (positive x). So from B's perspective, what's the speed of A? So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let me plug the numbers in.

So (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)]. Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Wait, that's about 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. Options A and B have 0.1c and 1.1c, which don't match.

Now the total energy of the system. Hmm, the problem says "the total energy of the system." I'm a bit confused whether it's the sum of their relativistic energies or the rest mass energy. Because in relativity, each object's energy is gamma * m c², but if they're moving relative to each other, combining their energies might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering their energies from the perspective of the same frame, perhaps the rest frame where one is moving and the other is considered.

Wait, wait. The problem says "the total energy of the system." So I need to compute the sum of their energies. But wait, which frame? Because in different
