Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) ) ? Or wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity shift and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) ) * something. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Wait another approach: the RV method detects the star's reflex motion. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π * P^(1/3)) )

But since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

Also, the orbits are circular, so e
