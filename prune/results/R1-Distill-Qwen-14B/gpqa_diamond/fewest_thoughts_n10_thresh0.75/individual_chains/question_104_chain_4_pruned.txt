Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in a spectral line. Planet #2's star had a shift of 7 milliangstrom. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift gives information about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The formula I think is related to the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The bigger the semi-amplitude, the higher the velocity shift.

Oh wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity (v). The formula I think is Δλ/λ₀ = v/c, where λ₀ is the original wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. But since the shifts are given in milliangstroms, which is 1e-3 of an angstrom, and assuming the same wavelength for both (since the same spectral line is used), the ratio of the velocity shifts should be the same as the ratio of the milliangstrom shifts.

So for the two planets, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but how does K relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method equation connects K with the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. Oh right, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (2π)^(1/3)) ) * ... wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v sin i) = ( (
