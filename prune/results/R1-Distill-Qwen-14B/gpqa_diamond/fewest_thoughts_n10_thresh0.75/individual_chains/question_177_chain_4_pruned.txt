Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure how mass plays into this. The question is about luminosity, right? So maybe mass isn't directly involved here, unless it's for something else like determining the radius or temperature via some other relation. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so I think I should focus on the black body radiation formulas.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for each star. According to Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So same λ_max implies same T.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature? That's interesting because Star_1 is larger in radius and mass, but same temperature. So now, I can think about the luminosity formula for black bodies. The luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)², because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same. So R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1/L2 would be 2.25. But wait, the options have A as 2.25, but let me check the question again.

Wait, no, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, it would be 2.25. But looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait a second
