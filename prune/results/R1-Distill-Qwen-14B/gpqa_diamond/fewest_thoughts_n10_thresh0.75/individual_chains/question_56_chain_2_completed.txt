Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions mean it's an electric dipole transition, right? So the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition is allowed only if the initial and final states have opposite parity. Oh wait, wait, the parity goes with (-1)^l, so if l changes by ±1, the parity would flip. Since 3,0,0 has l=0 (s orbital) and 1,0,0 also has l=0, their parities are same (since (-1)^0 is 1 for both). Wait, that's a problem because for dipole transitions, the parity must change so the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator (which has parity -1) isn't zero. Oh wait, because the dipole operator changes the parity. So the product must have an overall parity of 1 for the integral to be non-zero. So the parity of initial state times the dipole operator's parity (which is -1) should equal the parity of the final state. So initial parity is 1 (since l=0), dipole operator is -1. So 1 * (-1) = -1, which must equal the final state's parity. So the final state must have parity -1, which happens when l is odd. But our initial state is l=0, so for the first transition, the final state must have l=1, because 0 +1=1. Then, in the next transition, from l=1 to l=0. Because 1-1=0. So that makes sense.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, where m can be 0, ±1. Then from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>.

Now, what are the possible m values? Let's think. The first transition must have Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, the first transition can go to m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>.

Now, the question is about the transition probability. I think the probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole transition. But I'm not too clear on the exact calculations. I remember that for each allowed transition, the transition probability is proportional to certain factors, like the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3-j symbols. Alternatively, maybe the selection rules and the possible states determine the possible paths, and the probabilities are determined by the number of allowed paths.

Wait, but the question gives options with fractions, like 1/3 or 1/4 or 2/3. How would that come into play?

Wait, perhaps the number of ways to transition is considered. For example, from the initial state |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to three possible states: |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>. Then, each of these can transition to |1,0,0> in another step. But not all of them might lead directly to |1,0,0> in the second step.

Wait, let's think about the second transition. The first state after the first transition is |2,1, m>. From there, the second transition must go to |1,0,0>. So the selection rules for the second transition: Δl = -1 (since l goes from 1 to 0). And Δm can be 0, ±1. So for the second transition, if the first state is |2,1, m>, then m can change by 0, ±1 in the second step. But the final state is |1,0,0>, which has m=0. So in the second step, the m must go from m' to 0, so m' can be 0, ±1.

Wait no, in the second step, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, so the change in m is 0 - m. So that must be Δm = -m. Which must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. So Δm can be 0, ±1. So for the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1.

So let's see: if the first transition landed on |2,1,0>, then the second transition's m would have to go from 0 to 0. So Δm is 0, which is allowed. So that is allowed.

If the first transition was to |2,1,1>, then the second transition would have to change m by -1, because 0 -1 = -1. So Δm would be -1, which is allowed because |Δm|=1≤1.

Similarly, if the first transition was to |2,1,-1>, then the second transition would require Δm = +1, which is allowed because |Δm|=1.

So all three intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0> in the second step. So all three paths are possible. Now, the question is about the transition probability. Each of these three paths would contribute to the total probability.

But what determines the probability of each path? The selection rules aren't giving us the probabilities directly. I think the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for each step, multiplied by the possible ways.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible dipole transition has a certain probability, and the overall transition is a sum over all possible intermediate states.

Wait, but the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions. So the path involves two steps. So the total transition probability would be the sum of the probabilities for each possible two-step path.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability for the transition from n1 l1 m1 to n2 l2 m2 via dipole is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, but I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the possible transitions are allowed when the dipole operator's components (x, y, z) can cause the change in m. For example, the dipole operator in spherical coordinates has components proportional to spherical harmonics Y_{1m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So transitions are allowed when m changes by -1, 0, +1.

So for the first transition, from |3,0,0> (m=0) to |2,1, m>, m can be 0, +1, -1.

Similarly, the second transition from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0> (m=0) must have m change by 0, +1, or -1.

So for each intermediate state |2,1, m>, the transition is allowed if m_final = m_initial + delta_m, where delta_m is -1,0,+1.

Let me make a table:

Intermediate state after first transition | allowed second transitions to |1,0,0>?
|2,1,0> → can go to m=0 (delta_m=0) → allowed.
|2,1,1> → to m=0, delta_m = -1 → allowed.
|2,1,-1> → to m=0, delta_m = +1 → allowed.

So all three possibilities are allowed. So there are three possible two-step paths.

Now, if each of these three paths has the same probability, then the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path. But I'm not sure if each path has the same probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are different for each m. For example, the transition for m=0 in the intermediate state might have a different probability than m=1 or m=-1.

In the non-relativistic theory, the transition probability from an initial state |n_i, l_i, m_i> to a final state |n_f, l_f, m_f> is proportional to the square of the matrix element <n_f l_f m_f | e r | n_i l_i m_i>, where e is the charge and r is the position operator (dipole approximation).

The position operator r in spherical coordinates has components proportional to Y_{10}, Y_{11}, Y_{1-1}.

Wait, I think the matrix element can be expressed using the Wigner 3-j symbols or the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The matrix element is non-zero only if the angular momentum selection rules are satisfied, which they are in these cases.

The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For the initial state |3,0,0>, when it transitions to |2,1,m>, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (3)(3+1) )/( (2)(2+1)(1)(1+1) )^(½) ) but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability from a state with l=0 (s orbital) to l=1 (p orbital) has certain properties. For example, the allowed m transitions are 0→0, 0→+1, 0→-1. So each of these three possible m's in the intermediate state is allowed.

But in terms of probabilities, perhaps m=0 has a higher probability than m=±1, because the transition for m=0 is possibly stronger? Or is it symmetric?

Wait, the dipole operator has components in all three directions (x, y, z), which correspond to m = -1, 0, +1. So each transition with m change 0, +1, -1 is equally allowed. Therefore, the number of possible ways for each m might be the same. So for the first transition, each of the three m's (0, +1, -1) is equally probable.

If that's the case, then the probability for each path is 1/3. So the probability for each of the three paths is 1/3, and since all three contribute to the total probability, the total is 3 * (1/3) = 1. That can't be right, because the question is about the probability of going from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two steps.

Wait, no. The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each individual two-step path. So each two-step path has a certain probability, and the sum of all possible paths is the total probability.

Hmm, perhaps each dipole transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of available states, weighted by the selection rules. For the first step, there are three possible intermediate states. The second step from each of these intermediates also has one possible way (since each intermediate can go to |1,0,0>). So the total number of possible two-step paths is three.

But the question is about the probability for each of the given options. Looking at the options, some only have one intermediate state. For example, option A goes via |2,1,0>, option B via |2,1,1>, etc.

Wait, the options list specific transition paths, each with a given probability. So the correct answer would be the option that correctly identifies the transition path and the probability.

I think the possible transition paths are the three I mentioned (m=0, 1, -1), each with a certain probability. The options don't list all three, but only give specific options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

Option B: same, but via |2,1,1>, probability 1/4.

Option C: via |2,1,-1>, probability 1/4.

Option D: the first step isn't written correctly (probably typo, maybe |2,1,0>), and the probability is 2/3.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to realize that the transition probabilities for each m are different. The probability for each path depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which may not be the same for each m.

Wait, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding angular momenta. In this case, the initial state has l=0 (s-state) and the dipole operator has l=1. So the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> is being acted upon by the dipole operator (l=1) to transition to l=1 states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is sqrt( (2*l +1)/( (l + l' +1)(l + l' -1) )) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=m to get l=1, m=0 is sqrt( ( ( 2*l +1 ) ) / ( 4 * (2*l +1) ) ) )? I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the square of (2l +1)/(something). Wait, perhaps the transition probability for each m is proportional to (2 - m^2) or something like that. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability from l=0 to l=1 is the same for m=0, m=1, and m=-1. So each of the three paths would have the same probability, so each contributes 1/3 of the total transition probability.

Wait, but the total probability is not 1; the question is about the probability of a specific two-step decay path. So for example, option A is one specific path (the one through m=0), and the probability is 1/3. So that would imply that the other two paths (m=1 and m=-1) each contribute 1/3, and the total probability for all possible paths would be 1.

But the question is asking about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct option would list a specific route and the probability of that particular route.

Wait, that makes sense. So if each of the three possible intermediate states contributes equally, then each path's probability is 1/3, so option A, which states the path via m=0 with probability 1/3, would be correct.

But wait, I'm not sure if each m contributes equally. Another thought: when the initial state has m=0, the matrix elements for the dipole operator (which has components with m=-1, 0, +1) would have different contributions. The transition to m=0 would involve the Y_{10} component, while m=1 would involve Y_{11}, and m=-1 would involve Y_{1-1}.

The overlap integrals would determine the probabilities. For the initial state with m=0, the transition to m=0 would involve the integral of Y_{10} times Y_{00} times Y_{10}, perhaps? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the integral for m=0 is non-zero, as are those for m=1 and m=-1.

Another approach: the probability for each transition (m) is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m to get l=1, m_total = m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m is sqrt( ( (1 + m)! (1 - m)! ) / (2 (1 + 1)! ) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for l=0 and l'=1 to combine into L=1, the coefficients can be found.

Wait, from what I recall, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get L=1 are:

For m=1: the coefficient is sqrt( (1 - 0 + 1)/(4) ) )? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of ways to reach each m in the intermediate state. Since the initial state has m=0, and the dipole operator has m= -1, 0, +1, the possible m's for the intermediate state are 0, +1, -1. So each possible m has an equal chance? Or perhaps not.

Wait, I think the transition probabilities for each m in the first step are proportional to (2l +1)/( (l + l') (l - l' +1) ) ), but I'm not exactly confident.

Alternatively, I think that for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's in the intermediate state are 0, +1, -1, each with equal probability because of symmetry. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0, l=0), the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 should be the same.

So if each of the three possible intermediate states has an equal probability, the probability for each path (m=0, m=+1, m=-1) is 1/3. So, the total probability for each path is 1/3, and the sum would be 1.

Now, looking back at the options, option A has a probability of 1/3 for the m=0 path. So if the question is asking for the probability of the specific path via m=0, then option A is correct. But wait, the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". So the correct answer is the option that correctly identifies a route with the correct probability.

Alternatively, I might be wrong. Another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> requires two dipole transitions. The first step must increase l by 1 (since l starts at 0 and must reach 1 in two steps). So the first transition increases l from 0 to 1, then the second step decreases l from 1 to 0.

Each transition's probability depends on the square of the matrix element. I think that the total transition probability from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> is the sum of the probabilities of all possible two-step paths. But the question is about the probability of a specific path, not the total.

Wait, but the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are..." So the correct option must list a specific path and its probability.

So, if each possible path (three in total) has a probability of 1/3, then any of the options A, B, or C would be correct. But since the options only give one correct answer, perhaps the correct answer is A because the other options have probabilities of 1/4 and 2/3, which don't fit the equal probability assumption.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another thought: perhaps the matrix element for the transition changes m by 0, 1, or -1, and the probabilities are different for each m.

For example, for the first transition, the probability for each m is proportional to (2 - m^2). So m=0 would have a higher probability than m=1 or m=-1.

Wait, I think that's correct. The transition probability for m is proportional to (2 - m^2). For l=0 and l=1, the transition matrix elements are proportional to that. So for m=0, it's 2, m=1 and m=-1, it's 1.

So the probabilities for each m in the first transition are:

m=0: 2

m=1:1

m=-1:1

So the total number of possible ways is 2 +1 +1 =4.

So each m=0 transition has a probability of 2/4=1/2, and each of the others is 1/4.

Wait, so the first transition to m=0 has a probability of 1/2, and the others each 1/4.

Then, the second transition from m=0 to m=0 is allowed (as we said before), and similarly for the others.

But now, each two-step path's probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

So:

Path 1: m=0 → m=0. Probability = (1/2) * 1 (since from m=0 to m=0, it's allowed, but what is its probability?).

Wait, perhaps the second transition's probability depends on the same (2 - m'^2) factor. So from m' =0, the transition to m=0 is allowed, but what is the probability?

Wait, this approach might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total probability for each two-step path is (probability of first step) multiplied by (probability of second step).

But I'm not confident. Let me think about it differently. For the first transition, the probabilities are:

m=0: 1/2

m=1:1/4

m=-1:1/4

Then, for the second transition, the probability for each path would be:

From m=0 to m=0: the same calculation applies. The transition is allowed, and the probability is perhaps 1/2 again? So the path probability is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

From m=1 to m=0: the change is Δm = -1, so the probability is (1/4) * (probability for m=1 to m=0). But what is the probability for the second transition?

Wait, maybe for the second transition (from l=1 to l=0), the transition probability is again determined by the same (2 - m'^2) factor. So for the second transition, the initial m is m', and the final m is 0.

So the transition probability for each m' is proportional to (2 - m'^2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has a higher probability than the others because m doesn't change, so the matrix element is larger. So the path through m=0 is more probable.

If that's the case, the probability for the path via m=0 might be higher. So for the first transition, the probability for m=0 is higher, and then the second transition from m=0 to m=0 is also high.

In that case, option A, which has a probability of 1/3, seems plausible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the probability is 2/3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The possible two-step transitions would have their probabilities calculated as follows: the initial state |3,0,0> can go to any of the three l=1 states, and each of those can transition to |1,0,0>.

The total number of possible two-step paths is 3, and each would have a certain probability.

But the overall probability for the entire decay (any path) is the sum of the probabilities of each path.

But the question is about a specific route and its probability. So, for example, the option A says the path via |2,1,0> has a probability of 1/3, which would imply that the other two paths each have 1/3, summing to 1. But wait, that would give a total probability of 1, which would mean that this is the only possible decay path, which isn't correct because other transitions may also be possible.

Wait, no. The question is about the decay via two dipole transitions. So if the transition occurs via two steps, each with dipole transitions, then the total probability for that entire process would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible two-step path.

But the question isn't clear whether it's asking for the probability of a specific two-step path or the total probability of all possible two-step paths.

Wait, the question says, "the transition route and the corresponding probability are". So the correct option should list a specific route and the probability of that route.

So, if each of the three possible two-step paths has a probability of 1/3, then option A (path via m=0, 1/3) would be correct. But I'm not certain if the probabilities are equal.

Another thought: the transition from l=0 to l=1 via dipole has matrix elements proportional to the spherical harmonics Y_{1m}. The square of the matrix element is proportional to (2 - m^2). So for m=0, it's 2, m=1 and m=-1 are 1 each.

So the probability for each m in the first step is proportional to (2 - m^2). So the probabilities are:

m=0: 2/(2+1+1) )= 2/4 = 1/2

m=1: 1/4

m=-1: 1/4

Then, the second transition from each of these m's must go to m=0.

The second transition's probability is again proportional to (2 - m'^2), where m' is the m of the intermediate state.

So for the path via m=0:

First transition probability: 1/2

Second transition probability: from m=0 to m=0. The matrix element is again (2 - 0^2)=2. But wait, the second transition is from l=1 to l=0, so m' must go to 0. So the change in m is 0.

Wait, so for the second transition, the matrix element is proportional to (2 - m'^2).

So for m'=0 in the intermediate state, the transition probability is proportional to 2.

So the probability for the second transition in this path is 2/(2 +1 +1) )= 2/4=1/2.

So the total probability for this path is (1/2) * (1/2) )= 1/4.

Wait, no. Because the first transition's probability for m=0 is 1/2, and the second transition's probability is also 1/2, so the product is 1/4.

Similarly, for the path via m=1:

First transition probability: 1/4

Second transition: from m=1 to m=0. The matrix element is proportional to (2 - (1)^2) =1.

So the probability for the second transition is 1/4.

So the product is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum would be 1/4 (for m=0) + 1/16 (m=1) + 1/16 (m=-1) )= 1/4 + 2/16 = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8, which is less than 1. But that can't be right because other decay paths could exist, but the question is about decaying via two dipole transitions.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe the probabilities for the first and second transitions are not multiplied, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall probability is the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the transition probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the square of the sum of the matrix elements. But I'm getting lost here.

Another approach: perhaps in the hydrogen atom, the transition probabilities for different m are weighted according to the square of the matrix elements. So for the first transition, the probabilities for m=0,1,-1 are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4, as I thought earlier.

Then, for the second transition, each of these has a certain probability. For the path via m=0, the second transition from m=0 to m=0 has a probability of 1/2, so the total for that path is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Similarly, for the path via m=1, the second transition probability is 1/4. Because from m=1, the transition to m=0 is allowed with a probability factor of 1/4 (since the matrix element for m=1 is 1, and the sum is 2 +1 +1 =4).

Wait, but then the path via m=1 would contribute 1/4 (first step) * 1/4 (second step) = 1/16.

Similarly, the path via m=-1 would also contribute 1/16.

So the total probability for all paths is 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/4 + 2/16 = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8.

But that's less than one, implying that there are other decay paths not considered here, such as via other n and l values, but the question specifies two dipole transitions.

Wait, but the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions, so perhaps there are other possibilities, but the options only consider specific paths.

Wait, but the question is about the correct transition route and its probability. So perhaps the correct option is the one with the highest probability, which is the path via m=0 with 1/4.

Wait, no, option A has a probability of 1/3, which is higher than 1/4.

But according to my previous calculation, the path via m=0 has a probability of 1/4, so option A (1/3) doesn't fit. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another angle. I recall that for the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, the possible m values are 0, ±1. The transition probability is proportional to (2 - m^2) for each m.

So for m=0: 2, m=1:1, m=-1:1.

So the probabilities for the first transition are 2/(2+1+1)=1/2 for m=0, and 1/4 each for m=1 and m=-1.

Then, the second transition from l=1 to l=0. Again, the transition probabilities are proportional to (2 - m'^2), where m' is the initial state's m.

So, for the second transition from m' =0, the probability is 2/(2+1+1)=1/2.

From m'=1, the probability is 1/4.

From m'=-1, the probability is 1/4.

So for each two-step path:

Path 1: m=0 → m=0. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Path 2: m=1 → m=0. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.

Path 3: m=-1 → m=0. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.

So the total probability is 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 3/8.

But that's the total probability for all possible two-step paths. The question, however, is about the probability of a specific path.

So if the question is asking about the specific path via m=0, the probability would be 1/4. But none of the options have 1/4 except options B and C.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 1/3

Option B: 1/4

Option C:1/4

Option D:2/3

So according to this, if the correct path is via m=0, its probability is 1/4, which matches option B or C.

Wait, but option B goes via |2,1,1>, and option C via |2,1,-1>, each with 1/4.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the path via m=0 has a higher probability of 1/4, while the others are 1/16 each. But maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities are not multiplied but added in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the total probability for each path is based on the square of the sum of the matrix elements.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another thought: perhaps in the first transition, the probability for m=0 is higher, but the second transition from m=0 has a higher probability than the others.

So if the path via m=0 has the highest probability, perhaps that's the correct option. But according to my previous calculation, the path via m=0 has probability 1/4, which is higher than 1/16 for the others.

So the correct option would be the one that lists the path via m=0 with a probability of 1/4. But looking at the options, none of them say 1/4 for m=0. Option A says 1/3 for m=0.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is completely off. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I can't see why. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities are 2/3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions is possible only if the sum of the changes in l is 2 (0 +1 +1 =2). So each step changes l by +1 and then -1.

Now, the possible intermediate states are |2,1, m> where m=0, ±1.

The transition probabilities from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> are proportional to (2 - m^2).

So:

m=0: 2, m=1:1, m=-1:1.

So the probabilities are 2/4=1/2, and 1/4 each.

Then, the transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> is again proportional to (2 - m^2).

So:

For m=0: 2 → probability 1/2.

For m=1:1 → 1/4.

For m=-1:1 → 1/4.

So, the total probability for each path is (probability of first step) × (probability of second step).

So:

Path via m=0: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.

Path via m=1: (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16.

Path via m=-1: (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16.

So, the total for all paths is 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 3/8.

But the options don't include 3/8. The options give probabilities for individual paths, not the sum.

So the question is about the probability for a specific path. So the correct option would be the one that lists a path with a probability of 1/4, which are options B and C.

But in the options, B goes via m=1 with probability 1/4, and C via m=-1, same probability.

So, between options B and C, which one is correct?

Wait, but the transition from |2,1,1> to |1,0,0> would have a probability of 1/4, as would |2,1,-1>.

So both options B and C have a probability of 1/4.

But the options are structured as "the transition route and the corresponding probability are", so multiple options could be correct, but the question says which option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or C, but they are different routes. Hmm, but the options are distinct, so perhaps the correct answer is B or C, but the question includes them both as separate options. Wait, looking again:

Option B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/4.

So both B and C have the same probability, but different paths.

But according to the calculation, the path via m=0 has a higher probability (1/4) than the others (1/16 each), but the options don't include that. Wait, no, the path via m=0 has a probability of 1/4, but option A has probability 1/3. So perhaps the correct option is not among the given choices, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probability is 1/3 for each m, making the total for each path 1/9, but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which says the probability is 2/3, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total number of possible two-step transitions is 3 (m=0, 1, -1). Each has a probability of 1/3, so the probability for each specific path is 1/3. That would align with option A, which states a probability of 1/3 for the m=0 path.

But earlier I calculated that the path via m=0 has a higher probability than the others. So this is conflicting.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given that the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), the transition to m=0 in the intermediate state might have a higher probability. So the path via m=0 would have a higher probability than the others. So the correct option would be the one with the path via m=0 and a higher probability, like option A (1/3) or D (2/3).

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, another thought: the transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two steps would have a probability proportional to the square of the product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each step.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is:

For m=0: sqrt( (1*(1+1)) / ( (0 +1 +1) (0 +1 -1 +1) )) ) ?

Wait, I think I'm getting too lost here. Given time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which goes via m=0 with a probability of 1/3. But I'm not fully confident.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Selection Rules and Transition Paths**:  
   - For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.  
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) can transition to intermediate states |2,1,m⟩ where m = 0, ±1.  
   - From each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) is allowed if Δm = 0, ±1.

2. **Possible Intermediate States**:  
   - The intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.  
   - All three intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0⟩ in the second step.

3. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   - The probability of each transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the matrix elements of the dipole operator.  
   - For the first transition, the probabilities for m=0, ±1 are proportional to (2 - m²), giving probabilities of 1/2 for m=0 and 1/4 each for m=1 and m=-1.  
   - For the second transition, the probabilities are similarly determined by (2 - m'²), where m' is the m-value of the intermediate state.

4. **Total Probability for Each Path**:  
   - The total probability for each two-step path is the product of the probabilities of the first and second transitions.  
   - Path via |2,1,0⟩: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.  
   - Path via |2,1,1⟩: (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16.  
   - Path via |2,1,-1⟩: (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16.  
   - The total probability across all paths is 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 3/8.

5. **Interpretation of the Question**:  
   - The question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for a specific path.  
   - Option A states the path via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3, which does not match the calculated probability of 1/4 for this path.  
   - Options B and C state the paths via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩, each with a probability of 1/4, which aligns with the calculated probabilities for these paths.  
   - Option D appears inconsistent with the calculations.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - The correct answer is the path via |2,1,1⟩ or |2,1,-1⟩, each with a probability of 1/4.  
   - Among the given options, both B and C are valid, but the question requires selecting one. Based on the calculations, the path via |2,1,1⟩ is chosen.
