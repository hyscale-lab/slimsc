Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that for spin operators, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles like a muon, which this question is about.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices. Let's break this down.

First, the X-component P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix has [0,1] in the first row and [1,0] in the second. So the matrix looks like:

[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Wait, these look familiar. Oh right! These are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it's along direction n. The direction has components (n_x, n_y, n_z), and since it's in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The operator for the direction n would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since P_y is zero here. So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

We're looking for the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P · n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no—the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

[ (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) ]
