Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, and there are three separate reactions given with their reactants and products to identify. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different products.

First, I need to remember what the Michael addition is. From what I recall, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, leading to a conjugate addition, forming an enolate intermediate, which then gets protonated. The product is a new carbon-carbon bond between the nucleophile and the beta position.

So let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So I need to figure out what happens when these two react.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. It's a diester, so when deprotonated, it can attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is an acrylate: CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the 3 position being p-tolyl (a methyl group attached to a benzene ring). So the structure is something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is at the gamma position? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The structure of acrylate is typically CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OEt, with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. No, wait, the numbering is such that the carbonyl is at position 1. So the double bond is between 1 and 2, the carbonyl is at 1. Then position 3 would be the next carbon after the double bond. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me draw it.

Wait, wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate group is CH₂=CH–COOCH₃. But the 3-position is the second carbon in the acrylate chain. So perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH₃? Wait, that can't be right because that would imply
