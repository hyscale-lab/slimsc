Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to visualize it.

So, the question describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and it's positioned such that its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, wait. The problem says that the radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Got it.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from point P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are different expressions for the electric field E at point P. I'm supposed to find which one is correct.

Let me remember what I know about conductors and electric fields. So, in electrostatics, when a conductor is neutral (uncharged) and there's a charge inside a cavity, the charges in the conductor redistribute themselves to cancel the electric fields inside the conductor itself, except for the region inside the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor is uncharged. So if there's a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, the conductor being neutral, the charges inside it will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have a charge induced. Since the charge inside is positive, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Coulomb's law: the charge inside the cavity would induce opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. So a +q inside would cause the inner surface to have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance the total charge, but since the conductor is neutral, wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor
