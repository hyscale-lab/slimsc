Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions, A and B, and I need to select the correct major products from the given options. Let me break it down.

First, reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, what's that about?

BuLi is a strong base, a butyllithium. It's commonly used for deprotonating compounds, especially in alkyllithium formation. The starting compound looks like a benzene ring with an ether substituent. The substituent is an (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, wait: it's ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is benzene-O-(CH2)-something. Let me draw this out.

The substituent is OCH2, but wait, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, benzene ring connected to an OCH2 group. The O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me think: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but wait, butenyl means four carbons. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 2? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the substituent is 3-methyl, so maybe the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached via the first carbon.
