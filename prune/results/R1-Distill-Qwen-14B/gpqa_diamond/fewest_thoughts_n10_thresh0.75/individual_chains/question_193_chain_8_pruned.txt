Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I remember is that distance (r) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax, so r ≈ 1/plx. Wait, but I think that's in parsecs. So yeah, the parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs.

The number of stars (N) is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since r is proportional to 1/plx, I can substitute that into the equation. Let me write that down.

So if r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. So substituting that into N, which is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5?

Wait, but wait. But wait a second, I need to think about the actual relationship between the number of stars and the distance. Because when you look further away, you have a larger volume to look into, so more stars. But how does that translate to the number with respect to distance?

Oh, right! The number of stars in a region typically depends on the volume. Volume depends on the cube of the radius (like a spherical shell). But wait, that's when the number increases with the volume, which is r^3. But in this case, the number of stars is given in a specific relation involving parallax.

Let me clarify. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. So substituting into N, N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5.

Wait, that suggests that as r increases, N increases as r^5. But that seems really steep. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range
