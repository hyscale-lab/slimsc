Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B could be. Let's break down the clues.

Starting with the melting point of B: 277 K is approximately -106°C. That's pretty cold. What substances have such low melting points? Maybe something like CO2, but dry ice sublimates at -78°C, which is 195 K. Wait, no, that's too low. Alternatively, maybe a hydrocarbon? Or perhaps something like a metal that sublimates?

Wait, another thought: B is a product when G is heated. If G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate or a hydroxide. When heated, maybe it decomposes. Like calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be the oxide. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might dehydrate it to form an oxide.

But wait, let's think about the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is either H2O (neutrons: O has 8, so H2O has 2 H (each 1 neutron) and O with 8. So protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8, so total neutrons 8. Wait, that doesn't match. So H2O's protons are 10, neutrons 8. Not equal.

Wait another option: CO2. Its molecular formula is CO2. Protons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since it's C-12?), O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 =
