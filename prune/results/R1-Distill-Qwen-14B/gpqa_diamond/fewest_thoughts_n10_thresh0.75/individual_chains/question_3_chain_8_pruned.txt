Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state and asks about the expectation value of a certain operator. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

Alright, the state of the particle is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. Oh right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix. So for σz, |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ has eigenvalue -1. That's important because when calculating expectation values, eigenstates are easier to handle.

The operator in question is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. The expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on identically prepared systems. So, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

Let me recall the formula for expectation value. For an operator O, it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for 10σz +5σx.

Wait, expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier. So I just need to find the expectation values of σz and σx individually.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. |↑⟩ is usually [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. But since σz is diagonal in this basis, maybe it's easier to just calculate it using the coefficients.

Wait, σz matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you multiply σz with |↑⟩, you get 1*|↑⟩, and with |↓⟩, you get -1*|↓⟩. So when you calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, it's the sum of each term's coefficient squared times their eigenvalues.

So, for |↑⟩, the coefficient is 0.5. Its square is 0.25. The eigenvalue is +1. So that contributes 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.

For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. Its square is (3/4) = 0.75. The eigenvalue is -1. So that term contributes 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them together: 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Therefore, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. This operator is not diagonal in the σz basis, so calculating its expectation value might be a bit more involved.

Wait, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ can be found using the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute this step by step.

Another approach: For a spin-1/2 particle in state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b) because σx's expectation is 2*(Re(ab*) ) - 1? Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ can be calculated as 2*(probability of ↑ in σx basis minus probability of ↓ in σx basis?), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's easier to compute it directly using the matrix.

Let me write down |ψ⟩ as a vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Then, σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩.

So, compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩: which is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Since all coefficients are real, I don't need to worry about complex conjugation except for the signs, which might not matter here.

So, [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. The dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Calculating each term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330. And the second term is the same, so together it's 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the correct way to compute ⟨σx⟩? Because ⟨σx⟩ for a spin-½ particle is given by 2*(Re(ab*) ), perhaps? Let me think
