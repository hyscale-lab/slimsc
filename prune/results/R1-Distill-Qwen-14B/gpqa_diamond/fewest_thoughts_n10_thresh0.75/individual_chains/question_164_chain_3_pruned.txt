Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about binary star systems—so two stars orbiting each other. There are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods between primary eclipses are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. So I think this has to do with Kepler's laws and the relationship between the masses of the stars and their orbital velocities.

Wait, I remember that in a binary star system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star would be closer to the center, and the less massive one would orbit more around it. The radial velocity amplitude is related to how fast each star is moving towards or away from us. The more massive star should have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less—the less massive one moves more.

So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's see, the more massive star would have the smaller velocity. So in system_1, the star with 5 km/s is more massive? Or wait, wait. No, actually, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's contributing less to the movement—because it's the larger mass around which the smaller one is orbiting. So if one star's velocity is higher, that means it's less massive.

Wait, I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, a simpler way for a binary system: the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if the masses are M1 and M2, then M1 * v1 = M2 * v2.

Because in the center of mass frame, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius, so v = ω a. So M1 v1 = M2 v2.

Ah, that's right. So for each binary system, the product of the mass and velocity of each star is the same. So M1 * v1 = M2 * v2.

Wait, so for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me denote them as v1 and v2.

So M1 * v1 = M2 * v2.

So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Wait, no, because M1 * v1 =
