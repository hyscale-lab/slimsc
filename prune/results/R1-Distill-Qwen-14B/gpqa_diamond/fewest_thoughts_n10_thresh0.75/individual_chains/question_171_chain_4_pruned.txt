Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, electrophilic substitution... I remember that's when a hydrogen atom in an aromatic ring is replaced by an electrophile, like Br2 in this case.

The substances given are six different benzene derivatives. Each is undergoing bromination. I need to arrange them from the lowest to highest weight fraction of the para product. Wait, wait. The question says "increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer." So the order is from the least to the most para-product.

I remember that activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. If a substituent is activating, it donates electrons and directs the attack to ortho, para positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite, making the ring less reactive and directing meta.

But wait, some substituents are stronger than others. For example, nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. On the other hand, groups like -OCH3 are activating and para/ortho directors. 

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group. That's an activating, ortho/para director. So the incoming Br would go to para or ortho. But in bromination of toluene, the para isomer is major, I think. Because steric hindrance in ortho can sometimes make para more favorable, especially in cases where the substituent is bulky. Wait, methyl isn't that bulky, but maybe for toluene, the para is major.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ester group. The substituent is COOEt. Wait, the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene. Ester groups are meta directors because they're electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl). Wait, no, esters are ortho/para directors but deactivating? Or are they deactivating and meta?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The substituents can be classified based on their activating or deactivating nature. 

Ester groups (like COOR) are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing by resonance. So the ring becomes less
