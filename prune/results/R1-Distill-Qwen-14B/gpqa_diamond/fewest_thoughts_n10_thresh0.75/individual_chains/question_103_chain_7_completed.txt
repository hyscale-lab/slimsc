Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. And I need to figure out which sequence of reactions from the options A to D will achieve this with high yield. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, there's an ethan-1-one group attached. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone, so the structure is benzoyl with a methyl group attached? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That would be a phenyl group attached to a ketone, and the ketone is at position 1 of the ethanone. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is part of a two-carbon chain. So it's Ph-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but maybe in this case, the ketone is at the end. Wait, maybe it's Ph-C(=O)-CH3? Or is it Ph-CH2-C(=O)-something? Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)1-C(=O)-, so it's like R-C(=O)-CH3, where R is the phenyl group. So the structure is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) connected to a ketone (C=O) which is connected to a methyl group. So it's (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)acetone? Like, acetophenone but with substituents on the phenyl ring.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached. Wait, no, the ketone is on the ethane chain attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene with substituents at 3 and 5 positions, and a side chain that is ethan-1-one. Let me think: ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, so the group would be O=C-CH2-Ph? Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1 of ethane, which would be O=C-CH2-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2C=O. Wait, no, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)CO, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's more correct to think of it as a benzene ring with a side chain that's a ketone attached to a methyl group. So, the structure is phenyl-C(=O)-CH3. But wait, that's acetophenone. But in this case, the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, the phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 5 and a bromo at position 3, and the acetophenone group is attached to position 1 of the benzene. So the molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Wait, but how is the acetophenone group attached? Because acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone (COCH3) group. So in this case, the benzene ring has the COCH3 group at position 1, a nitro group at 5, and a bromine at 3. So that's the target molecule.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. So I need to figure out how to introduce these groups in the correct positions.

The substituents are: at position 1, the ketone group (from the ethan-1-one part), position 3 is bromo, and position 5 is nitro. Wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering is important. Let me think: when numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are at 3 and 5, perhaps that's because they are meta to each other? Wait, no, 3 and 5 are adjacent positions if you number in a certain way. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so any numbering depends on where the substituents are.

Wait, perhaps the acetophenone group is at position 1, then nitro at position 5 (which is four positions away in a ring?), or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the order of 3-bromo, 5-nitro, and the ketone is at position 1. Hmm, maybe I should think about the positions in terms of the benzene ring.

Let me think about the directing effects of the substituents. The order of introduction would matter because each substituent will direct the next incoming group to a certain position.

So the substituents we need are:

- Nitro group (strong meta director)
- Bromine (ortho/para director)
- Ketone group (from the acetophenone part, which is a meta director?)

Wait, the acetophenone group is an acyl group attached to benzene. Acetophenone is an aryl ketone. The ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's meta-directing. So when the ketone is attached, any new substituent will go meta to it.

But wait, the acetophenone group is itself a substituent. So when we add other groups, their positions depend on their directing effects and the positions of existing substituents.

So, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:

- COCH3 (acetophenone group at position 1)
- Br at position 3
- NO2 at position 5

Wait, that's impossible because benzene only has six positions. Wait, let me think again. If the acetophenone is at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are around it. So nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So positions 3 and 5 are both meta to position 1. Hmm, but that might not be possible because if the acetophenone is at position 1, and another group is added, say nitro, it would go to position 4 (if it's meta). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the acetophenone isn't the first substituent. Maybe the substituents are introduced in a certain order such that each subsequent group is added in the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps.

We need to have:

- A methyl ketone group (COCH3) attached to the benzene ring.

- Nitro group at position 5.

- Bromine at position 3.

So, how can we introduce these groups in the right order to get the correct substituents.

I think that the order of adding substituents can be crucial, especially considering the directing effects.

Let me outline the possible steps.

First, benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The first substituent will determine where the next substituents go.

If the first substituent is a strong activating group (like -OCH3, -NH2), it will direct meta or para. But since the target has nitro and bromine, which are deactivating, perhaps the first substituent is something that can be introduced with a good leaving group.

Wait, but the target includes nitro and bromine, which are meta directors. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is a nitro group. Wait, but nitration is a strong meta-director. Let me think.

If the first substituent is nitro, then the next substituent would go meta to it. But where?

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added first.

Wait, but nitro is a strong meta director. Let's see: benzene → nitro group. Then, next substituent would be introduced, say bromine. Where would bromine go? Since nitro is meta, the next substituent would enter meta to nitro. So if nitro is at position 1, the bromine would go to position 3. Wait, but then the next substituent would be the ketone.

Hmm, but the acetophenone group's position is dependent on where the other substituents are.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetophenone group is introduced first. Because if we have a ketone group, which is a meta director, then the next substituent (like nitro) would go to the meta position, and the bromine would go to another meta position.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director. So after adding the ketone, if we nitrate, the nitro group would enter meta to the ketone. Then, if we brominate, where would it go?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetophenone group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. So the first step is Friedel-Crafts: benzene + acetyl chloride in presence of AlCl3 to form acetophenone.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, and benzene can undergo this, but if substituents are present, it can affect where the acylium ion attacks.

Wait, but if the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation, then the acetophenone is attached to benzene. Then, the next substituent is introduced.

But wait, acetophenone is a meta director. So any subsequent substituent will enter meta to the ketone.

Suppose after Friedel-Crafts, the next step is nitration. The nitro group will enter meta to the ketone. Then, the third substituent is bromine.

After nitration, the substituents are ketone (say at position 1) and nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would happen where? Since the nitro is a strong meta director, the bromine could enter at position 5, which is meta to nitro. But wait, nitro is at position 3, so meta would be position 6. No, that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps I should number the benzene ring as follows:

Let me imagine the benzene ring with the acetophenone group (COCH3) at position 1. When we nitrate, the nitro group will go meta to that, which would be position 4. Then, when we brominate, the bromine would go meta to the nitro group, which is at 4, so position 1 is already taken. Hmm, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are added in a different order. Maybe the ketone is introduced after the nitro and bromine groups.

Wait, but that's tricky because acetophenone is a meta director, and if we have nitro and bromine as substituents, they may direct incoming groups in specific ways.

Hmm, maybe the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then introduce the ketone.

Wait, let me think. Let's say the first step is nitration. Benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, the next step is bromination. Where would bromine go? Since nitro is a meta director, the bromine would enter meta to nitro, which is position 4. So nitro is at position 1, bromine at 4. Then, the next substituent is the ketone. Where would that go?

Wait, if the ring already has nitro at 1 and bromine at 4, where would the ketone group go? Both nitro and bromine are meta directors. Depending on their positions, the next substituent may have multiple possible positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is the first substituent.

Let me think of another approach. Let's think about the target molecule: the substituents are at positions 3, 5, and 1. Wait, perhaps the ketone is at position 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3.

So how can I get these substituents in the correct positions?

I think the key is to perform the nitration and bromination in such a way that each substituent is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects of the existing groups.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Introduce the ketone group (Friedel-Crafts acylation). But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene can undergo this, but after the acylation, the ring is deactivated. So further electrophilic substitution may not be possible unless we can activate the ring again, which is not usually done.

Wait, that's a problem. Because after Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ring becomes deactivated due to the electron-withdrawing ketone. So adding more substituents via electrophilic substitution would be difficult. So maybe the ketone should be introduced last. Because after the nitration and bromination, the ring may have enough activating groups? Wait, but nitro and bromine are deactivating.

Hmm, this complicates things. So perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then bromine, then introduce the ketone.

But wait, after nitrating and brominating benzene, the ring would have two deactivating groups. Introducing the ketone via Friedel-Crafts might not be possible because the ring is deactivated. So that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different method, such as a nucleophilic substitution or some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the ketone is introduced via a benzyne intermediate or some other method that doesn't require activating the ring. Or perhaps it's added via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced not directly from benzene but via a different intermediate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation after activating the ring. But if the ring is deactivated, that won't work. So maybe the ketone is the first substituent, but then the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult. So perhaps the ketone can't be the first substituent.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about each reaction step in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2

So, steps for option A are:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation (adds COCH3)
2. Bromination (adds Br)
3. Nitration (adds NO2)
4. Reduction with Fe/HCl (maybe reduces nitro to amine)
5. Nitration again? Wait, but after reduction, you have an amine. But then nitrating again? That might not be straightforward.
6. Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)
7. H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent, perhaps for something like a Sandmeyer reaction?)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let's see.

After step i, the compound is acetophenone. But as I thought earlier, the ring is deactivated, so bromination in step ii would not be feasible. So option A may not be correct.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2

So here:

1. Bromination (adds Br)
2. Nitration (adds NO2)
3. Friedel-Crafts acylation (adds COCH3)
4. Nitration again?

Wait, after steps i and ii, the ring has Br and NO2. Both are meta directors. Then, in step iii, attempting Friedel-Crafts would require an activated ring. Benzene with Br and NO2 is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this option is unlikely.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2

So steps:

1. Nitration (adds NO2)
2. Reduction (maybe reduces NO2 to NH2)
3. Friedel-Crafts (adds COCH3)
4. Bromination
5. Nitration again
6. Diazotization
7. H3PO2

Hmm, after step i, we have nitrobenzene. Step ii reduces it to aniline. Then, Friedel-Crafts acylation in step iii adds COCH3. Now, aniline is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur where? The amine directs incoming groups to para and ortho positions. So after acylation, the ring has NH2 and COCH3.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, which aniline provides. So after adding COCH3, the ring has NH2 and COCH3. Then, step iv is bromination. The NH2 is a strong activating group, directing to para and ortho. COCH3 is a meta director. So where would Br go? It depends on the relative directing strengths. The NH2 is more activating, so Br would likely go ortho or para to NH2, which is position 4 or 2, but considering COCH3's position.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose after step ii, we have aniline (NH2 at position 1). Step iii: Friedel-Crafts adds COCH3 at position 4 (para to NH2). Now, the ring has NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 4. Step iv is bromination. NH2 is a strong activating group, so Br would likely go para to NH2, but that's position 4, which is already taken by COCH3. So Br would go ortho to NH2, positions 2 or 6. Then, step v is nitration. The ring has NH2 (strong activating), COCH3 (meta director), and Br. Nitration would be directed by the strongest activator, which is NH2. So nitro would go para to NH2, which is position 4, but that's already taken by COCH3. So maybe it goes meta to NH2, which would be position 3 or 5. If the COCH3 is at 4, then position 3 is adjacent to COCH3. So nitration would go to position 3 or 5.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. I'm not sure if this sequence will yield the correct substituents.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4

So:

1. Nitration (adds NO2)
2. Reduction (maybe NO2 to NH2)
3. Diazotization (makes diazonium salt)
4. H3PO2 (maybe a reduction, like for a Sandmeyer reaction)
5. Bromination
6. Friedel-Crafts acylation
7. Nitration again

Hmm, step i: nitrobenzene. Step ii: reduce to aniline. Step iii: diazotization to make benzene diazonium chloride. Then step iv: H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Wait, what's the role here? Maybe a Sandmeyer reaction, where the diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2 to replace the diazonium group with something else. Wait, H3PO2 is used in the Hock rearrangement or maybe for other reductions.

Alternatively, maybe in this case, the diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2 to replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but that would require a different condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction to form a different group.

Alternatively, maybe step iv is a hydrolysis step, but with H3PO2, which is a mild reducing agent. Not sure. Then step v: bromination. Step vi: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Step vii: nitration again.

This seems a bit convoluted. Let me think about each step.

After step i, nitrobenzene. Step ii: reduced to aniline. Step iii: diazotization. Step iv: H3PO2 might be a reducing agent to convert the diazonium salt into a bromide via Sandmeyer? Or perhaps into a chloride. Wait, but normally, Sandmeyer uses CuCl or CuBr. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used in the presence of iodide ions for substitution. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to produce a phenol. But that would require warm dilute H2SO4, not H3PO2.

Alternatively, maybe step iv is a displacement reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iii (diazonium salt), step iv is treating with H3PO2 to replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence is not leading me to the target molecule.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. The target molecule has a nitro group, a bromine, and a ketone. The ketone is part of an ethanone group attached to the benzene. So, perhaps the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which requires an activated ring. But if the ring has deactivating groups, like nitro or bromine, it won't work. So, perhaps the ketone must be introduced first, before any deactivating substituents.

But wait, after Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult. So, perhaps the nitro and bromine groups are added before the ketone.

Wait, but that would require activating the ring again after adding deactivating groups, which isn't straightforward.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate the benzene, then brominate, then introduce the ketone via a different method, but that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced after the nitro and bromine groups. But then, how, since the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires strong activating groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is introduced via a coupling reaction, but I don't see that as one of the steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the nitration and bromination steps.

Let me think about the target molecule again: the nitro and bromine groups are at meta positions relative to each other and to the ketone.

If the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 5 and bromine at 3. So, when adding substituents, perhaps the nitro and bromine need to be added in a way that they are meta to each other and meta to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the acetophenone group is added first. Then, nitration occurs meta to it, adding nitro at position 4. Then, bromination occurs meta to nitro, which is position 1, but that's already taken by the ketone. Hmm, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, after adding the ketone, nitration and then bromination in positions that are meta to each other and to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then introduce the ketone via some other method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in option C.

Option C steps:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.
2. Reduction → aniline.
3. Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone attached at position 4 (para to NH2).
4. Bromination → where would Br go? Since NH2 is still present, it would direct Br to ortho or para. So, para is position 4 (taken by COCH3), so Br would go ortho, at position 2 or 6. Let's say position 3? No, that's meta to NH2. Wait, NH2 is at position 1. Ortho would be 2 and 6, para is 4. So Br would go to 2 or 6. Let's imagine it goes to position 3, but that's not ortho or para. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the directing wrong.

Wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so any incoming electrophile would go ortho or para to NH2. So, after Friedel-Crafts, which adds COCH3 at para (position 4), the ring has NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 4.

Now, step iv is bromination. The NH2 directs Br to ortho (positions 2 or 6) or para (4, taken). So Br would go to 2 or 6. Let's say position 2.

Then, step v is nitration. The NH2 is still present, directing nitro to ortho (2 or 6) or para (4). Position 2 is taken by Br, position 6 is available. So nitro would go to position 6.

Wait, but the target molecule has nitro at position 5. Hmm, this isn't aligning.

Alternatively, maybe after step iii (Friedel-Crafts), the ring has COCH3 at position 4, and NH2 at 1. Then, bromination (step iv) would add Br at position 2 or 6. Let's say 2. Then, nitration (step v) would add nitro at position 6, which is para to NH2.

So the substituents would be:

NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 4, Br at 2, NO2 at 6.

That's not the target. Target has nitro at 5, Br at 3, and COCH3 at 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Maybe after step iii, COCH3 is added in a different position.

Wait, after step ii, the ring is aniline (NH2 at 1). Then step iii, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds COCH3, which would enter para to NH2, position 4.

Then, step iv, bromination: Br would enter ortho to NH2, position 2 or 6. Let's say position 6.

Then, step v, nitration: since NH2 is at 1, the nitro would go to para (4, taken by COCH3) or ortho (2 or 6, 6 taken by Br). So nitro would go to position 3 or 5. But NH2 is at 1, and nitro is a meta director. Wait, but in the presence of NH2, which is a strong activator, the nitration would be directed by NH2. So, the nitro would go para to NH2 (position 4, taken) or ortho (positions 2 and 6). But both 2 and 6 are possible. Let's say position 3. Wait, but position 3 is meta to NH2, which is a weak director. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But I'm not sure if that would work due to the deactivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then bromide. But again, the order of activation is a problem.

Wait, maybe the bromine is added after the nitro and ketone groups. But that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the bromine, then the ketone is introduced via a different method.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D:

1. Nitration (adds NO2)
2. Reduction (NO2 → NH2)
3. Diazotization (makes diazonium salt)
4. H3PO2 (unknown)
5. Bromination
6. Friedel-Crafts acylation
7. Nitration again.

Hmm, after step 1, nitro at 1. Step 2: reduces to NH2 at 1. Step 3: diazonium salt. Step 4: H3PO2. What's that for? Maybe a Sandmeyer reaction, but without a copper salt, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, it could be a reduction to form a phenol. But H3PO2 is a reducing agent; perhaps it's used to reduce the diazonium salt to an amine again. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, step iv could be a substitution reaction. For example, in the presence of H3PO2, the diazonium salt could undergo substitution with a bromide, replacing the amino group with a bromine. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe step iv is a hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to phenols under certain conditions. But H3PO2 is more of a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a periodate cleavage, but that's for vicinal diols.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not relevant to the substitution but is part of another process. 

After step iv, step v is bromination. If step iv introduced a bromine, then step v would add another Br, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps this option isn't the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the correct order of substituent introduction. The target has nitro at 5, bromo at 3, and ketone at 1.

Wait, if the ketone is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3.

So, the positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So, positions 1,3,5 are all substituted.

Wait, benzene has six positions, so those substituents are at 1,3,5, which are all meta to each other.

So, the substituents form a meta pattern, each at 120 degrees apart.

Now, how can that happen?

Perhaps, the first substituent is nitro. Then, the next is bromine, which is added meta to nitro. Then, the ketone is added meta to bromine and nitro.

But how to get all three substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, but the ketone can't be added via Friedel-Crafts if the ring is deactivated by nitro and bromine.

So, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different method, such as a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced after the ketone and nitro groups. Wait, but again, the ring would be deactivated.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking back, option C's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation, which adds COCH3 para to NH2 (position 4).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, which would add Br at ortho to NH2 (positions 2 or 6).

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, which with NH2 present would add nitro at position 6 (para to NH2, since position 4 is taken).

Wait, but that would give nitro at 6, NH2 at 1, COCH3 at 4, Br at 2 or 6.

Hmm, that's not matching the target.

Alternatively, maybe after step iii, the ring has NH2 at 1 and COCH3 at 4. Then, step iv bromination adds Br at position 2. Then, step v, nitration adds nitro at position 6.

So substituents are 1 (NH2), 4 (COCH3), 2 (Br), 6 (NO2). That's four substituents, but the target only has three, so perhaps some steps are wrong.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first brominate, then nitrate, then acylate.

Looking at option B: steps are Br2, then nitration, then acylation.

But after Br and NO2 are added, the ring is deactivated, so acylation via Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is introduced not via Friedel-Crafts but via some other method, such as a substitution after a leaving group is introduced. For example, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group on the ring, which isn't common.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's not part of the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the correct order of groups and how they can be added.

Wait, the target has the ketone at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So, perhaps the ketone is added first, then nitro at position 5 (meta to ketone), then bromine at position 3 (meta to nitro and also meta to ketone? Wait, but if nitro is at 5, meta would be position 8, which doesn't exist. Hmm, benzene has only six positions.)

Wait, perhaps the ketone is at position 1. Nitro is then added at position 3 (meta to ketone). Then, bromine is added at position 5 (meta to nitro and para to ketone).

Wait, but after adding nitro at 3, the bromine would go meta to nitro, which is position 6. But position 5 is para to position 1 (ketone), so if the ketone is activating, the bromine would be directed differently.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a reaction sequence that allows the ketone to be added after nitro and bromine. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro and bromine are introduced in such a way that their positions are meta to each other and meta to the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the ketone, then the bromine.

But after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, so adding the ketone via Friedel-Crafts is impossible. So that won't work.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is added via a different method, such as via a Grignard reagent, but that's not part of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, let me re-examine option C.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts; since NH2 is activating, COCH3 is added para to NH2 (position 4).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate; NH2 directs to ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (4, taken). So Br adds to position 2 or 6. Let's say position 2.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration; NH2 is still present, so nitro would go para to NH2 (position 4, taken) or ortho (positions 2 and 6). Position 6 is available, so nitro adds to position 6.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 1: NH2

Position 4: COCH3

Position 2: Br

Position 6: NO2

But the target has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So this doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option A, but I'm unsure.

Option A steps:

i) COCH3 via Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone.

But then, the ring is deactivated. So step ii: Br2/FeBr3 won't work. So this can't be correct.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, and the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, unless the ketone is introduced via a different method, like a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a benzyne intermediate, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the order in which the substituents are added, considering that the ketone is meta-directing. So, if I can get nitro and bromine to be added in positions that are meta to each other and meta to the ketone, that would work.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the bromine, then the nitro group, then the ketone. But again, the ketone would require an activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different reaction, like a benzoin condensation, but that's not part of the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about the positions.

Let me try numbering the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1, nitro at 5, bromine at 3.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

Now, to achieve this, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Nitro is at position 1.

Then, bromine is added at position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, the ketone is added at position 5 (meta to bromine and nitro). But after nitro and bromine are added, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added first via Friedel-Crafts, then nitro and bromine are added.

But after the ketone is added, the ring is deactivated, so nitration and bromination won't proceed via electrophilic substitution.

So, that leaves me wondering if any of the options can achieve the desired product.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D steps:

1. Nitrate → nitro at 1.

2. Reduce → NH2 at 1.

3. Diazotize → benzene diazonium chloride.

4. H3PO2 → maybe replaces NH2 with something else. Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Maybe it reduces the diazonium salt to a phenol? But that would require acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's used in a substitution reaction, replacing the amino group with a bromide.

Wait, in the presence of H3PO2, perhaps the diazonium salt undergoes a substitution with a bromide ion, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used in a periodate cleavage, but that's for cleaving vicinal diols.

Wait, another thought: H3PO2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for reducing aromatic rings, which isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a hydrolysis, converting the diazonium salt to a phenol. That would leave a hydroxyl group at position 1.

Then, step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But with a hydroxyl group (which is a strong activating group), bromine would enter ortho or para to OH. So, if OH is at position 1, Br would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step vi: Friedel-Crafts acylation → adds COCH3 at position 4 (para to OH), but position 4 is already taken by Br. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to work.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv doesn't produce a phenol but another substituent.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for the correct order in which each substituent is added, considering their directing effects.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce the ketone via Friedel-Crafts (activated ring).

2. Nitrate the ring (meta to ketone → position 5).

3. Brominate the ring (meta to nitro → position 3).

But after step 1, the ring is deactivated, so steps 2 and 3 won't proceed.

So, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the nitro group and bromine in such a way that the ketone can be added via a different method. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, because after steps i to v, the nitro group is in position 5, bromine in 3, and the ketone in 1. But how?

Option C steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adds COCH3 at 4.

iv) Bromination → adds Br at 2.

v) Nitration → adds nitro at 6.

So the substituents are at 1 (NH2), 4 (COCH3), 2 (Br), 6 (NO2). That's four substituents, which is more than the target.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different position. Let me think again about option C.

After step iii, COCH3 is at 4. Step iv, bromination adds Br at 2. Step v, nitration adds nitro at 6. Then, step vi is NaNO2/HCl → makes diazonium salt at position 6 (NO2). Then, step vii: H3PO2 → perhaps reduction to NH2? But then, does that help?

Wait, after step v, the ring has NO2 at 6, Br at 2, COCH3 at 4, and NH2 at 1. Then, step vi is diazotization, which would convert the nitro group at 6 into a diazonium salt. Then, step vii: H3PO2. What could that do? Maybe a Sandmeyer reaction to replace the diazonium group with Br or Cl.

But without a copper catalyst, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group at 6 is reduced to NH2, but I'm not certain.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider the correct order of substituent addition as nitro, bromine, then ketone via a different method. But I can't see how.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is option C, even though my analysis is unclear.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has nitro and bromine substituents that are meta to each other and meta to the ketone. So, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then bromine. But after nitro, the ring is deactivated, so ketone can't be added via Friedel-Crafts.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added via a different method, such as a substitution after nitro and bromine are added. But I don't see such a step in the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options given.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group (NO2) at position 5. The positions of these substituents suggest a meta-directing pattern, where each substituent is meta to the others. The key challenge is determining the correct sequence of reactions to introduce these groups in the correct positions while considering the directing effects of the substituents and the activation/deactivation of the benzene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group (COCH3) at position 1.
2. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination occurs. However, after Friedel-Crafts acylation, the benzene ring is deactivated, making further electrophilic substitution (e.g., bromination) difficult or unlikely.
3. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration occurs. Again, the deactivated ring hinders this step.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of a nitro group to an amine (if present).
5. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration again.
6. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of an amine.
7. **H3PO2**: Reduction of a diazonium salt or other transformations.

This sequence is unlikely to succeed because the ring is deactivated after the initial Friedel-Crafts acylation, preventing subsequent electrophilic substitutions.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination introduces a bromine atom.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces a nitro group.
3. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group.

After bromination and nitration, the benzene ring is deactivated due to the presence of the deactivating bromine and nitro groups. Friedel-Crafts acylation, which requires an activated ring, is unlikely to proceed successfully in this sequence.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces a nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
3. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group (COCH3) para to the amine group.
4. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination introduces a bromine atom ortho or para to the amine group.
5. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces another nitro group.
6. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of an amine.
7. **H3PO2**: Reduction of a diazonium salt or other transformations.

This sequence introduces multiple substituents, but the positions of the nitro, bromine, and ketone groups do not align with the target molecule. The final product would have additional substituents or incorrect positioning.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces a nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
3. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.
4. **H3PO2**: Reduction of the diazonium salt (possibly introducing a bromine or hydroxyl group).
5. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination introduces a bromine atom.
6. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group.
7. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces another nitro group.

This sequence is overly complex and does not clearly lead to the desired product. The positions of the substituents would not align with the target molecule.

---

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible sequence, despite some uncertainties in the exact positioning of the substituents. It introduces the nitro group, reduces it to an amine, and then adds the ketone group via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Subsequent bromination and nitration steps may refine the positions to match the target molecule.

**Answer: C**
