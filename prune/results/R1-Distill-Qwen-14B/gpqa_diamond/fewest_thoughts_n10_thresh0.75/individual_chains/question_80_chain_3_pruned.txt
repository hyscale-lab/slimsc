Alright, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that processes some input strings and gives certain outputs. My job is to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to a new input, "ACAGTGACC", to find out which option is correct.

Okay, let's start by looking at the examples given. The first input is "AGG" which outputs 115. The second example is "TGCTGA" giving 176. I need to find a pattern or a rule that transforms these strings into numbers.

Hmm, maybe it's something to do with the individual letters. Let's think about the letters as their positions in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, C is 3, T is 20, etc. Let me write that down.

First example: AGG.
A is 1, G is 7, G is 7. So the numbers are 1,7,7.
What can I do with these? Maybe add them up. 1 +7 +7 =15. But the output is 115, which is way higher. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a base conversion. Like treating the string as a number in a certain base. For example, in base 10, each digit is 0-9, but if each letter represents a digit, maybe it's a different base.

Wait, but what's the base here? Let's see. The letters are A, G, C, T. So four letters. Hmm, but wait, in the examples, the inputs are AGG and TGCTGA. Let me list all the letters present: A, G, C, T. Wait, that's four letters. So perhaps the base is 4. But that might not make sense because base 4 digits go from 0 to 3, but our letters are A=1, G=7, C=3, T=20. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps each letter is converted to a number, and then each number is multiplied by a position factor. Or perhaps each letter's value is summed in a certain way.

Let me think again about the first example: AGG → 115.

Letters: A (1), G (7), G (7). Maybe 1* something +7* something +7* something. Let's see. 115 is the total. So 115 = 1 * x +7 * y +7 * y. Maybe the same for the second example.

Second example: TGCTGA → 176.

Letters: T (20), G (7), C (3), T (20), G (7), A (1). So 20,7,3,20,7,1.

Hmm. Let me try adding all the letter values for each example.

First example: 1 +7 +7 =15. But output is 115. Hmm, 15 *7.666? Not sure. Alternatively, 15 *7 =105, which is lower than 115. That doesn't help.

Wait, maybe it's considering the letters as
