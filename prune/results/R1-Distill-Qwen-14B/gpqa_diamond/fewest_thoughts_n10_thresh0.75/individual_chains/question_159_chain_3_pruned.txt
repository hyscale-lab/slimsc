Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths than that. I remember that in quasars, the emission lines can be broad and there's something called the Lyman-alpha forest, which is related to absorption lines from hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. Oh wait, but the peak here is in the infrared. Lyman-alpha is in the UV, so maybe this isn't directly about that.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The options are all in gigaparsecs, so this must be a high-redshift object. Comoving distance relates to how far away an object is at a given scale factor, considering the expansion of the universe.

The universe parameters given are the Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy Ωλ = 0.7, and it's flat (so Ωk=0). These are standard parameters for a Lambda-CDM model.

I think the key here is the peak wavelength. When you observe a peak in the spectrum, the observed wavelength can be related to the emitted wavelength via redshift. The emitted wavelength would be in the rest frame of the quasar. If the peak is at 790 nm, but when the quasar emitted it, it was in
