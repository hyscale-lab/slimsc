Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of esters, maybe? Or wait, no, waitâ€”red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Hmm, no, wait again. Oh right, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, when nitriles react with H2O and HgSO4 (like acid-catalyzed hydration), they form ketones. Alternatively, when they are treated with HI and red phosphorus, I think that's for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or maybe it's for converting nitriles to something else, like imidates? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be used for the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, no, I think esters usually hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, but in another context: I remember that esters can be converted into alcohols using LiAlH4 or other strong reducing agents. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

But wait, in this problem, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Oh! Red phosphorus and HI
