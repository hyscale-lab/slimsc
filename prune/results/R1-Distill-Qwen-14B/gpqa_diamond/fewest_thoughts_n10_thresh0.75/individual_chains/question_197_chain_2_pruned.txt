Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided are IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So if the compound has a ketone group, that reaction would reduce it.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggest there might be an O-H stretch, but wait, that region is also for alcohols or maybe alkenes? Or maybe it's an acidic proton like a carbonyl. Wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1â€”that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so there's probably an aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR: Let's look at each peak.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift. For an aromatic compound, that could be a proton adjacent to substituents, but more likely, it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids are usually broad around 10-12 ppm. The broad singlet (bs) suggests maybe a carboxylic acid -OH proton. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde group.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but in DMSO they might be higher. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton. But 10.5 is more likely an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But since the IR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, but in the NMR, if there was a ketone, there wouldn't be an aldehyde proton. Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the IR also has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. For a ketone, the C=O stretch is around 1715 cm-1, so 1720 is in that range. For a carboxylic acid, it's usually broader and a bit lower, maybe around 1700 but sometimes higher. Wait, but if the compound is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else. Wait, maybe a vinyl proton? No, aromatic protons are usually lower. Or maybe another functional group.

Wait, the NMR also shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 next to another group. The 2.9 ppm (m,
