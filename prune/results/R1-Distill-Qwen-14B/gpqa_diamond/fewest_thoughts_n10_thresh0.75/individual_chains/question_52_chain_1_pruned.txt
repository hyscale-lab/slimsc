Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how dark spots affect certain ratios in the photosphere. I remember that stars can have spots which are cooler regions, right? And when those spots are present, they can influence the overall temperature measurements and maybe other properties like the emission lines we observe.

The question says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But how does that come into play here?

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 (or whatever) depends on the temperature. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's hotter (6000 K). Because, according to the Boltzmann equation, as temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, which affects the ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The ratio is n1/n2. Let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. So E_i is lower than E_j. Then E_i - E_j is negative. So the exponential becomes exp( -(negative) / k T ) = exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponent (E_j - E_i)/(k T) increases, because the denominator is smaller. So the exponential would get larger, meaning n1/n2 ratio increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe the levels are opposite. Maybe the transition is from a higher level to a lower one, so when you look at the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 (higher energy) to level 1 (lower), that would be n2/n1. Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So the question is about n1/n2.

Wait, let's clarify. The question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K). If the ratio n1/n2 when T is lower is less than when T is higher, that must mean that n1/n2 is lower at lower T. So for n1/n2 to be lower at lower T, the ratio would be inversely related to T.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, because the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i is level 1 and E_j is level 2, then if E1 < E2, then E_i - E_j is negative. So the exponent becomes -(negative) = positive. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes smaller, so exp(...) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, that doesn't fit with the problem statement. Because when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the equation, n1/n2 increases as T decreases, because (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger when T is smaller, so the exponential is larger.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again. Suppose E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2
