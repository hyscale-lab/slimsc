Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is like the apparent shift of a star's position as the Earth moves around the Sun, right? So the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Oh wait, no, actually, I think it's distance in parsecs equals 1 divided by parallax. So d = 1/plx. Yeah, that makes sense because the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax range. So, if we have a range of parallax values, like from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range change with plx? The options are all inverse power laws of plx.

Wait, I think this relates to the volume of space. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume depends on how much volume there is at a certain distance. But since we're looking at parallax, which is inversely related to distance, maybe we need to translate this into terms of volume.

So, let's model this as a sphere. At a certain distance d, the volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)πd³. So the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) between d and
