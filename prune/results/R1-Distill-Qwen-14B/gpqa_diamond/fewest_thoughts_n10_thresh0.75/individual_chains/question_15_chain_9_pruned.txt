Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet the researchers should observe for transits. Both are Earth-like, detected via the RV method, same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties.

Hmm, so the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's (R_s / a), not squared? Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both have circular orbits, e=0, so it's just (R_s / a). But wait, actually, I'm not sure. I think the geometric probability is (R_*/a), where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability increases when the star is larger relative to the planet's distance.

Wait, but if the star is larger, that would mean a higher probability. Because a larger star relative to the planet's orbit makes it more likely that the planet's path passes in front. Alternatively, if a is smaller, the probability is higher. So the probability is proportional to R*/a.

But wait, in this problem, both host stars have the same radii. So R_s for both is the same. So the probability is inversely proportional to a, the semi-major axis. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but the orbital period is given. The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = 3 * P2. But using Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the host star. Since the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, let's denote M1 = 2*M2.

So for Planet_1: P1² = (4π²/G M1) * a1³.

Similarly for Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/G M2) * a2³.

Given P1 = P2 /3 (since Planet_1's period is three times shorter), so P1 = (1/3) P2.

Let me set up the two equations.

( P1² ) / ( P2² ) = ( ( ( a1³ ) / ( M1 ) ) ) / ( ( a2³ ) / ( M2 ) ) )

Substituting P1 = P2/3:

( (P2² / 9) ) / P2² = ( a1³ / M1 ) / ( a2³ / M2 )

Simplifies to 1/9 = (a1³ * M2 ) / (a2³ * M1 )

Because M1 is 2*M2, so M2 = M1 /2.

Substituting M2 = M1/2:

1/9 = (a1³ * (M1/2) ) / (a2³ * M1 )

The M1 cancels out
