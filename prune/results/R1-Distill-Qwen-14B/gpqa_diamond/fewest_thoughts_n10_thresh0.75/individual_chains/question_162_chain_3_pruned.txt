Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the metric given is in the form of ds². The question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which I think is a concept from general relativity or differential geometry. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature.

The metric provided is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator is 4 - x² - y². So, the region where this metric is defined must exclude points where the denominator becomes zero or negative because the metric would blow up or become imaginary there. So, 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, this is a 2-dimensional metric, so perhaps it's describing a surface embedded in higher dimensions? Or maybe it's a 2D space with some curvature.

I think the metric might be in polar coordinates. Let me think: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes (4 - r²). The metric then would be ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, because dx² + dy² in polar becomes dr² + r² dθ². So, that's the metric.

Now,
