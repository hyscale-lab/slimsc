Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh right, the question is about a pseudosphere, which I remember is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, kind of like a saddle shape but with a constant negative curvature.

Wait, but what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think the area of a sphere in regular geometry is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, in hyperbolic space, the area element might be calculated differently.

Looking at the metric, I see it's a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). That suggests it's conformally flat, meaning it can be written as a scaling of the flat Euclidean metric. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dxdy. But wait, since it's a diagonal metric, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal components. So the metric tensor components are [32/(4 - x² - y²)] for dx² and the same for dy². So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², I think.
