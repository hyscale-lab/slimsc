Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx. The particle is in a specific superposition state. Hmm, expectation values... right, they involve the average outcome of a measurement if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. Oh, right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So for operator O = aA + bB, the expectation is a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩. So I can separate this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩.

Let's start with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz is calculated as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the state is ψ = c_up |↑⟩ + c_down |↓⟩, where c_up is 0.5 and c_down is sqrt(3)/2. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? Because σz|↑⟩ = +|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ is |c_up|^2 * (+1) + |c_down|^2 * (-1). Plugging in the values:

|c_up|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.

|c_down|^2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the more challenging part is σx. The operator σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, the expectation value can be found using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = ( |c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2 ) * something? Wait, no, I think I need to compute it using the components.

Wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the operator σx swaps the states. The expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let's compute that. So, let me write ψ as a vector. Let me denote |↑⟩ as the first basis vector (top) and |↓⟩ as the second (bottom). So, ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can calculate ψ† σx ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Since all coefficients here are real, ψ† is just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step. First, multiply σx by ψ.

σx ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T. Wait, no, matrix multiplication: σx is 2x2, ψ is 2x1.

Wait, let me compute σx * ψ:

The first component is (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

The second component is (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5.

So σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ
