Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question is asking about the number of stars per unit plx range. So, if I imagine a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, how does the count of stars in that range change with plx?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so their number should depend on how much volume there is at a given distance. Because as you look further away, the volume increases, so more stars would be in a certain range, but wait, no, because the number of stars per unit volume is uniform here.

Let me think about this. The parallax plx is related to distance d by the formula plx = 1/d (but in parsecs, I think). So, plx is 1/d where d is in parsecs. So, d = 1/plx. 

Now, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform density of stars. So star count N is proportional to d² dd. 

But wait, the problem is about the number per unit plx. Hmm. So, since plx is 1/d, let's see: express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. 

The volume element, which is dV = 4πd² dd. Let's substitute d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance. But we need to express this in terms of plx.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars per unit plx. So, for a given parallax plx, the number of stars in a range dplx would be N = n * (number of stars per volume) * (volume between plx and plx + dplx) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think step by step.

The number of stars in a small volume element would be proportional to dV. But dV is 4πd² dd. But how does dd relate
