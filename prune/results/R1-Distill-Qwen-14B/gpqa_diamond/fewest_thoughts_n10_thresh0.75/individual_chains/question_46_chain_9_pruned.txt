Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So the catalyst helps in the redistribution of alkylidene groups.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, but since the molecule is chiral, each enantiomer would have the same structure but opposite configurations. But wait, does the starting molecule have a chiral center? Let's draw its structure.

3-Methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's 1-pentene. Wait, no. Oh wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂? Wait, no, maybe I should draw it correctly.

Wait, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂? No, wait, the chain is five carbons. So pent-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, which is C3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let's count: 1 2 3 4 5. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is on C3.

So structure: CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, but that can't be right because the chain would be five carbons, so maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, pentene is five carbons. 1-ene means double bond between C1 and
