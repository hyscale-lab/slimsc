Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, it's a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

Wait, the compound in question is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Pentene has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So pent-1-ene: CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So that's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, wait. Let's count the carbons. The parent chain is pentene, so five carbons. Position 1 is the double bond, so pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. If it's 3-methyl, then
