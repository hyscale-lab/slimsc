Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group â€” that's a CH2OH. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an allyl group, right? So it's like CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So, it's an isopropenyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

So the structure looks like a cyclohexanone with substituents at C3 (CH2OH) and C5 (CH2C(CH3)=CH2?), wait no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)= something? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, let me think of it as substituent groups. The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. So the group is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2? No. Wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl. The numbering starts from the point of attachment. So
