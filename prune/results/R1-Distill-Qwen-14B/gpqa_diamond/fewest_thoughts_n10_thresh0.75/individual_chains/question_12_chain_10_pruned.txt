Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. Pi mesons, or pions, are subatomic particles, and this is a decay process. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, conservation laws are really important here—specifically conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny (almost zero) mass and are hard to detect, but in equations, I guess I can treat their mass as negligible compared to the others.

So the problem gives me the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is not given. Oh, right! For neutrinos, in many cases, especially in beta decay, we assume they're massless. Or maybe in this problem, the neutrino's mass is considered zero. That would simplify things.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. I think in particle physics, sometimes the rest mass of neutrinos is neglected. So perhaps I can treat it as m_nu ≈ 0. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since Pi+ is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is zero, so its momentum is p_nu = E_nu / c, since E² = (pc)^2 + m² c^4, and m=0. So E_nu = pc. Similarly, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 ? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units where c=1 to simplify. Since we're dealing in MeV and such, energy and mass have compatible units.

Let me set c=1 for simplicity. So energy-momentum relation is E² = p² + m². So the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu^2). The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu. But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), because they're opposite in direction, so p_nu = p_mu. Wait no, because they have opposite momenta, so p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, I think in terms of magnitude, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum (since p_nu's magnitude is the same). Then, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 +
