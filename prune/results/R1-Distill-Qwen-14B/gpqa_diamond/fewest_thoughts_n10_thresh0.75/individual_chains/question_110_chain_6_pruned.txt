Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. The question gives some details about each star, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments.

First, let me read the question again. The key point is that each spectrograph can observe stars up to a certain apparent V magnitude. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag (so apparent V less than or equal to 17) can be seen by ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag (apparent V magnitude less than 17), it's observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent V <=16?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The question says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, it's observable. So the limit is 17: anything with V <17 is okay for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, the limit is 16: anything with V <16 is observable.

So, to be detected by both, the star must have apparent V magnitude <=16 (so that HIRES can see it), because if it's more than 17, ESPRESSO can't. Wait, no: wait, no, wait. Wait, if a star is 17 mag, is it brighter than 17? No, 17 is exactly the limit. So ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, meaning up to 17
