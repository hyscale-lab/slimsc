Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. The eigenvalues are the possible results of that measurement.

The problem states that the operator is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. And I'm supposed to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the direction is determined by some angles theta and phi, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi must be zero or 180 degrees? Or wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle phi is the angle around the z-axis. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi is zero or pi? Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal) is zero, meaning it's along the positive x direction, or pi, along the negative x. But the problem says arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of an angle theta from the z-axis, and phi =0, but it's arbitrary. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to get into that right now.

The operator P is along direction n, so the operator in question is P·n. So the operator is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Each of the components P_x, P_y, P_z is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So let's write each of them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P_n would be:

P_n = n_x (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_y
