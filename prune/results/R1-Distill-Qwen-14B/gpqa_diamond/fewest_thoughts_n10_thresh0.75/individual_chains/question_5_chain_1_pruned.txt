Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along some direction n in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvectors that are related to the eigenstates of spin along a particular axis.

Wait, muons are similar to electrons in terms of spin, so their spin-1/2 system applies here. The operator in question is probably the spin operator, S, which is similar to P here. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, but wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so it's P|ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait no, wait. The operator is given as P, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each scaled by ħ/2. So the operator vector P is like (P_x, P_y, P_z). So the magnitude of the operator would be the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. But wait, for an arbitrary direction n, the operator along that direction would be P · n hat, right?

So the operator in the direction of n is P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), wait no, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) no, wait, no. Wait, actually, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have only x and z components, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because θ is measured from the z-axis. Oh right, because if θ is 0
