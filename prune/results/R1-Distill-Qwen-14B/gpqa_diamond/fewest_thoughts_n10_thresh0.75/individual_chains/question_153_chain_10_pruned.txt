Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. And the product is usually a conjugate addition product, which is stabilized by resonance.

The question has three parts, each a different Michael addition, and I need to find the major products (A, B, C) from each. Then match them with the options given.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH.

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? I think it's (CH3CO)2CH2, or CH2(COOEt)2. It's a good nucleophile because the enolate can form easily. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, E-configuration. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, and the substituents on either end are a p-tolyl group and a COOCH3 group, right? Since it's E, the higher priority groups are on opposite sides. But for the Michael reaction, the configuration might not matter as much as the positions.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the β position of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, let me think. The enolate of dimethyl malonate would be something like CH2(COOEt)COOEt with a negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the β position (the CH2 part of the acrylate), the attack would add the malonate part to the acrylate.

So the acrylate is CH2-C=C-OAc (but wait, the structure is different). Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, no, wait. Structure: The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents are arranged such that the p-tolyl is on the double bond. Wait, actually, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl on carbon 3. So structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, but that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHCO-p-tolyl, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3 position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, wait. The correct IUPAC name would help. (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. But acrylate only has three carbons: the double bond is between 1 and 2, then 3 is the ester. So the third carbon is the COOCH3. So putting the p-tolyl on the third carbon might not make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting
