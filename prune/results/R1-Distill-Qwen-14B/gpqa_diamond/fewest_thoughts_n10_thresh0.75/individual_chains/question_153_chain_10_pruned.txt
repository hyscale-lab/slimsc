Alright, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Okay, so the question gives three different reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each. Let's take them one by one and see if I can work through them.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition entails. The Michael donor (a nucleophile, usually an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor), forming a new carbon-carbon bond and creating a new carbonyl group. The product is a conjugate addition product.

Now, the first part is reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor, I think. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which can form an enolate under basic conditions. The base (NaOEt) would deprotonate the alpha position of dimethyl malonate, creating an enolate ion. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but as an acrylate ester. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=O, but I'm not sure. Wait, the structure of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is between the two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of this acrylate.

Let me think about the structure. Dimethyl malonate is (CH2COOEt)2. When it forms the enolate, it loses a proton from one of the alpha positions (the CH2 next to the carbonyl). The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. Then, this enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate will attack the CH2, so the addition would be to the middle carbon in the CH2=CH group. So the product would have a new bond formed between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

After the attack, the double bond would shift to maintain the conjugation. So the product would have a new single bond where the double bond was, and a new double bond would form between the carbonyl and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, let's draw this out. The acrylate is:

O

O=C-OCH3

CH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be:

CH2=CH-p-tolyl with an ester group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-C
