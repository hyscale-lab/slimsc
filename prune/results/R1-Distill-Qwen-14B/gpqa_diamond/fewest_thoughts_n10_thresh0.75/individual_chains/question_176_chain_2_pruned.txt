Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in a specific order. Let's see what the problem says.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So I probably need to normalize this vector first.

The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I wonder what the eigenvalues of this matrix are because measuring an observable involves projecting the state onto the eigenstates of the operator.

The operator Q is another 3x3 matrix. Its first row is (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1). So this looks diagonal, which makes things easier. The eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for a diagonal matrix.

The problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, wait, no—the question says measure Q just after P. Oh wait, no: the sequence is P is measured first, then Q. Or wait, no, the wording is "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the sequence is P first, then Q.

But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So measuring P first would collapse the system into an eigenstate of P, then measuring Q on that resulting state.

So I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then measuring Q on that resulting state gives -1.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then from that state, calculate the probability of Q being -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is that P is measured first, and then Q. So the state after P measurement is an eigenstate of P, which is then used for measuring Q.

But wait, another thought: since Q's matrix is diagonal, its eigenstates are the basis vectors. So maybe it's easier to work in the eigenbasis of Q when dealing with Q measurements.

But let's approach this step by step.

First, I think I need to normalize the initial state. The initial state is a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). So the state vector is:

ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6),
