Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about measuring observables P and Q in a given state, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring P first, then Q. 

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Oh, right, but in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a unit vector. I should check if this is normalized. Let me calculate the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not a unit vector. Hmm, maybe I need to normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the state being normalized. So the actual state vector would be the given vector divided by the square root of 6. So each component is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The operator P is given as a matrix. Let me write it out:

P matrix:
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

And Q's matrix is:
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

The problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1 when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, but after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then, measuring Q would be on that new state.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the system collapses to an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. So the first step is to find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0.

Let me write down the matrix P. Hmm, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me set up the equation (P - 0*I) v = 0, so P v = 0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 â†’ v2 = 0
Row 2:
