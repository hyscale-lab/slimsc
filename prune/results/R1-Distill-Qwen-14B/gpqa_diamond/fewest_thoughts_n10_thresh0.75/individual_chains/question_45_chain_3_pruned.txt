Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies. The particles are identical and spin-1/2, which probably means they're fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so each quantum state can hold only one particle, and the particles must have unique quantum numbers.

The well has length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), but it's stated that E = π² ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is just n² E, right? Because E_1 = E, E_2 = (2²)E =4E, E_3=9E, etc.

Wait, but wait. The problem says four particles. Since they are spin-1/2, each particle can have two possible spin states (up and down). So each spatial state can hold two particles. But wait, in the ground state, how are the particles filled?

In a one-dimensional box, each particle has a quantum number n. For identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. But in 1D, the quantum numbers are just n and spin. So each n can have up to 2 particles (since spin can be up or down for each).

So the ground state would be the lowest energy arrangement. Let's think about filling the states. The first state (n=1) can have 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold 2 particles (n=2, spin up and down). Wait, but wait, with four particles, that would take n=1 and n=2 each filled with 2 particles each. So the ground state would have all four particles filled into the two lowest energy levels.

Wait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first four particles would fill up the lowest available levels. Let me think: each n can hold two particles, so the first two n's can hold four particles.

Wait, the energy levels for each n are E_n =n² E. So ground state would be when the particles are in the lowest possible n's.

So for four particles, the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles. So the total energy would be (2 particles × E_1) + (2 particles × E_2) = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E? Hmm, but wait, that would make the total energy 10E. But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E, and there are two particles there (spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 has two particles, each contributing 4E. So total energy would be 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

Wait, but wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. So four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles
