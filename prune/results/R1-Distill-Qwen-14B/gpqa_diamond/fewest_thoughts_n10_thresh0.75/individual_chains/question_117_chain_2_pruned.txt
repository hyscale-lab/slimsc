Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are mirror images of each other and can't be superimposed. These are also called enantiomers, right? So, the key here is to figure out which of the given compounds can have such isomers.

The question gives four compounds, numbered 1 to 4. I need to go through each one and determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.

Starting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings can have substituents in positions that might allow for stereoisomerism. Since it's a biphenyl, the two phenyl groups are connected at the 1 position. The substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. Wait, the nitro groups are at the 6 positions, and the carboxylate groups are at 2. So, the structure is symmetrical? Because the substituents on each ring are in positions that are across from each other, maybe. But wait, if the two rings are connected at position 1, and the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring, would that create a possibility for the rings to rotate and cause different spatial arrangements?

Wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or some form of asymmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So, looking at this compound, is there a plane of symmetry?

The substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the molecule has a mirror plane between the two rings, would that prevent optical isomerism? Or, maybe because the substituents are in positions that allow for the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the two nitro groups in symmetrical positions doesn't allow for a chiral center. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a center of chirality. For that, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry. Biphenyls can sometimes lead to such situations depending on substituents. 

I think that if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have enantiomers. For example, in the biphenyl, if substituents are not arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be chiral. So in this case, the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'—so each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Each ring is symmetrical? Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, so each is a meta arrangement. But the arrangement across the two rings—since they're connected at position 1, the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions. So, is there a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, with a plane through the central bond. If that's the case,
