Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. So, the question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I'll take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, I think it's a substitution reaction.

In the case of ketones reacting with CN- (which comes from NaCN), I remember that the nitrile group substitutes the carbonyl oxygen. Oh wait, but how does that happen exactly? I think the mechanism involves the formation of an enol or something. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, which facilitates the attack. So maybe reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ because it's a strong proton source.

So the first reaction is a ketone undergoing nucleophilic acyl substitution. But wait, what about the product? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. No, wait, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you substitute the O with CN, you get (CH
