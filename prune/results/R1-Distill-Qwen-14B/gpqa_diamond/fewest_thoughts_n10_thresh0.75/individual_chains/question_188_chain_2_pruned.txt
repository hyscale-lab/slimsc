Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, rhombohedral is one of the crystal systems. I remember that in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—oh, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms?

Wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. In a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell has vectors a, b, c, all of the same length, and the angles between them are all equal. So I think the lattice constant a is the interatomic distance here. So a = 10 Angstroms. And each angle is 30 degrees.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, interplanar distance refers to the d-spacing, right? The distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for d-spacing in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law equation, but more directly, I think it's calculated using the formula for the reciprocal lattice.

The general formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l
