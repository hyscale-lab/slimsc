Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, so first, I need to understand what the operator P looks like. Oh right, the operator is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices. For P_x, it's (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. That matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which I recognize as the Pauli X matrix, right? So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the diagonal matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]], so that's the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be expressed in spherical coordinates maybe. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 because it's in the x-z plane (so no y-component). Wait, but maybe the question allows φ to be arbitrary? Or is n in the x-z plane, so φ is zero? Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, the unit vector n can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane means that the direction has components in x and z, but not y. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, for any point in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, but in general, the direction can be any angle θ around the z-axis, but since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the problem allows for any direction, but lying in
