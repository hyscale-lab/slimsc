Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see if I can figure this out.

So the question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, which I remember measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The shift in the spectral lines is given for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(0.5))) )^(1/3) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*^(2/3)) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But wait, since the stars are more massive than the planets, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term goes away. So the formula simplifies.

So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But wait, wait, I think the exact formula is K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no. Let's think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me look for a simpler relationship. I remember that for the same star mass and planet mass, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, because K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, but in this case, both stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like, so same M_p). So the only variables here are the shifts, which relate to K. So the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity. Let me think: the Doppler shift (in velocity
