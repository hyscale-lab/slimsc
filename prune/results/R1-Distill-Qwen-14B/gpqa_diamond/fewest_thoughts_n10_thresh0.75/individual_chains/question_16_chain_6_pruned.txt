Okay, so I have this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what I remember. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that's due to having chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry in the molecule. So, the first thing I think I should do is look at each compound and figure out if it has any chiral centers, and if those centers are actually causing the molecule to be chiral.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is a substituted alkene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, the configuration is Z. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side. But wait, does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's see. The molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has CH(CH3) and another CH2. Let me draw the structure: Cl is on C1, which is connected to C2 (double bond), which has a methyl group and another CH2. So, C1 has Cl, a CH2CH2 (or maybe CH2-CH2?), wait no, maybe I should write it out.

Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon (which is double bonded), and 2-methyl is a CH(CH3) on the second carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, butene is four carb
