Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are allowed kinematically at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, maybe I should make sense of that. So it's a Yukawa-type interaction, right? Because Yukawa interactions usually have terms like ψ ψ times a scalar, which here is (v + X). So that would imply that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

But wait, wait. Looking at the Lagrangian, the term is -λf ψ_f (υ + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is ψ_f ψ_f X, but that doesn't seem right because for fermions, you need to contract the spinor indices properly. Oh wait, maybe it's actually ψ_f bar times ψ_f, but no, that would imply a scalar term. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the actual term is a Yukawa coupling term where X couples to the fermion ψ_f with a coupling strength λf.

So the boson X interacts with fermions of type ψ_f. So the decay of X would be into a pair of these fermions. So if X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, then the allowed decays depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that it can decay into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two other particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of the original particle.

So, let's list the possible fermion pairs. The options given include things like b bbar, c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, tau+ tau-, and various leptons.

Wait, each fermion has a certain mass. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Quarks: up and down are light, maybe around 2-5 MeV each, so negligible compared to GeV scales. Strange is about 100 MeV, charm about 1.5 GeV, bottom (beauty) about 4.5 GeV, top is around 173 GeV.

So the X boson is 6 GeV. Let's see what fermion pairs it can decay into.

First, the X would decay into pairs of fermions where each has a mass less than 3 GeV (since 2m < M_X). So:

- For charged leptons: e, mu, tau. Tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2
