Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the same molecular formula, C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. The molecular formula C10H14... aromatic compounds, so probably substituted benzene rings. Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, wait. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups in the para positions. Its structure is benzene with two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Molecular formula for that would be C10H14? Let's see: benzene (C6H6) plus two ethyl groups (each C2H5), so 6 + 4 carbons = C10. Hydrogens: 6 from benzene, each ethyl has 5 H but a substitution would replace one H each. Wait, benzene has 6 H; each substitution replaces one H. So two substitutions would leave 4 H. Each ethyl has 5 H, but since they're attached to the ring, each contributes 5. So 4 (from benzene) + 2*
