Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait a second, isn't that a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>?

I think about what this matrix looks like. The |0><0| term is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in the (1,1) position. Adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2 would make it 1/2 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I recall that qubits are two-level systems, so the state space is a Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices in two dimensions (qubits) can be represented on the Bloch sphere as well. The density matrix ρ is a 2x2 matrix, so it's a single qubit state.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector with components (x,y,z). Oh wait, right! The vector r determines the state on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, r would have a magnitude of 1, but for a mixed state, it's less than 1.

Let's write out the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. |0> is [1,0]^T, so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2. 

Wait, so if ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, then r must be (0,0,0), right? Because the identity matrix doesn't have any of the Pauli terms. So the vector r is zero, meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. That's the completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, so no direction is favored.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), which is a completely mixed state. The density matrix can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector that determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere. Comparing the two expressions, we see that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
