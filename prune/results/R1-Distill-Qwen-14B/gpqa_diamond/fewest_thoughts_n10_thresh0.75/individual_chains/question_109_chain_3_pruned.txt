Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics and quantum mechanics. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem states that two nucleons are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. We need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, so the initial state is 1S0. I remember that the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0, and J=0. Because 2*0 +1 is 1, so the term is 1S0. So the initial total spin is S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

They emit a particle X, and the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Oh right, T is the isospin. But I think I'll focus on the angular momentum and parity first.

Pauli statistics says that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, what's T here? Oh, T is the isospin of the NN system. So for T=0, we have 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

But wait, the initial state is 1S0, so S=0 and L=0. So the initial state has S=0 (even), L=0 (even). So the initial state S and L are even, but after emission of X, the final NN state has T=0, so their S and L must satisfy S + L is 1 mod 2.

Hmm, so in the final state, the NN's S and L must add to odd.

But the total angular momentum J of the NN system must also be conserved, considering the angular momentum of the emitted particle. Also, parity must be conserved.

Wait, the parity of the entire system must be conserved. The initial state is 1S0: let's compute its parity. For the NN system, parity is (-1)^
