Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are several steps given, and some hints. The options are four different cyclic ketones, so I'm thinking E is a ketone.

Let me start by writing down each step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there's a hint from the IR data. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which likely indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. Compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a different kind, perhaps an ester or another ketone. But since the options are all ketones, E is probably a ketone as well.

Looking at hint a), it says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that product, A must have a carbonyl group, which aligns with the IR data.

The product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is like a methylene (CH2) group attached to a methyl group (propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be -CH2-C(CH3)= , perhaps? Or maybe it's a substituted methylene group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure of the product. 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. The propan-2-ylidene would be a methylene group (CH2) attached to a CH(CH3) group. Or wait, more accurately, the substituent is a propenyl group with the double bond starting at the 2-position.

Wait, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is =CH-CH(CH3)-. No, maybe the structure is like (CH2=C(CH3)2)- but I'm not
