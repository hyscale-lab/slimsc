Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can detect in terms of star brightness. The question says that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, right, magnitude scales are a bit counterintuitive. Lower numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star has a V magnitude less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Because, like, brighter than 17 meaning magnitude is lower than 17. Wait, no, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. So wait, the magnitude scale is such that lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a star at magnitude 16 is brighter than one at 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the V magnitude must be less than 16. So any star with V_mag <=16 can be detected by HIRES, and any with V_mag <=17 can be detected by ESPRESSO.

The goal is to find stars that can be detected by both. So their apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because ESPRESSO goes up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the actual question is about which stars can be detected with both. So the star must satisfy the condition for both instruments. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). So the more restrictive condition is <=16. So the star's apparent V mag must be <=16.

But wait, looking at the question again: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"
