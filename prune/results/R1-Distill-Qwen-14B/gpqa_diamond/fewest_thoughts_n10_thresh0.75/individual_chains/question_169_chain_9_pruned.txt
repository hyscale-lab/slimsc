Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a decay process. The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the energy spectrum of E particles change compared to the original?

Hmm. I remember that in nuclear decays, the conservation of energy and momentum plays a big role. Also, beta decay and other similar processes often involve continuous spectra because the emitted particles can share energy and momentum in various ways.

In the original decay, we have two E and two V particles. Let's think about what E and V are. Since E and V are lighter, perhaps they are leptons, like electrons and neutrinos? Or maybe they are other types of particles. But their masses would matter here.

Wait, but in the original case, E is a much lighter particle. So if E is like an electron, and V is a neutrino, but neutrinos are very light. Or maybe V is a photon? Or perhaps, in the original decay, the V particles are of some other kind.

But the fact that the E spectrum is continuous tells me that the decay products (like E and V) have a range of possible energies. In beta decay, for example, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino takes away some energy, and the combination of electron and neutrino energies can vary, leading to a continuous distribution for the electron.

In the initial decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, so we have two E and two V. If E and V are massless or very light, maybe this is similar to a decay where multiple particles are emitted, leading to a continuous spectrum for E.

Now, in the variant, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So instead of two V particles, it emits one M, which is exotic and massless. So, M is like a new particle. Since it's massless, it might move at the speed of light, similar to a photon.

I'm trying to think about how the number of emitted particles affects the energy spectrum. Let's consider the original case with two V particles. When multiple particles are emitted, energy and momentum are shared, and the possible energy of E depends on the other particles' energies and momenta.

In the original decay, the E particles share energy with two V particles. So the energy of E can vary depending on how the energy is partitioned between the V's. That gives a continuous spectrum for E, as any energy less than the maximum Q is possible.

In the variant, we have M instead of two V's. But M is a single massless particle. So now, the energy available to E would depend on the energy and momentum of M. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c (but perhaps we can ignore constants for this thought).

But wait, since
