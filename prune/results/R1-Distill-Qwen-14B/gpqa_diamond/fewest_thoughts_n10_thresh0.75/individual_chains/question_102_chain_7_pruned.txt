Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair. Hmm, I need to figure out why there's no green signal when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope.

Let me start by going through the setup. The ligand and receptor are expressed in neural crest cells, and they're studying their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So, the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which allows it to be expressed in a different way, maybe constitutively or in a different cell type?

Wait, no, I think in bicistronic vectors, the two genes are under separate promoters. But wait, the description says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. So perhaps the vector is designed so that the ligand is expressed from CBA, and the receptor is expressed via an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed in a different context. Or maybe in the same mRNA, but I'm not sure. 

The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. So, when Cre is present, it'll recombine the loxP sites, allowing expression of the ligand (fused to mCherry) and the receptor (fused to eGFP), because the stop cassettes would be removed.

So they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes, and then made a mouse model homozygous for this construct. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest derivatives, including some glial cells. Cre would be expressed under SOX10 promoter, so in the same cells where the neural crest genes are active.

After crossing, the offspring are visualized under confocal. They don't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but the construct is probably designed to express both in the same cell. Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are on the same cell, that's autocrine. If they're on different cells, it's paracrine. But the absence of green signal isn't directly about the relationship but about expression. So this option might not explain the lack of eGFP.

Option B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If the receptor wasn't trafficked to the membrane, eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why? Maybe the construct is misfolded. But the absence of both mCherry and eGFP would be more likely if the vector isn't working. However, the question says they used antibodies for both proteins and ran a Western blot. They saw signal proportional to actin, which suggests the proteins were expressed. Wait, the question says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. But in the mouse model, they're trying to see the eGFP. So maybe the Western blot was done before crossing, in cell culture? Or maybe in the mouse, the expression is not happening? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that part.

Option C) The enhancer is missing. So, without an enhancer, the promoter might not be active. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. IRES is usually constitutive, but if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the vector design includes CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor. So perhaps the expression relies on the surrounding regulatory elements. Wait, but the vector is in the mouse, so perhaps the construct isn't under the right enhancers. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells where the Cre is active, like the neural crest derivatives. But in the setup, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor. So the expression should be Cre-dependent. If the enhancer is missing, then maybe the CBA promoter isn't working. But CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe that's not the issue.

Option D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't properly fused, so when the receptor is expressed, the eGFP might not be functional. But if it's a stop cassette, then the receptor ORF is after the stop. When Cre is present, the lox2272 sites are recombined, removing the stop, so the receptor should be expressed. But if the eGFP isn't in frame, the fusion protein might not be made correctly. Alternatively, the stop codon could still be in frame, leading to no eGFP. Wait, I'm a bit confused. If the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, then when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor ORF to be expressed. But if the
