Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, you can't just subtract their speeds because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So, for the relative speed, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Oh wait, right, because when objects are moving at speeds close to c, their relative speed isn't simply the difference. So in this case, the astronaut with speed 0.6c is moving faster than the other who's at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the 0.6c astronaut, what's the speed of the 0.5c astronaut?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. Both in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second as seen by the first would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity would be (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Taking the absolute value, it's about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. Hmm, the total energy of the system
