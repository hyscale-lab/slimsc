Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, based on the given relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Parallax, plx, is related to distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the problem says N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N becomes k * (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d) is d, so (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's about how N changes as r increases. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the derivative or the rate of change. Like, how does the number of stars change when you go from distance r to r + dr? That would be the differential dn/dr, which tells you the rate of change per unit distance.

Since N is proportional to d^5, the
