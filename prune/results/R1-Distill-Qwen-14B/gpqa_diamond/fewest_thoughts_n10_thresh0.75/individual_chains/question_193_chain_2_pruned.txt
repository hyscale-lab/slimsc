Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx', right? So the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So parallax (p) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but wait, in what units? Oh, right, parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs. So p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. That makes sense because the closer a star is (smaller d), the larger its parallax (since p=1/d, so for d=1, p=1; for d=2, p=0.5, etc.).

So if p = 1/d, then I can rewrite the given relation in terms of d. The number of stars N is proportional to 1 over p^5. Substituting p with 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh right, because when you're looking at a range of distances, you need to consider how the number of stars per unit distance changes.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number. Like
