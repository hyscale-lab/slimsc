Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll try to think through it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Okay, so I know that an eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. 

Wait, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh right, that looks familiar. I think S is similar to the Pauli matrices, but maybe scaled or something. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, like S here. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, so S here is actually the Pauli Y matrix. 

So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, Ay is c times S, with c = h/(4π). So Ay = (h/4π) * σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

Alternatively, since S is a Pauli matrix, maybe I can use some properties. Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if Ay = c σ_y, then the eigenvalues would be c * (±1).

Wait, let me see. Let me compute it.

The Pauli Y matrix is:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So Ay is (h/(4π)) times that. So:

Ay = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
       [(i h)/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I can compute the trace and determinant.

The trace of Ay is 0 + 0 = 0.

The determinant is (0)(0) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4
