Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, since the question is about a pseudosphere, maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether it's a 2D or 3D object. Oh wait, the metric here looks like it's in two dimensions because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but for the purposes of the metric, it's 2D.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but pseudospheres are usually discussed in the context of hyperbolic geometry, right? So their properties are different from spheres.

Wait, I think the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) in hyperbolic geometry. But how does that translate into the metric given here?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided describes a pseudosphere. Let me think about the form of the metric. It looks like it's conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 -
