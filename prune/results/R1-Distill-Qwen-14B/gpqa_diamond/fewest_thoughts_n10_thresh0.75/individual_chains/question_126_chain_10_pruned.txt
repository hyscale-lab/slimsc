Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. After each reaction is done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to determine the number of peaks observed in each case.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's known to reduce ketones. Since the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one, the reaction should reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, and the configuration of the starting material is S, so the product's configuration—does it change? LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to retention of configuration. So the alcohol would have the same R/S configuration as the starting ketone.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone. NaBH4 is a mild reducing agent. Wait, but NaBH4 usually can't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH, but wait, in some cases, like when there are multiple ketone groups, maybe it can. Or perhaps, since it's in excess, it can. Alternatively, maybe it's a different scenario. Oh wait, wait, I think I remember that pentane-2,4-dione, when treated with NaBH4, can undergo a double reduction. So each ketone group would get reduced. So the product would be pentane-2,4-diol. Because each carbonyl becomes a CH2OH group. Wait, but wait—no, wait: pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So when you reduce each ketone, you get two secondary alcohols. But wait, in reality, when a diketone is treated with NaBH4, it can form a diol. Alternatively, perhaps under certain conditions, it might form a different product, but I think in this case, it's a diol.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH2)2(C=O)CH2(C=O). So structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So when treated with excess NaBH4, each ketone (two of them) would be reduced to an alcohol. So each becomes CH2(OH). So the product is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2? No, wait: pentane-2,4-dione is (CH2)2(CO)CH2CO? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out in my mind. Pentane has 5 carbons. 2,4-dione would have ketones at positions 2 and 4. So the structure is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, wait, wait. Oh, wait, that's butane? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione: carbon 1 is CH3, carbon 2 is C=O, carbon 3 is CH2, carbon 4 is C=O, and carbon 5 is CH3. So structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4,5. 2 and 4 are ketones. So structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Let me think again. Wait, no, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2. Wait, no, that's five carbons? Wait, 1: CH3, 2: C(=O), 3: CH2, 4: C(=O), 5: CH3? No, that wouldn't add up because between two ketones, there's a CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CO? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused, but regardless, each ketone group is reduced to a CH2OH.

Wait, but actually, pentane-2,4-dione upon reduction with NaBH4 would give pentane-2,4-diol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but that's four carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, pentane-2,4-d
