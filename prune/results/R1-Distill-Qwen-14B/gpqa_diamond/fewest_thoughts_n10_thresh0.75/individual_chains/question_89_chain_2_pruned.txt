Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what's happening in each part.

The question begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. But wait, adamantane is a pretty unique structure. It's a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so it's a four-fused cyclohexane structure. The 1,3-dibromo substitution would be on adjacent carbons in this structure.

Heating with KOH probably leads to an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe a di-elimination occurs? Wait, but dihalides usually form alkenes when two molecules lose H and X. So two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons would eliminate to form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene? Or wait, maybe it's a bridged structure. Oh wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane has a structure where each bridge has two CH2 groups. Wait, no, adamantane itself is a diamondoid, so each bridge is a single carbon. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgeheads. When KOH is used, the base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond.

But wait, if two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, maybe they eliminate to form a conjugated diene? Or perhaps a single double bond? Let me think. For elimination, each Br would leave, but since they're vicinal (adjacent), the elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Br was. So the product would be 1,3-diamantadiene? But wait, I'm not sure about the exact structure, but perhaps the product is an adamantyl diene.

The product is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene because alkenes are often less polar and can have colors if conjugated, but wait, perhaps it's a diene. The NMR spectrum given is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but after elimination, we'd expect an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another reaction possibility: Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If the solvent is aqueous, perhaps it's a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric, so substitution would lead to the same product as elimination? Or maybe elimination is more likely because of the strong base.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide formation usually requires peracids or other epoxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure that's applicable here.

Wait, let's think about the IR data. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps instead of elimination, it's a nucleophilic substitution with water or another nucleophile. But with KOH, maybe it's a hydrolysis. Wait, but dihalides can undergo hydrolysis to form ketones if the structure allows. Oh! Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo intramolecular elimination with KOH. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, and the two bromides leave, forming a carbonyl group. So this would be the formation of a ketone.

Let me think about that. If two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons, and KOH is present, perhaps each Br leaves as Br- and the adjacent carbons form a double bond with oxygen, leading to a carbonyl. But wait, that might form a ketone. For example, if each C-Br is on adjacent carbons, and upon dehydrohalogenation, they lose H and Br, forming a double bond between the two carbons, but that would be an alkene. But wait, if the base is strong enough, maybe it causes a further reaction, like oxidation or something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two bromines are eliminated as Br2, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. But that would require the formation of a carbonyl, which would indicate a ketone. So perhaps the product is adamantanone. Wait, let me think about adamantane's structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. If two adjacent bridgehead carbons each have a Br, then elimination would form a
