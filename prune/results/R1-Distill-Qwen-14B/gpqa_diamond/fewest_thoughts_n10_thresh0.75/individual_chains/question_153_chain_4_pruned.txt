Okay, so I have this problem about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I'll need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). The reaction is a Michael addition. 

Wait, what's a Michael addition again? Oh right! It's a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate in this case) attacks the beta position of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate is the nucleophile, and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the electrophile.

So, dimethyl malonate is the enolate source. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the other compound, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the correct position. Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the CH2 part. So it's CH2-C(Ph)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2-CH-CO-OEt, but with the substituent on the second carbon. So the
