Okay, let's see. I've got a problem here about organic chemistry reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

So, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. Trans means the substituents are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure how that affects the reactions yet.

First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide. Oh, wait, that's a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents usually add to carbonyl groups. So cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group (the aldehyde), so the Grignard will attack that. 

When an aldehyde reacts with a Grignard reagent, it adds twice? Or wait, no, wait. Aldehydes have a carbonyl group (RCHO). Grignard reagents (R-Mg-X) add once to aldehydes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ketones only react once because there's no hydrogen on the carbonyl. Aldehydes have an alpha H (the one next to the carbonyl), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the aldehyde is RCHO. Grignard adds once to the aldehyde, giving RCH2OMgBr, which upon protonation gives RCH2OH... wait, no, wait. No, wait, when the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, it's a two-step addition because the aldehyde can only take one equivalent? Wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with ketones. Aldehydes have the structure RCHO. Grignard adds once to the carbonyl, so the oxygen gets the negative charge, then the Grignard adds another equivalent? No, wait, Grignard can't add twice to the same carbonyl because the aldehyde doesn't have two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! For ketones, one equivalent of Grignard adds. For aldehydes, same thing. So when a Grignard reacts with an aldehyde, it adds once, giving an alcohol after workup.

Wait, wait, but wait. When you have an aldehyde and you add a Grignard, the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives an alcohol. So for RCHO + 1 equivalent of RMgX, you get RCH2OR'? No, wait, no. Let me think. The aldehyde is RCH=O. The Grignard (MeMgBr) attacks the carbonyl carbon, turning it into RCH(O-) - then the MgBr-O- part. Then, after workup (like acid), you get RCH2-OH? No, wait, wait. Wait, the aldehyde has R-CHO. Grignard adds to carbonyl, gives R-CH(MgBr)-O- something. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about the product.

Wait, when an aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with a Grign
