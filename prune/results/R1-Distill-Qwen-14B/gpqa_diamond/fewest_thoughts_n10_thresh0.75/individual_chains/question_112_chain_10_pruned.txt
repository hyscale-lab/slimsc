Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I remember that the z-projection is along the z-axis, and the spin-up and spin-down states are orthonormal.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the matrix is diagonal? Because if i=j, it's zero, and for i≠j, it's ħ/2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Wait, the problem says A_ij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, else zero. So the matrix is 2x2, probably, since it's dealing with spin-1/2 particles.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements would be zero and the off-diagonal elements would be ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, that's the same as the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, this A matrix is (ħ/2) times sigma_x. So the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X operator.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), I think. Because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the operator A would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so
