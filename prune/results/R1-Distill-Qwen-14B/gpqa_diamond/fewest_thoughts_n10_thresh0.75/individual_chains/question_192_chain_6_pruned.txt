Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, so the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with different expressions involving these variables. 

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Oh right! Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field is zero. Charges reside on the surface. But wait, in this case, the conductor is neutral, and there's a cavity with a charge inside. 

Wait, so the conductor was initially uncharged. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor? Oh, right! The conductor will induce charges on its inner and outer surfaces. Since the conductor is neutral, the total induced charge must sum to zero. 

So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because opposite charges attract. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Because the total conductor was neutral, the inner surface has -q and the outer has +q, making the total zero.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, so when considering a point outside the conductor, the electric field should be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Or wait, not necessarily the center. Because the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center, but shifted.

Wait, no. Hold on. When you have a charge inside a cavity, the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor are such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So
