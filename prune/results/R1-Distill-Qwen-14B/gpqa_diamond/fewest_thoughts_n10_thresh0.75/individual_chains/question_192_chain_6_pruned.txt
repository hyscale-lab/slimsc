Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember from my textbook that when dealing with conductors, charges reside on the surface. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity, so there's a bit more to think about.

The setup is a spherical conductor of radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity with radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the main conductor's center. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Got it. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta, and both l and L are larger than R, which makes sense because P is outside.

So, first, I need to figure out how the charges are distributed. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, placing +q inside the cavity must induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, how does that work again? Oh right, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface would have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Or wait, no. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q, because the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer. But the conductor is neutral, so inner is -q, outer is +q, so total is zero. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field there, I can treat the conductor as a shell with charge +q on the outside. Because the field outside a conducting shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Oh, right, because the charges on a spherical conductor distribute themselves spherically symmetrically. So for any point outside, the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within that point.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field at point
