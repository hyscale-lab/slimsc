Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside, so the conductor isn't solid all the way. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P which is outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and from the center of the cavity to P is l. Both l and L are bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electrostatics. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think the charges inside would induce some redistribution. But wait, the conductor is neutral, and we're putting a charge inside the cavity. What happens then?

Wait, I think when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. Oh right, the cavity is not touching the conductor's material because it's a conductor with a cavity. So the conductor itself is a shell. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge opposite to q, right? Because the charge q would attract the opposite charges in the conductor's material.

So the inner surface would have a charge of -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, because the total charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, no. Wait the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q.

Wait, but wait. If the conductor is uncharged and then you add a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's net charge remains zero. So the conductor must have charges on the inner and outer surfaces that balance each other. So putting +q inside would cause
