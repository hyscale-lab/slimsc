Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let's see... Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. Oh right, those microscopes use electrons to image samples, and they need a vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with gas molecules, which would blur the image.

He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike knows there are gas molecules present. He determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? Factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment affect that.

So, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something about the mean free path. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is, what can we say about λ2 compared to λ1? The options are about whether it's greater, less, or same as λ1.

Wait, so why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The sample compartment's temperature is the same, so maybe it's not due to temperature changes. What else could affect the mean free path?

Oh, wait, the mean free path depends on the pressure. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Since the temperature is the same, and d and the gas's properties don't change, the pressure must be the same. So why does λ change?

Wait, but in the presence of the electron beam, there might be other factors. The electron beam is high energy—1000 kV is a million volts. When electrons with such high energy pass through the gas, they can cause various interactions. Like, maybe they ionize the gas molecules or cause them to move. Or perhaps the gas molecules get excited and their effective cross-sectional area for scattering changes.

Wait, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density of the gas. So if the number of particles per unit volume (n) increases, λ
