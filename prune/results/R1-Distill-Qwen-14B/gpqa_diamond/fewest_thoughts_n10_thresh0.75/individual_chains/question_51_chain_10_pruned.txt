Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. The question is about the potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But since this involves a conductor, I should remember how grounding affects things. Oh right, grounding means the sphere is connected to the earth, so it can have charges induced on it but any excess charge can flow away.

So, when you place a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will adjust until the conductor's surface is at zero potential. Wait, no, the sphere itself can't have a net charge because it's grounded, unless induced charges from the external charge q. Hmm, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, no. When the charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would leave the sphere, right? So perhaps the sphere ends up with an induced charge induced by q. Wait, no, maybe not. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The conducting sphere is grounded, so any change in its potential would allow charges to flow in or out. But for a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. When you bring a charge q near the grounded sphere, it will induce opposite charges on the
