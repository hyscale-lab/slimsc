Okay, so I have to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is more acidic and easily dissociates, but alcohols also have a broad peak. Hmm.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak. I think that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but wait, sometimes it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Like in conjugated carbonyls or maybe an amide? But wait, the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond, so maybe there's a double bond in the molecule. 

Wait, FTIR can also show peaks for double bonds. The 1650 cm⁻¹ might correspond to a C=C stretch, especially if it's conjugated. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. But then why two peaks? Maybe one is C=O and another is C=C. So, the compound might have both a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a double bond.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, so that suggests the presence of an alkene or aromatic ring. But since the FTIR showed a peak at 1650, which is lower than a typical alkene (usually around 1600-1680). Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring. Because aromatic C=C has peaks around that region, but then why would there be a peak at 1700? Maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like in a benzene ring with a ketone or ester substituent.

But wait, let's think about the possible functional groups. If the IR shows a broad peak (O-H) and
