Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says. 

The unknown compound has been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each of these techniques and the data they provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the question says it's a very broad peak. Oh, right, carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches because the -OH group is more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds, making the peak broader. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, but I'm not sure. 

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone. Wait, another thought: aromatic rings with substituents can cause absorption around 1600-1650 cm⁻¹. But since we have 1700 and 1650, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters typically have a strong carbonyl around 1730-1750, but sometimes lower if there's conjugation or other effects. Or maybe it's a ketone with a conjugated double bond, which could lower the carbonyl stretch. 

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That means the structure likely contains a double bond, maybe part of a ring or a substituent.

The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. The molecular ion might break down into fragments. What fragments give m/z 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) + 30 (OCH3? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is 15*2 +16=46. Oh wait, 45. Let me think: 45 could be a fragment like (CH2O), which is formaldehyde, but that's 30? No. Wait, C3H7O? No, that would be more. Alternatively, maybe a CO group plus something. Or perhaps a fragment like CH2=CH-O- something? Or maybe a CH2 group and an O somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something. Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight for C3H7O (but that's 3*12 +7 +16=45
