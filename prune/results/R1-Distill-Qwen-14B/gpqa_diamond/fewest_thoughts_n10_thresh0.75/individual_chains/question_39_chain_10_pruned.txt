Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the state of a particle. The modulus squared of the wave function gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position. So, for each particle, the probability of being found between x=1 and x=3 should be 1 because the problem says that none were found outside this range. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So, all particles are found in that region. That means the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, but typically, wave functions can be complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So, let me think about that. The wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5)i. So ψ(x) = A - iB, where A = a/sqrt(1+x) and B=0.5.

The probability density is |ψ|^2 = (A^2 + B^2). Because when you compute (A - iB)(A + iB), you get A²
