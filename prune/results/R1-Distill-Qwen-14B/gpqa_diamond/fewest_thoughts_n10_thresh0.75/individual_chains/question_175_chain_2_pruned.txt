Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It says it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric around the z-axis, the radiation should be dipole-like, I think. Dipole radiation has a specific angular dependence.

Dipole radiation's intensity (which relates to power per unit solid angle) depends on the angle θ. For a dipole, the intensity pattern is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). Wait, no, wait. Or is it (sin²θ) or (1 + 3cos²θ) or something like that? Oh right, the dipole radiation pattern for the intensity (which is proportional to the square of the electric field) is given by I ∝ (1 + cos²θ). So at θ=0 (along the axis), the intensity is maximum, and it has minima at θ=90 degrees because cos90=0. Wait, no, wait again. Wait, actually, the intensity for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but when you integrate over all angles, you get the total power.

Wait, but in the problem, the maximum power is A. So at what θ is the maximum intensity? Let me think. The function f(θ, λ) is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum power occurs when this function is maximum. So for a dipole, what's the maximum?

The intensity is maximum when (1 + cos²θ) is maximum. The maximum is when cosθ is 1 or -1, so θ=0. So the maximum is at
