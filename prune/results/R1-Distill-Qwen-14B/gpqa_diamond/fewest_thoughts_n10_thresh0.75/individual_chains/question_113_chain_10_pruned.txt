Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectra data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let me break down each piece of information.

FTIR Spectrum:
- Very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. A broad peak at that region is typical for either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is a ketone or something else, but I think the broadness is more indicative of O-H. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ and another at 1650 cm⁻¹.

Wait, 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. That's typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 cm⁻¹ might be an aromatic ring (C=C) or another carbonyl maybe? Or perhaps an amide or something else, but considering the other data, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, in IR, a peak around 1700 is common for esters, ketones, aldehydes, or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak, and the carbonyl is usually around 1700 as well. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but may vary. Hmm, but here it's 1700. Maybe it's a ketone? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group.

The peak at 1650 could be an aromatic C=C, but if the compound has a carbonyl group, maybe it's conjugated with another group, such as an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't have information about nitrogen here, so probably not.

1H NMR:
- There are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. Maybe a vinyl group or an aromatic ring, but vinyl is more like an isolated double bond.

Mass Spectrometry:
- Fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH₃O⁻ (32) + something? Or maybe it's (CH₂O) which is 30? Wait, 45 is more like C3H7O, but wait, wait, the exact composition... Let me think of possible fragments. 45 could be (CH₂)₂O, which is 44 (since CH₂ is 14, 14*2=28, 28+16=44). Alternatively, maybe it's (CO)₂O? No, that's 78. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the m/z 45 is a fragment like a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. Let me think about the options.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all these are possible organic compounds.

Let me consider each piece of data to eliminate options.

Starting with the IR.

The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H group. So looking at the options:

A: C6H12O2 → possible ester or carboxylic acid, maybe something with two oxygen containing groups.
B: C6H10O → maybe an alcohol or ketone, but the broad peak would suggest O-H, so likely an alcohol.
C: C6H10O2 → could be a carboxylic acid (COOH), which has both O-H and a carbonyl, or an ester.
D: C6H12O → maybe an alcohol or ether.

Wait, but the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but the carbonyl would be around 1700, which fits. But carboxylic acids usually have a lower carbonyl peak, like around 1700. However, if the compound is an ester, the carbonyl would be higher, around 1730-1750. So the 1700 suggests maybe a ketone or a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone, the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 (for C=O) and the broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H elsewhere. Wait, but ketones don't have O-H. So if the broad peak is O-H, then the compound has an O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, that's a point of confusion. Let me clarify: FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That could be either an O-H (like in alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenol) or maybe an N-H (but no info about nitrogen). So I'll focus on O-H.

So, if
