Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The problem gives me a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is written as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is measured using relative entropy. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

I need to compute the nG for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, but wait, what's a Gaussian state? Oh right, Gaussian states are states whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. Coherent states are Gaussian, as are thermal states and squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states include things like Fock states (number states), cat states, etc.

The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated by comparing the state to a reference Gaussian state. The idea is that the more non-Gaussian a state is, the higher this measure would be.

So, for the given |psi>, I need to find rho, the density matrix. Since it's a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|.

But wait, how does this density matrix compare to a Gaussian state? The problem says tau is the reference Gaussian state. But what Gaussian state should I be using as a reference? The question doesn't specify, so maybe I should think about what the reference Gaussian state is for a superposition state like this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the closest Gaussian state to the given state. Or maybe it's the state that shares some properties, like the same first moments or something? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But wait, I recall that for a state like this, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state could be the thermal state or perhaps a squeezed state. Or maybe the reference is the completely mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the most similar Gaussian state to the given state.
