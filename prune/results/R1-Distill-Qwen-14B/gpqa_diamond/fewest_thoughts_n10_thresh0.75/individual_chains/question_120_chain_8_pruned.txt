Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, parallax is something I remember relates to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and vice versa.

Okay, the setup says the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, I think it means their density is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a region doesn't depend on how far away you look, but just the volume. Because if they're uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance.

Parallax plx is related to distance by the formula plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1 / plx. Right, because d is in parsecs, so if plx is 1 arcsec, the distance is 1 parsec. Wait, no, wait. The formula is d = 1 / plx. So when parallax increases, distance decreases. That makes sense.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's think about a thin shell of stars at a certain distance. The volume of a thin spherical shell is approximately 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. But since we're talking about parallax, let's express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1 / plx, dr would be the change in distance. Let me relate dr to the change in parallax. So, dr = (change in distance) = - (1 / plx²) * d plx. Because d = 1/plx, so derivative is -1/plx² d plx. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the signs right. Let's focus on magnitudes.

The number of stars in a thin shell would depend on the volume of the shell and the density. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the density is constant. So the number of stars N is proportional to the volume of the shell and the density. Since density is uniform, N ∝ 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But we need this in terms of parallax.

Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute. So d = (1 / plx). Then, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're looking for the number per unit plx, perhaps we can express the number in terms of plx.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for a small change in plx, say d plx, how many stars are there? So for each d plx, the corresponding change in d is dd = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx. So the volume element in terms of plx is 4πd² dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -(1/plx²) d plx:

Volume element = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 d plx) )

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction, so for the magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

d^2 = (1/plx)^2.

dd = (change in d) = (d (1/plx)) ) = -1/(plx^2) d plx.

So the volume element (dV) for a thin shell would be surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness (dd). So dV = 4πd² dd.

Substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ -1/(plx²) d plx ]

So dV = -4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx.

Which is
