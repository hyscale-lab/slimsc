Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax. So distance d ≈ 1/plx. Oh right, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax angles.

Now, the stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed. So their actual number density is constant in space, right? But when we observe them, the number we see per unit parallax will depend on how the volume they occupy changes with distance.

Let me think about volume. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by the volume element dr, assuming uniform density. So n = 4πd² dr * (number density), but since number density is constant, n is proportional to d² dr.

Wait, but the question is about how the number per unit parallax changes. Parallax plx is 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that in.

So the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx corresponds to a distance from d to d + dd, where dd = d (d+dplx?), wait maybe I should think in terms of plx. Let's see.

The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. So if we have a small change in parallax dplx, we need to relate that to the change in distance dd. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = (d/dplx)(1/plx) = -1/(plx²) dplx. Oh, because d is 1/plx, so the derivative is negative, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe we can ignore the sign.

So dd = (1/(plx²)) dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be 4πd² * (dd) * (number density). Since number density is constant, the number per unit plx is proportional to d² * dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx, d² = 1/(plx²). And dd is 1/(plx²) dplx. So putting it together: 1/(plx²) * (1/(plx²) dplx) = 1/(plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit plx. So the number per dplx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit range of plx (like per 0.1 arcseconds) would decrease as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

But wait, let me make sure I got this right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the differential number. Let me try a different approach. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in that shell multiplied
