Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question gives two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. I think evolved stars might be larger, but here their radii are the same, so that's a clue.

Wait, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for the probability (P) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some geometric factors. But maybe more accurately, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 + (a_p / R_s)) )^-1 or something like that? Or perhaps it's more about the orbital plane's inclination — the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for a transit, divided by the total possible area.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a_p / R_s) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ), but since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so the denominator simplifies. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p), but only if the orbit is edge-on. Wait, maybe the exact formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p * sin i)), but this doesn't directly apply because sin i is 1 for edge-on. Wait, no, the probability is actually the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for a transit. The probability is (R_p
