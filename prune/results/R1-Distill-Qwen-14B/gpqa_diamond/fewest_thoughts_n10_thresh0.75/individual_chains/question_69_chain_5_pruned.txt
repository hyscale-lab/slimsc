Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, with various resolutions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. So, when particles decay, the lifetime they experience is their proper time, τ₀. But from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so time dilation comes into play. The observed lifetime τ is longer than τ₀. The formula for time dilation is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = E/mc². Oh wait, since E is given in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², maybe I can find γ directly.

So, the energy E is 27 GeV. The mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². So γ would be E/(m c²) but wait, E is already in units that include c², right? Because in particle physics, energy is often given as E = γ m c². So in natural units, where c=1, E (GeV) = γ m (GeV/c²) * c². So E = γ m c², but since E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², perhaps E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²), but with units? Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of units that make this easier. Alternatively, perhaps γ is E/(m). Let me see.

Wait, more accurately, γ is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So:

γ = E / (m c²)

But since E is given in GeV, and m in GeV/c², let me compute it. Let me compute E/(m). Because E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So, E/(m c²) is (27 GeV) / (
