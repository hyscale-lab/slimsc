Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the paramagnetic coupling term in a hydrogen atom under a magnetic field. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're comparing the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ to the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much larger, much smaller, comparable, or greater than ΔE.

Wait, first I need to recall what the paramagnetic coupling term is. From what I remember, in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of an atom can split due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external field. This is called the Zeeman effect. The paramagnetic coupling term is the perturbation energy due to this effect.

The energy shift from the Zeeman effect is given by the formula ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but the question says m is small. So m could be ±1, 0 maybe? Or perhaps even lower, but for hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 0 for s orbitals, but in other cases, l can be higher. Wait, no, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is for the orbital angular momentum, which depends on l. But the question says m is small. Hmm, but in the context of Hydrogen, for a given state, m can range from -l to +l. But if m is small, like near zero, then the shift would be small.

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling is usually associated with the spin-orbit interaction, but maybe in this case, it's the orbital contribution. Or perhaps it's the spin Zeeman effect. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, which have spin magnetic moments. The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment (which is gμ
