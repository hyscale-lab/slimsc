Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I think the problem involves the formation of different complexes of cobalt(II) with thiocyanate ions. The stability constants, β, are given for each possible complex. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. The β values are β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16. Wait, that doesn't make sense because β₄ is lower than β₂. Oh wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Or perhaps the order is different. Let me list them again: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the highest β is β3, then β2, then β4, and lowest is β1.

Wait, but I thought the stability constant increases with the number of ligands. Oh, right! The stability constant βn is for the complex with n ligands. So Co(SCN)_n²+ has a β of βn. So higher n means more ligands, hence a more stable complex if β increases.

So, β1 is for Co(SCN)²+, β2 is for Co(SCN)_2²+, β3 for Co(SCN)_3²+, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4²+. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63) and β2 (40). So the complexes don't get more stable beyond a certain point. Hmm, that's interesting.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato refers to the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So Co(SCN)_2²+ is the dithiocyanato complex. So we're looking for the concentration of that particular species relative to all the cobalt species.

The initial concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Wait, wait, but when Co forms complexes, the free [SCN-]
