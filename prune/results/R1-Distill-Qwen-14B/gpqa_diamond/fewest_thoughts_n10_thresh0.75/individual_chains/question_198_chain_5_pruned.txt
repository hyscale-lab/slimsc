Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in solution. I remember that when ligands bind to metal ions, they form complexes with different stability constants, which determine their concentration in solution.

Alright, the problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that last one is lower than the others. So the complexes must have different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, I think the stability constant (β) refers to the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. For example, the first complex Co(SCN) would have β1, the second would be Co(SCN)_2 with β2, and so on. But I'm not sure about the order. Oh wait, the β values increase: 9, 40, 63 — except β4 is 16, which is lower. That might complicate things a bit.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato probably means two SCN- ligands. So the complexes would be Co(SCN)n, where n is the number of ligands. The blue one is likely the one with two SCN- ions, so that would be the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, corresponding to β2 being 40.

Wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Because the stability constants are for the successive addition of ligands. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, and so on. So the overall stability of CoLₙ is the product of the individual β's up to n. Or wait, maybe each β is for the step-wise formation. So β1 is the formation of CoL from Co and L. β2 is the formation of CoL₂ from CoL and L. So β2 would be the second formation constant, meaning the second ligand adds with
