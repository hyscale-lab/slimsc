Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λfψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on Lagrangians, but I think this describes an interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to determine what particles X can decay into. From what I remember, when a boson decays, the decay products must have a combined mass that's less than the mass of the boson. Because of conservation laws and energy considerations, the total mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the original particle.

Looking at the options, they list various fermion-antifermion pairs. So the boson X is decaying into these pairs. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses.

Wait, but wait, the fermions available are the quarks and leptons. The masses I should consider are the rest masses of the particles. Because, for X to decay into a pair of particles, each must be less than half the X mass. Because the two particles' rest masses should add up to less than X's mass. Wait, no. Actually, each particle's mass must be less than the X mass, but when they come in pairs (like e+ and e-), each has mass m, so 2m < M_X. So for each fermion f, the condition is 2m_f < M_X.

But wait, in reality, for a particle to decay into a pair, the sum of the rest masses of the pair (each being m_f) must be less than M_X. So 2m_f < M_X.

So first, what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So each fermion f must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me think: for a spin-0 boson (like a scalar), the decay into two fermions would require that the fermion pair's invariant mass is less than the boson's mass. Since each fermion has rest mass m, the minimum energy needed is 2m. So yes, 2m < M_X → m < 3 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the fermions might have other interactions or if the coupling allows it, but the question is about kinematical allowance, which is purely based on mass.

So the available fermions must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Let me list all the known fermions and their masses.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible, but they are light. But the problem is that the given Lagrangian interaction probably couples X to charged leptons, because the term is ψ_f, which is a Dirac fermion. So, maybe neutrinos are not included since the interaction is with X and ψ_f, which I think implies charged leptons.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (but wait, it's around 100 MeV, but some sources say about 105 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV (or around 1.25 GeV, depending on source)
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, so the masses:

u: 2.2 MeV
d: ~4.7 MeV
s: ~95-105 MeV
c: ~1.25 GeV
b: ~4.5 GeV
t: way too heavy.

Leptons:
e: 0.511 MeV
mu: ~105 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV.

So for a fermion f, the mass m_f must satisfy 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions satisfy this.

Charged leptons:
e: m=0.5 MeV → 2m=1 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

mu: 105 MeV → 210 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is greater than 6? No, wait no: 1.78 *2 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced.

What about the others? The tau is the only charged lepton with mass above 1 GeV, but 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is less than 6.

Wait, 6 GeV is the mass. So 3.56 <6 → yes.

So for leptons, e, mu, tau can all be decay products. Because 2m is less than 6.

Now for quarks:

u: 2.2 MeV → 4.4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

d: ~4.7 MeV → 9.4 MeV → allowed.

s: ~100 MeV → 200 MeV → allowed.

c: ~1.25 GeV → 2.5 GeV → allowed, because 2.5 <6.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV. Wait, 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. So 9>6 → not allowed.

Top quark is way too heavy, so can't decay into t tbar.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c. b is too heavy.

So possible decay channels are:

uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, and leptons: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

But wait, wait. Let me check the tau again. 2m_tau is 2*(1.78 GeV) =3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be emitted.

So the allowed are for quarks up to charm (c), but not bottom.

Now looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, tau, e e.

Wait, but b is too heavy. So option A includes b, which can't be allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

But wait, option B includes c, which is allowed, since 2mc=2.5 GeV <6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, and all the leptons (e, mu, tau) are allowed, and the quarks u, d, s.

But what about the bottom quark? No, in option B, the only quarks are c, s, u, d. Because the option says c, s, u, d. So that's correct.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's allowed. So possible.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that includes all the possible fermions with mass m <3 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the decay for the tau. 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so yes, allowed.

What about the muon? 2m_mu is 0.21 GeV, which is 210 MeV, much less than 6 GeV.

So all the fermions in option B are allowed, except perhaps the c quark? Wait, because 2m_c is 2.5 GeV <6 GeV. So yes.

So the possible decay channels are into c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B lists exactly that. So option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of the boson, i.e., \( 2m_f < M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion pair and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). 

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 2.5 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

### Allowed Decays:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) (charged leptons).
- \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( c\bar{c} \) (quarks).

The decay into \( b\bar{b} \) or \( t\bar{t} \) is kinematically forbidden because their rest masses exceed half the mass of \( X \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
