Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when they observe the star's brightness over time (photometric time-series), they notice periodic changes. This is similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude in the light curve? In other words, what's the ratio Rpl/Rstar?

Hmm. So, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the observed effect is different because the spots themselves are cooler and contribute less to the star's total brightness. So the star's brightness variation isn't just about the planet blocking light, but the movement of the spots as the star rotates.

Let me try to break it down.

First, the star's normal brightness would be based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness of the star decreases because a part of it (the spots) contributes less light.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of one hemisphere is covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so the area covered is (0.2) * (2πR²/2) )? Wait, no, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area that's covered by spots. So one hemisphere has area 2πR², and 20% of that is covered. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each spot is cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

Wait, but the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. So the flux from the star's surface is σTeff^4, and the spots have a lower flux, σ(Teff - 1000)^4 = σ(5000)^4.

The total flux from the star when all spots are visible (i.e., when the spotted hemisphere is facing us) would be different than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star isn't covered by spots, what would the planet's radius be to produce the same brightness variation. So I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots, then set that equal to the variation caused by a planet transiting, and find the planet's radius.
