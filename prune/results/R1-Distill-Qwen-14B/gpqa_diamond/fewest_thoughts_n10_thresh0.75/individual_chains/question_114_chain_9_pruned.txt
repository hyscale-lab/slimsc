Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction transformation, and I need to figure out which reagents are suitable. The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing reagents A and B.

First reaction: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with HCN (which is a nucleophile), they undergo addition. But wait, the reagent here is NaCN, not HCN. Oh, maybe it's under acidic conditions?

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a protic solvent, maybe we're doing an acid-catalyzed addition. Because I think the mechanism for the addition of HCN to ketones involves the formation of an oxonium ion, which then allows the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So, butan-2-one would react with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh wait, wait, but NaCN is a cyanide source. So if we have an acid catalyst (like H3O+), it would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, opening it up, and then form the cyanohydrin. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group.

So the first reaction's reagent A is likely H3O+ because it's a strong acid catalyst. Or maybe another source of H+? Let me think. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CN, right? So yes, that's a cyanohydrin formation. So for that, we need acid catalysis. So A should be H3O+.

Second reaction: The product from the first reaction (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) is treated with reagent B and H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, wait. Wait, looking again, the second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Oh, wait no, perhaps I misread. Let me check the second reaction again.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) â†’ 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, but the product is butanoic acid, so the nitrile must have been converted to a carboxylic acid. Oh, so perhaps reagent B is involved in oxidizing the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the starting material in the second reaction is a nitrile (butanenitrile). So to get to a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's being hydrolyzed. But under what conditions does a nitrile hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, typically using H2SO4 as the acid and H2O. The mechanism usually involves protonation, attack by water, and then tautomerism, leading to a carboxylic acid after workup. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with heat.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent B is in parentheses as (H2O), which probably means that the reaction is carried out in the presence of water. So maybe the reagent B is HCl or another acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, for B, the options are HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So for the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid, we need strong acidic hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation under acidic conditions.

Wait, wait, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions. But more commonly, I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires either strong acid or strong base conditions, often with heat.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing this with the oxidation of amines or something else. Let me think again. Nitrile to carboxylic acid: the reaction is done with H2O under acidic (like HCl) or basic (like NaOH) conditions, followed by acid workup. So in the presence of H2O and HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So
