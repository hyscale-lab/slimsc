Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out the final product.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. I'll try to interpret each of these.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with integration 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it could be an acidic proton like an aromatic -OH, but those are usually broader. The triplet might suggest coupling with two other protons, but aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe doublets if coupling. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's tentatively say that's an aldehyde group.

Next, 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d) with 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring where two adjacent protons are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps an ortho coupling? Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is ortho to two others, but maybe in a substituted ring, like a para-substituted with another group.

Then, 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another doublet with 2H. So perhaps adjacent to another proton. Could this be another aromatic ring? Maybe a di-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure yet.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet. Broad usually indicates an exchange with something, like an -OH group. But wait, it's 2H as a singlet. If it's an aromatic ring, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two protons that are equivalent. Or maybe it's a vinyl group. Alternatively, could this be an enol proton? Or perhaps a di-substituted ring where the two protons are equivalent and not split into a doublet because they're coupled with something else.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – a doublet, integrating two protons. This is a singlet? No, wait, it's a doublet. So maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something else. The environment is likely oxygenated, as 3.6 ppm is around where OCH2 groups appear. So perhaps a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or maybe it's part of a hemiacetal or something else.

Now, considering the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of
