Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, and tells me to ignore the rest. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the problem says it's for 50 MeV electrons. I think the formula for the scattering amplitude involves the sum of the phase shifts. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something like f = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * some spherical harmonics terms, but when considering the imaginary part along the beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees.

Wait, when θ is 0, the scattering direction is along the incident beam. So the imaginary part might be determined by specific terms in the amplitude. I remember that the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [e^{2iδ₀} - 1 + ...] but wait, no, because the sum is over all l, but the dominant term at θ=0 might be the first few terms, especially because higher l terms might contribute less.

Alternatively, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by something like (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of sin(2δ_l), where l starts from 0. Because, if I recall correctly, the real part involves cos(2δ_l) and the imaginary part involves sin(2δ_l), each multiplied by (something with the Legendre polynomials, but maybe for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial Pl(cosθ) becomes Pl(1), which is 1 for l=0 and 0 for l>0. Wait, no, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1)=1 for any l because P_l(1) is the sum of the squares, which is 1. Wait, no, actually, P_l(1) is 1 for any l. Because P_l(1) is the value at x=1, which for each l is 1. So that would mean that all the terms contribute for each l. Oh wait, that can't be right because higher l terms are usually only important for certain scattering angles.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written in terms of the partial waves. The general form is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l( cosθ ) e^{i l φ }

But when we're looking at the direction along the beam, θ=0, so cosθ=1. So each P_l(1)=1 for any l. Then, the expression simplifies because e^{i l φ} for φ=0 (which is the direction along the beam, I think φ is the azimuthal angle; along the beam, φ=0). So the exponential terms are all 1.

So, the amplitude becomes (1/(2ik)) Σ [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] * 1 * 1, summed over all contributing l's. But the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ₄, so l goes from 0 to 4. So we sum l=0 to 4.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[ f(0,0) ].

So let's compute f(0) first. f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [e^{2iδ_l} - 1].

Let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Each term is e^{2iδ_l} -1. Let's write that as e^{i 2δ} -1 = 2i sin(δ) e^{i (δ)}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can write e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ} -1 = (cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)) - 1 = (cos(2δ) -1) + i sin(2δ).

So each term is (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So when we sum over l, the real parts add, and the imaginary parts add.

So the total sum is sum_{l=0}^4 [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

Multiply by 1/(2ik) to get f(0).

So f(0) = [ Sum( (cos(2δ) -1) ) + i Sum( sin(2δ) ) ] / (2ik )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ Sum( sin(2δ_l) ) ] / (2k ) , because (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the imaginary part, which is Sum( sin(2δ) ), gives (Sum sin(2δ))/(2ik) → the imaginary part is Sum sin(2δ) * (1/(2k)).

Because 1/i is -i, but when you have a complex number a + ib multiplied by 1/(i c), it becomes (a + ib) / (i c ) = (a/(i c )) + (ib)/(i c ) = (-i a/c) + (b/c ). So the imaginary part would be (b)/(c) because the real part is (-i a/c), which is imaginary. Wait, perhaps it's easier to separate the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, the overall expression for f(0) is:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ Sum ( (cos
