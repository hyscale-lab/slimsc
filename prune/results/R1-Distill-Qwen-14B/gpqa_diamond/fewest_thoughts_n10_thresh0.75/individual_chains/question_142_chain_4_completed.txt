Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The options are four different points in 3D space, so I'm guessing this has to do with how the density matrix is represented in some space, maybe the Bloch sphere or something similar.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, which can be a pure state or mixed state. For a single qubit, the density matrix for a pure state like |0⟩⟨0| is just that outer product, but when you take a mixture, like (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, that's different.

Oh right, when you have equal probabilities for two states, it's a completely mixed state. Because for a pure state, the density matrix would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (ρ²=ρ), but for a mixed state, especially the maximally mixed state, it's different.

I think the maximally mixed state is represented by the identity matrix divided by 2. Because for a single qubit, the identity matrix is 2x2, so (I)/2 would be [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me check what the given ρ is. Expanding it, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is indeed I/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center, right? Because it's the completely mixed state with equal probability of being 0 or 1, and no coherence. So where is the center of the Bloch sphere?

The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and the center is at the origin, which in coordinates would be (0,0,0). Wait, but wait, the Bloch sphere is embedded in 3D space, with coordinates (x,y,z). So the origin is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the completely mixed state.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the right answer. The other options don't make sense. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, the |0⟩ state. Option A is (1,1,0), which I don't think is a valid state on the Bloch sphere. Same with D, which is (1,1,1), which would be outside the Bloch sphere since the radius is 1 (sqrt(3) ≈1.732, which is larger than 1).

So the correct answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, which is a geometric way to visualize quantum states, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states lie inside it. The maximally mixed state, which has equal probability of being in the \(\left|0\right\rangle\) or \(\left|1\right\rangle\) state and no coherence, corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. The center of the Bloch sphere is at the origin, with coordinates \((0,0,0)\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\(r=(1,1,0)\))**: This point is not valid on the Bloch sphere, as it lies outside the sphere.
- **Option B (\(r=(0,0,1)\))**: This corresponds to the pure state \(\left|0\right\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **Option C (\(r=(0,0,0)\))**: This is the center of the Bloch sphere, correctly representing the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D (\(r=(1,1,1)\))**: This point is outside the Bloch sphere, as its distance from the origin exceeds the radius of 1.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
