Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins and finding the partition function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The system has three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Beta is 1/(kT), so each state contributes exp(-E/(kT)) to Z. 

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of the three spins. So I need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy E and count how many states have each E. That would make the calculation easier.

Let me try that. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1 because S_i and S_j are ±1. So the sum can vary based on how many +1 and -1 terms are there.

Wait, but the product S_i S_j is 1 if they are the same, and -1 if different. So each term is ±1. Let's denote each term as T1 = S1S2, T2 = S1S3, T3 = S2S3. So E = -J (T1 + T2 + T3). 

So the sum (T1+T2+T3) can vary. Let's find possible values.

Each T is ±1, so the sum can be from -3 to +3, in steps of 2. But wait, can all the Ts be -1? Let's see.

Wait, wait, let's think about the possible sums. Let me consider all possible combinations of T1, T2, T3. 

But maybe another approach. Let's think about the total sum S = T1 + T2 + T3. We can have S = 3, 1, -1, -3. Wait, because each term is ±1, the sum can be odd numbers between -3 and 3.

Wait, no. Let me compute all possibilities. For three terms each being ±1, the sum can be:

All three +1: sum = 3.

Two +1 and one -1: sum = 1.

One +1 and two -1: sum = -1.

All three -1: sum = -3.

So possible S values are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: can all three terms be -1? That would require S1S2 = S1S3 = S2S3 = -1. Let's see what that implies.

If S1S2 = -1, so S1 and S2 are opposite. Similarly, S1S3 = -1 implies S1 and S3 opposite. So S1 is opposite to both S2 and S3. Then S2 and S3 would be same? Because S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1. So S2 and S3 are same, so S2S3 = +1. But that's a problem because we wanted S2S3 to be -1. So that's impossible. So the case where all three terms are -1 is impossible. Similarly, all three +1 is possible only if all spins are same.

Wait, let's verify that. Let's take S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then all terms are +1. So yes, possible.

If all three terms are -1, that requires S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1
