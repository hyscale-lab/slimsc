Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Oh right, I remember that in two dimensions, the energy levels can depend on the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, I should probably rewrite that to make it clearer. So, V(r,θ) is ½kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me think about how this potential can be broken down.

I remember that for a two-dimensional potential, especially in polar coordinates, it's often helpful to see if the potential can be expressed in terms of r² and other terms that might suggest a separation into radial and angular parts. So, maybe this potential can be written as a central potential plus some angular component.

Wait a second. Let me factor out the r². So, V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ] . Hmm, that might not immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps rewrite it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (2 cos²θ). Because 3/2 = 3/4 * 2, right? So, 3/2 k r² cos²θ = (3/4 k r²)(2 cos²θ).

Wait, I also remember that 2 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, 2 cos²θ = 1 + cos(2θ). So substituting that, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos(2θ)).

Let me compute that. So expanding the terms, I get:

V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r² ) + (3/4 k r² ) + (3/4 k r² ) cos(2θ).

Adding the first two terms, (1/2 + 3/4) is (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (
