Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read through the question and the steps again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? It's a pretty rigid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a specific way. The 1,3-dibromo means there are Br atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, specifically positions 1 and 3.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's usually an elimination reaction. So, I'm thinking this is a dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. Since there are two bromines, maybe it forms a diene? Wait, but wait—the product is a light yellow solid. What's a common product of such a reaction?

Oh right, when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they eliminate twice to form an alkyne. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on positions 1 and 3. Are those adjacent? No, because in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are on different rings, not adjacent. So they can't eliminate to form a double bond, because they're not next to each other. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where each Br leaves, each forming a double bond. But if the starting structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would lead to two double bonds? Or perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a single double bond, but maybe in a different arrangement.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon with four bonds. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on two non-adjacent bridgeheads. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, but that would require a base to abstract a beta hydrogen. But wait, if the Brs are
