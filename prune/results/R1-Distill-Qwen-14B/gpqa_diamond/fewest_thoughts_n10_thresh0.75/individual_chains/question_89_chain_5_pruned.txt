Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR interpretations.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of its bridgehead carbons, specifically positions 1 and 3.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that's an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it probably abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since it's dibromide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but with two bromines on adjacent carbons (if 1 and 3 are adjacent?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on adamantane's structure. Oh wait, in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are actually across from each other, so maybe they are on opposite ends. Hmm. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's eliminating the two bromides, resulting in a diene? Or maybe a single elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I remember that elimination of vicinal dihalides with strong base can give alkenes. But with two bromines on the same carbon, wait no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on different carbons. So when KOH is present, each Br could eliminate, but perhaps it leads to the formation of a bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, making an allene or a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So it's not an alkene; perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, wait, elimination reactions can sometimes form ketones? Or maybe it's an oxidation reaction. Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, maybe it's an elimination followed by a rearrangement? Alternatively, if the structure is such that elimination leads to ring strain relief, maybe it forms a more stable structure with a carbonyl.

Wait,
