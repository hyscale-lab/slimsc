Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So, it's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Then they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, r, per unit range of distance. The options are from r^2 to r^5. 

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So parallax is in arcseconds, and distance is in parsecs. So high parallax means closer stars because they appear to move more as we orbit the Sun.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars varying with parallax. So if the number N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then we can substitute that in. Let me write that down. 

So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So substituting into N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, I think this is asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. Like, when you look at a thin shell at distance r, how many stars are in that shell compared to another shell. 

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be the number per unit volume multiplied by the volume of the shell. Wait, no, maybe it's more about how the number of stars in a particular distance range (like between r and r + dr) depends on r.

Wait, the number of stars in a small volume dr would depend on the density (number per unit volume) and the volume element. The volume element in spherical shells is 4π r² dr, right? So the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr is density(r) * 4π r² dr. 

So if N(r) is the number of stars in that shell, then N(r) ∝ density(r) * r² dr. 

But the problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Let me think. Parallax plx is 1/d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So how does this relate to the number of stars? 

Wait, perhaps it's that the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in the region is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but wait a second. If N is proportional to d^5, then when you look at a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars in that shell would depend on how d^5 changes with d. But wait, the shell's volume is proportional to d² dr, and if the density is proportional to some function of d, then the total in the shell is density times d² dr.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the number in a thin shell, but the number as a function of distance. But the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r?)" So per unit distance, so I'm thinking it's the number per unit distance. 

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. If the number of stars N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance is d^5 per d. So that's d^4. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the change with distance, so maybe they're asking about the differential number, like dN/dr? 

But wait, the question says: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range
