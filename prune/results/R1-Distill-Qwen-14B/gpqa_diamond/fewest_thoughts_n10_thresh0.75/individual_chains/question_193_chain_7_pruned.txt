Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) is proportional to 1 over parallax, something like d = 1/plx. Oh wait, the parsec unit is defined such that 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So yes, the formula d (in parsecs) is 1 divided by plx (in arcseconds).

So if the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5, I need to express this in terms of distance d. Because the question is about how the number changes with distance, not parallax.

Let me write down the relationships I know. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), so plx = k/d, where k is a constant. That means that plx is proportional to 1/d. So plx = 1/d multiplied by some constant, but maybe I can ignore the constant for this proportionality.

So, if N (number of stars) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx with 1/d gives me N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent: (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 over that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Let's write it step by step.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d.

So 1/(plx)^5 = (1/plx)^5 = d^5.

So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, per unit range of distance. Hmm. So perhaps I need to find how dN/d(r) relates to r.

Oh right
