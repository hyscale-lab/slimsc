Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

Okay, the question is about binary star systems and their masses. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods between primary eclipses are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. 

Then, there are some spectroscopic observations about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the RVs have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is that as the stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities change, and the amplitude of these velocity changes (the RV semi-amplitude) can be used to calculate their masses.

The formula I recall involves the mass function, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think. The mass function relates the RV semi-amplitudes to the masses and the orbital period. Oh right, the mass function for each star is (M_2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_1 + M_2)^2 ), but I might be getting some terms mixed up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the relation between the velocities, masses, and orbital period. I remember that in a binary system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So if star A has velocity v_A, star B has velocity v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A, assuming they orbit each other in a circular orbit. Because the center of mass requires that M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B.

So, the ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of their velocities. That makes sense because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's closer to the center of mass.

Wait, but in the problem, the RV amplitudes are given. Those are the semi-amplitudes of the velocity curves. Let me denote for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s, and for system_2, 15 and 10 km/s.

So for system_1, stars have velocities v1a=10 and v1b=5. For system_2, v2a=15 and v2b=10.

So, using the mass ratio. Let's denote the two stars in system 1 as M1a and M1b, and system 2 as M2a and M2b.

In system_1: M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a = 5 /10 = 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 * M1b.

But wait, M1a + M1b is the total mass of system_1.

Similarly, in system_2: M2a /
