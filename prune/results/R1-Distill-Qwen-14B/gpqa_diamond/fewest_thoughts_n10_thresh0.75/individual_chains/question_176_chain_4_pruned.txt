Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, states are represented by vectors that are normalized, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. So I probably need to normalize this state first. Let me jot that down.

The state vector is ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. To normalize it, I need to compute the norm squared, which is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. So that's (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].

Next, there are two observables, P and Q. The operators for these are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.

Operator P has matrix elements:
First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Operator Q has matrix elements:
First row: [1, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -1]

The question is about measuring P first and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm, wait, I think I might have gotten the order wrong. The question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the sequence is first P is measured, then Q is measured after that. But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So, after measuring P, the state becomes an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue measured. Then, when measuring Q, it's done on this new state.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and -1 when measuring Q. So first, what are the possible outcomes when measuring P?

I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because the outcome of the measurement of P will be one of its eigenvalues, and the state will collapse to the corresponding eigenvector.

Let me find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I can solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to notice the structure of matrix P. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors
