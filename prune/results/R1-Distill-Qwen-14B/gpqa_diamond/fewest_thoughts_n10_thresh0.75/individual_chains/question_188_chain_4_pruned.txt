Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma as 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate and choose the right one.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... I think rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. Oh wait, but wait, noâ€”rhombohedral is part of the cubic system if the angles are 90 degrees, but when the angles are different, it's a separate system. Oh right, but in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, so it's a rhombohedral crystal with a cubic lattice but deformed.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. So in a cubic system, the lattice constant a would be the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral system, things are a bit different because the angles are not 90 degrees. So perhaps the lattice constant isn't the same as the interatomic distance anymore. Wait, or maybe in this case, the interatomic distance is along the edges, so a = 10 Angstroms.

Wait, no. Let me think. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a cubic system with a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice constant a. But in a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal or other system? No, rhombohedral is a separate system where all edges are equal, but angles can be different. So in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, and the interatomic distance might not be the same as the lattice parameter a. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the edges, so a = 10 Angstroms. Because if the lattice is rhombohedral, the edges are all the same length, so a = b = c =10 Angstroms
