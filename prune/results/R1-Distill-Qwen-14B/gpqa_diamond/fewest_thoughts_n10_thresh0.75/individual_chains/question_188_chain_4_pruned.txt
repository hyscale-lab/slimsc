Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this crystallography problem. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter. So the edge length 'a' is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ). Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think sometimes it's adjusted based on the type of crystal system.

Since this is a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So the formula simplifies a bit because each angle is the same. Let me write down the formula correctly.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos α)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²)
