Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that gets dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

First, let me visualize the starting materials. A dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is important. The NMR data might help. The 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a distinctive region. 7 ppm is usually aromatic, but anhydrides can have protons in certain environments. Wait, maybe it's a bridged structure with equivalent protons, like in a cyclic anhydride. The 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester or anhydride). 137 ppm is probably a carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene in a dicarboxylic acid. When it dehydrates, the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride bridge. The cis diene would become a double bond in the anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride would have a double bond. So the anhydride's structure would be something like a cyclic structure with the two carboxylic groups connected by an oxygen bridge across the double bond.

Now, when this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, that's a diene. The reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. The anhydride is likely the dienophile here because it has a double bond and electron-withdrawing groups (the two carbonyls) which activate it for the Diels-Alder reaction.

So the dienophile is the anhydride, and the diene is the cyclopentadiene. Diels-Alder adds the diene to the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride parts) and the two methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. So after the Diels-Alder reaction, the product would have a six-membered ring with two ester groups or something similar attached.

But the products have the formula C13H16O3. Let me confirm the molecular formulas. The dienophile (anhydride) comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let me think: the starting dicarboxylic acid would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis-alkene instead of CH2-CH2. So perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH would become HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH dehydrating to the anhydride, but wait, that's a straight chain. Wait, the cis-alkene indicates that the two CH2 groups are double-bonded, so the starting acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, wait. No, the dicarboxylic acid would have a structure where the two carboxylic acids are on either end of a double bond. So like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is a single bond, but the cis-alkene would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, no, if it's a cis-alkene, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's a single bond. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but that would be a trans or cis di-substituted. So when this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. De
