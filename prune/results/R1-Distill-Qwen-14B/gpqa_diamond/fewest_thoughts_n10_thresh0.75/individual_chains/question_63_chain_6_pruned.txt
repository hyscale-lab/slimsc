Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, it must cause a transition to the next possible state. But wait, in diatomic molecules, the energy states are quantized, so the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states when a photon is absorbed. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means the molecule goes to the next higher energy state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational change, but which one has the lower energy difference?

Wait, the options given are all values for momentum. So the photon's momentum is related to its energy. Because for a photon, energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So if I can find the required photon energy, I can find p.

But first, I need to figure out what energy transition the molecule undergoes. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the ground state, which is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. So the next state would either be the first excited vibrational state or the first excited rotational state
