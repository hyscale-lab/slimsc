Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, along with the stability constants for the complexes.

Wait, stability constants, right. Stability constants (beta) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher beta means the complex is more stable because it's harder to break apart. So the complexes with higher beta will dominate in the solution.

Let me jot down the given information:

- [Co(II)] total is 1e-2 M. But wait, that's the total concentration of all Co species, right? Because when thiocyanate (SCN-) is added, Co forms various complexes.

- [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. That's the concentration of the free thiocyanate ions.

The stability constants (β) given are for the different complexes. Let me list them:

β1 = 9 (probably the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]+)
β2 = 40 (maybe [Co(SCN)2]++)
β3 = 63 (perhaps [Co(SCN)3]^3+)
β4 = 16 (wait, that seems lower than β3. That's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Or perhaps β4 is for a higher complex, but that would be less likely if β3 is higher. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out what each β corresponds to.)

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The stability constant for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) is given by βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^(charge)] [SCN^-]^n). So each β represents how much the nth complex forms.

So the possible complexes are:

n = 1: [Co(SCN)]+ → β1 =9
n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+} → β2=40
n=3: [Co(SCN)₃]^{3+} → β3=63
n=4: [Co(SCN)₄]^{4-} → β4=16?

Wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because higher complexes usually have higher stability constants, but β4 here is lower than β3. So that seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Oh, wait the question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β2 is 40, β3 is 63, which are higher than β1 and β4 is 16.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. So the order of β values is β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β1 (9) > β4 (16?) Wait, no. Wait 63 is the highest, then 40, then 16 is higher than 9. Wait 16 is lower than 40 and 63 but higher than 9. So the order of β is β3>β2>β4>β1? No, wait β4 is 16, which is higher than β1=9. So the order is β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β4 (16) > β1 (9). Hmm, so the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ with β3=63, then [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} with β2=40, then [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} with β4=16, and the least is [Co(SCN)]^+ with β1=9. That's an unusual trend because typically, higher n might have higher β, but here β4 is lower than β2 but higher than β1.

Wait, but the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands, so n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which has β2=40.

Wait, but wait. I'm supposed to find the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes (so n=2) among all Co species. So that includes [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} and maybe any other species that have two SCN attached? Or perhaps that's the only n=2 complex.

But first, let's model the system. The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M. So the sum of all Co species, including [Co^2+], [CoSCN]+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}, equals 0.01 M.

Wait, but wait. The stability constants are for each step. So the formation of each complex is in steps. For example:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9

[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → β2=40

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} → β3=63

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} → β4=16

Wait, but each β is for the nth complex? Or is it for each step?

Wait, perhaps the overall stability constants are given, not stepwise. Or maybe they are stepwise. I think it's stepwise because the way β is presented here is likely the stepwise formation constant. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, sometimes stability constants are given as the overall constant for the complex. For example, for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the stability constant would be βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

In that scenario, the β's are for each possible n, and the higher β means the more stable that complex is. But in our case, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2 (40), which is higher than β4 (16), which is higher than β1 (9). So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^3+.

But in our case, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2). So I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} form.

To do this, I think we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN.

The general approach for such a problem is to compute the fraction of each complex in solution, which depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ion.

The key equation is the distribution of Co between the different complexes. The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_m * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m) for all m)

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because each β is the stability constant for the nth complex, which is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But wait, the total Co is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus free Co^2+.

So, total Co = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n]

But that's probably going to be a complicated equation because it's a system with multiple variables. So perhaps an alternative approach is to assume that the free Co^2+ is much less than the total Co, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, given that the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M, and Co is 0.01 M, the ligand is in excess. So perhaps the formation of complexes is limited by the concentration of Co.

Wait, but since [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and [Co] is 0.01 M, the maximum number of SCN per Co is 4, since 0.01 *4 =0.04 <0.1. So the solution can support up to [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

But regardless, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the relative contributions of each complex.

Let me think again. The fraction of each complex is determined by their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Another approach is to compute the distribution of Co into each complex using the given β values and the concentrations.

Each complex's concentration is proportional to β_n multiplied by [Co]^n / [SCN]^n? Wait, no, because the concentration of each complex is β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n. So the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n] to [Co(SCN)_m] is (β_n / β_m) * ([SCN^-]^{n-m}).

But since all β's are given, we can calculate the relative concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the way to proceed is to compute the ratio of each complex to the first one, and then find the mole fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the stability constants and the given concentrations to find the ratio of each species.

Wait, let's denote the following species:

1. Co^2+ → free ion
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} (n=3)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} (n=4)

The total Co concentration is the sum of all these:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} } = 0.01 M.

But to find the fraction of each species, we can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co^2+].

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^1 = 9 [Co^2+] * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 = 40 [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} = β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3 = 63 [Co^2+] * (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} = β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4 = 16 [Co^2+] * (0.1)^4

Wait, but wait. Wait, the stability constant βn is for each specific complex. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus [Co^2+] equals the total Co concentration.

But this leads to an equation in terms of [Co^2+].

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then, each [Co(SCN)_n] is βn x (0.1)^n.

So total Co:

x + sum_{n=1}^4 βn x (0.1)^n = 0.01.

So x [1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn (0.1)^n ] = 0.01

Let me compute sum_{n=1}^4 βn (0.1)^n:

n=1: 9*(0.1) = 0.9

n=2:40*(0.1)^2 =40 *0.01 =0.4

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Adding these up: 0.9 +0.4 =1.3; 1.3 +0.063 =1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

So sum is approximately 1.3646.

So 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So x * 2.3646 = 0.01 → x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004224 M.

Now, let's calculate each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1: β1 x (0.1) =9 *0.004224 *0.1 =9 *0.0004224 = 0.0038016 M

n=2: β2 x (0.1)^2=40 *0.004224 *0.01=40 * 0.00004224 =0.0016896 M

n=3:β3 x (0.1)^3=63 *0.004224 *0.001=63 * 4.224e-6 ≈ 2.66067e-4 M ≈ 0.000266067 M

n=4:β4 x (0.1)^4=16 *0.004224 *0.0001=16 *4.224e-8 ≈ 6.7584e-7 M → very small.

Now, let's sum all these and [Co^2+] to check if it equals 0.01 M.

[Co^2+] ≈0.004224

n=1: 0.0038016 → sum so far: 0.0080256

n=2:0.0016896 → sum: 0.0097152

n=3:0.000266067 → sum: 0.009981267

n=4: ~0.0000006758 → sum ~0.009981943.

Hmm, but the total needs to be 0.01. So 0.009982 is close but not exactly 0.01. Maybe I made an approximation in calculating x.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x more accurately.

Let me re-calculate the sum:

sum = 0.9 (n=1) +0.4(n=2)+0.063(n=3) +0.0016(n=4) = 1.3646.

So x = 0.01 / (1 + 1.3646) = 0.01 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 * x = 0.01 → x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224.

Perhaps I can compute more accurately:

2.3646 = 23646e-4.

So 0.01 is 100e-4.

100e-4 / 23646e-4 = 100/23646 ≈0.004224.

So x is approximately 0.004224 M.

But when I sum all the species, including [Co^2+], it's about 0.004224 + 0.0038016 + 0.0016896 + 0.000266067 + 6.7584e-7 = approx 0.009982 M. Which is about 0.01 M, so the approximation holds.

Now, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 0.0016896 M.

Total Co species is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (0.0016896 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.896% → approximately 16.9%.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back:

Options:
A) 42.3%
B) 25.6%
C) 38.1%
D) 16.9%

So the answer would be D) 16.9%.

Wait, but wait! Is that correct? Because I only considered up to n=4 and assumed that all the complexes are accounted for. But perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the correct β's. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the order is β3 > β2> β4> β1.

Hmm, but in my calculation, the [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} is 0.000266 M, which is 0.0266% of the total. So even though β3 is the highest, it's not the major species because the concentration of SCN is 0.1 M, which is not very high. So the higher β may not dominate if the ligand concentration isn't high enough.

Wait, let me think again. The percentage comes out to ~16.9%, which is option D. But let me think about whether I should have considered the possibility of more than four ligands or if I missed any other factors.

Wait, another point: the calculation I did gives [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} as approximately 16.9% of the total Co. But wait, in the calculation, the sum of all the [Co(SCN)_n] is about 0.009982 M, and the free [Co^2+] is 0.004224 M, which adds up to 0.01 M.

So the percentages are as follows:

[Co^2+]: 42.24% (0.004224 / 0.01 = 0.4224 → 42.24%)

[CoSCN]^+: 38.016% (0.0038016 /0.01 =38.016%)

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}:16.896% (0.0016896/0.01=16.896%)

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}: 0.266% (0.000266/0.01=0.266%)

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}: 0.0006758% (negligible)

So the percentages are:

Co^2+ → ~42.24%

[CoSCN]^+ → ~38.02%

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → ~16.9%

The rest are negligible.

So the percentage of dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the dithiocyanato is n=2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is the dithiocyanato complex the one with two SCN ligands, which is n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is the species we're interested in. So that's 16.896% of the total Co species.

But according to the options, 16.9% is option D.

So the answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ([Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   The stability constant βₙ for a complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]ⁿ⁺ is defined as:
   \[
   \beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{n+}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]
   Using βₙ, the concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]ⁿ⁺ can be expressed as:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{n+}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{n+}] = 0.01 \, \text{M}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for [Co(SCN)ₙ]ⁿ⁺, we get:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co}^{2+}] \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n = 0.01
   \]
   Letting \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ] = x\), the equation becomes:
   \[
   x \left( 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \right) = 0.01
   \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of Terms**:
   Compute \(\sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n\):
   - For \(n=1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
   - For \(n=2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
   - For \(n=3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
   - For \(n=4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)
   Adding these:
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
   \]

4. **Solve for \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ]\)**:
   Substituting into the equation:
   \[
   x (1 + 1.3646) = 0.01 \implies x \cdot 2.3646 = 0.01 \implies x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Concentration of Each Complex**:
   Using \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ] = 0.004224 \, \text{M}\), compute the concentration of each complex:
   - For \(n=1\): \([\text{Co(SCN)}^+ ] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038016 \, \text{M}\)
   - For \(n=2\): \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}\)
   - For \(n=3\): \([\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3+}] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.000266067 \, \text{M}\)
   - For \(n=4\): \([\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 6.7584 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)

6. **Verify Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   Sum all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+ ] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}] \approx 0.004224 + 0.0038016 + 0.0016896 + 0.000266067 + 6.7584 \times 10^{-7} \approx 0.01 \, \text{M}
   \]
   The total matches the given cobalt concentration.

7. **Percentage of Dithiocyanato Complexes**:
   The percentage of dithiocyanato complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]}{\text{Total Co}} \times 100 = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \times 100 \approx 16.896\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, corresponding to option **D**.

Answer: D
