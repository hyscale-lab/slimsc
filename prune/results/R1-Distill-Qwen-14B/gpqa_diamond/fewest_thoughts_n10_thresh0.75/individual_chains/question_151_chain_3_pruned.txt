Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, the state vector is a 3x1 matrix. The observable is represented by matrix P. I need to find the probability of measuring 0 when I measure this observable.

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember that in quantum mechanics, the observable is associated with a Hermitian matrix, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of this matrix. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

But first, I should check if P is a Hermitian matrix. Because observables are always Hermitian. Looking at P's matrix:

First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, is this symmetric? Let's see. The element at (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), and (2,1) is the same. (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, the matrix is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's good.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, right? So I have to find the eigenvalues of this matrix.

Hmm, calculating eigenvalues for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me write down the matrix:

P =
[  0           1/√2      0        ]
[1/√2         0         1/√2     ]
[ 0           1/√2      0        ]

Wait, I think this matrix is symmetric, which I already checked. So the eigenvalues will be real.

Let me denote P as a 3x3 matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ      1/√2      0     |
|1/√2   -λ      1/√2    |
| 0      1/√2    -λ     |

Determinant of this matrix is zero.

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make some observations about the structure of P, which could help me find the eigenvalues more easily.

Looking at the matrix, it's a symmetric, tridiagonal matrix with zero diagonal except for the central element. Hmm, maybe it's a specific type of matrix.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can perform a change of basis or find some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is circulant or something
