Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian plays a big role, especially when dealing with potentials. The particle is moving in two dimensions, so maybe polar coordinates are involved here. Let me think about the form of the potential.

The potential has two parts: the first is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term. The second part is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, I've seen similar terms before in problems where the potential has angular dependence. Maybe this is a case of a two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator or something with a dependence on the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or other operators. Let's think about the angular part. Cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]
= (1/2)k r² + (3k r²)(1 + cos2θ)/4
= (1/2)k r² + (3k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ
Wait, let me compute that again. (3/2)k r² * (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) would be (3/2)*(1/2) = 3/4, so yes, that part is correct.

Combining the terms without the cosine:

(1/2 + 3/4)k r² = (5/4)k r².

Wait, so V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, but if I factor out (k r²/4), I get:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/4) [5 + 3 cos2θ ].

Hmm, interesting. So this looks like a potential that's a combination of a radial term and an angular term. The angular part is proportional to cos2θ, which makes me think of a potential that varies with the angle in a way that depends on twice the angle. That makes me think of the angular momentum squared operator, L², since L² is proportional to the Laplacian in spherical coordinates and includes terms with cosθ and derivatives, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of known potentials. The radial part is a quadratic in r, which suggests a harmonic oscillator. But the angular part complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can analyze the potential by expressing it in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think: in two dimensions, polar coordinates (r,θ) can be converted to Cartesian (x,y) via x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ
