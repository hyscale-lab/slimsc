Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

The question involves three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each reaction is a Michael addition, and we need to find the correct products from the given options.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

First, I need to figure out which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile here. Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate ion. The enolate is a strong nucleophile. The other component, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)2) would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the actual structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh, right, so the substituents on the double bond are in the E configuration. The structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3, but wait, let me correct that. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate means CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position? Hmm, I might need to visualize this.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but in E configuration. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it out mentally: the double bond is between C2 and C3. So positions would be 1 (CH3O), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH-p-tolyl) and 4 (COOEt?), no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C-p-tolyl)CO-OCH3. No, I think the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is at the 3 position. So the carbon chain is:

CO-OCH3 is the carbonyl, then the next carbon is CH2 (position 2), and then CH(p-tolyl) (position 3), connected by a double bond between 2 and 3. So, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CH2CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Not sure, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I'll just proceed.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate (CH2(CO2Me)2-) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. So, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor. The attack would add the malonate's enolate to the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

After the attack, the product would have the malonate's group (two methyl ester groups) attached to the position where the attack happened. So, the product would be a larger molecule with the malonate's part connected to the p-tolyl group and
