Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

The problem has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each producing a product. The options give possible products for each, labeled A, B, and C. I need to figure out the correct products for each reaction and then match them to the options.

Let me start with the first reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Hmm, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So I think this is a deprotonation scenario, leading to an enolate formation.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile for Michael addition. It's a diethyl malonate derivative, so when it loses a proton, the enolate would form at the beta position. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw the structures. The acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, no, wait a second. The acrylate is the Michael acceptor, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The nucleophile (enolate) would attack the beta carbon of the acceptor.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. So its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. When it forms an enolate, it will deprotonate at the beta position, creating a strong nucleophile. So the enolate would attack the acrylate's beta position.

So the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. When the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 end, assuming the double bond is CH2-CH-C...), wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Hmm, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. So the alpha is the carbonyl carbon (carbon 3), and the beta is carbon 2.

So when the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate), it will attack the beta carbon (carbon 2 of the acrylate). So the enolate's carbanion will attack the carbon adjacent to the
