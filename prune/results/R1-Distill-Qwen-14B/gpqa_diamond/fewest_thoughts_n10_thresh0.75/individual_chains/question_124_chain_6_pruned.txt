Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that when particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, they produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. So, I guess I need to find the Lorentz factor that would cause more particles to reach the walls.

Let me start by recalling what I know. The Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I don't know if I need to calculate velocity here. Maybe I should think about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. Because if they reach the walls, that's when they decay or something? Or maybe not—since the problem says they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities and reach the walls, perhaps it's about how much of their path is within the detector before decaying.

Wait, but the problem states that one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, perhaps the decay length is a factor here. Decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. So, if the decay length is longer, the particle is more likely to travel further before decaying.

But wait, maybe the fraction that reaches the detector walls depends on the ratio of the decay length to the radius of the detector. Because if the decay length is much longer than the radius, a higher fraction would reach the walls.

So, let me formalize this. Suppose R is the radius of the detector (30 meters). The fraction f of particles that reach the walls would be f = 1 - e^(-R/L), where L is the decay length. Wait, wait, no, that's for a uniform decay probability along the path. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

If the particle is produced at the center of the sphere, it can move in any direction. The maximum distance it can travel before exiting the detector is R. So, the probability
