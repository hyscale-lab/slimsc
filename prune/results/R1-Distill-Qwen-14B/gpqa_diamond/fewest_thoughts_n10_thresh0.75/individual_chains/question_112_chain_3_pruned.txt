Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a given operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of this operator.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what the operator looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, probably for spin-1/2 particles. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would make it:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. If i is different from j, A_ij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, positions (1,2) and (2,1) are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0   ]

Wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2.

But wait, no, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are the same as ħ/2 times the eigenvalues of σ_x. So yes, +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but for an operator, the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>. So perhaps we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, the operator A could be written as (ħ/2)(σ_x), so its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. Therefore, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, we need to project |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates and find the squared magnitude.

But first, we need to normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the inner product: <alpha|alpha>
