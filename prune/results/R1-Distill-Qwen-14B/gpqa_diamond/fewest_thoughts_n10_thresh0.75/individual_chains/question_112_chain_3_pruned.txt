Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some operators. Let's see.

The state alpha is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the standard basis for spin-½ particles. Since the state is proportional, I probably need to normalize it first.

Wait, normalization. The state is in the form a|up> + b|down>. The norm squared is |a|² + |b|². Let me compute that. a is (1+i), so |a|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |1 + i|² = (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 2, since (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2. Oh wait, wait, (1+i) times (1-i) is 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. So yeah, |1+i|² is 2.

Similarly, b is (2 - i). So |b|² is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. Because (2 -i)(2 +i)= 4 + (i)(-i) =4 +1=5. So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7) to normalize.

So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator with matrix A. Let's think about operator A. Its matrix elements are given as Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix because it's spin-½, right?

Wait, for a spin-½ system, the basis is two-dimensional, so the operator matrix is 2x2. So A is:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2
