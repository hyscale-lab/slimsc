Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. There are five planets, each with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All the planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation. The question is specifically asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, right. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = T0 * ( ( L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) )

But wait, another way to write it, when considering the Sun as the star, is Te = T_sun * sqrt( R_sun / (2a) ), but wait, that's when comparing to Earth's temperature. Or another version I've seen is:

Te = ( L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4 )

But since all these planets are around the same star, L and σ are the same for each. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (1/a²), which is 1/(a). Wait, no, because (1/a²) under a square root becomes 1/a. So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) )

But wait, the star's temperature and radius would affect this. But in this problem, all planets are around the same star, so R_star and T_star are the same for all. So the temperature ratio would depend on the square root of (1/a), because when you take a bigger a, the temperature would be lower.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = ( ( L ) / (16 π σ a² ) )^(1/4 )

But L is the luminosity of the star. For the same star, L is the same for all planets. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) which is (1/a)^(1/2) or 1/sqrt(a). So if planet A has a semi-major axis a_A and planet B has a_B, then the ratio Te_A / Te_B = sqrt( a_B / a_A )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's see:

Te is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), so Te ~ 1/sqrt(a). So if a increases, Te decreases.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula. For a planet at distance 'a' from the star, the equilibrium temperature (assuming zero albedo, which it's not, but albedo is the same for all, so it cancels out) is given by:

Te = T_eff * ( ( R ) / (2a) )^(1/2 )

Wait, T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius. So if all planets are around the same star, R and T_eff are the same. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(1/(2a)).

Wait, but since 2 is a constant, the ratio between two planets will only depend on sqrt(1/a), which is same as 1/sqrt(a).

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2 is Te4 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so higher a means lower Te.

But wait, I need to get the ratio of Te4 to Te2. So Te4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), Te2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So the ratio is (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So to find this ratio, I need to find a2 and a4.

But the question gives the orbital periods in a certain ratio. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods of Planet 2 is 2, Planet 4 is 3.5.

But Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So (P^2) ∝ a^3.

So the ratio of a's is ( (P1 / P2) )^(2/3 )

Wait, no. Let me think. For two planets, P1 and P2, their semi-major axes a1 and a2 are related by (a1/a2) = (P1/P2)^(2/3) multiplied by ( (M_star + mass_planet) / M_sun )^(1/3 ), but since the mass of the star is much larger than the planet, we can approximate it as (P1/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) a³, so a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * a1

But in this case, the periods are given as a ratio. Let's assign the periods as P1 = 1 unit, P2 = 2 units, P3 = 2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5.

So for any two planets, say Planet_i and Planet_j, their a_i and a_j are related by (a_i/a_j) = (P_i / P_j )^(2/3 )

So for example, a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) a1 = (2/1)^(2/3) a1 = 2^(2/3) a1.

Similarly, a4 = (3.5/1)^(2/3) a1.

Wait, but let me make this clear.

We can write a_i = a1 * (P_i / P1)^(2/3 )

So for Planet_2, a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3 )

For Planet_4, a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3 )

So the ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3 )

Because a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3 ), a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3 )

So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3 )

So the ratio of Te4/Te2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Wait, no, earlier I said Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Yes, because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so Te4/Te2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) )= sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So let me compute (a2/a4) and take its square root.

Compute (2/3.5) = 4/7, because 2 divided by 3.5 is 0.5714...

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (2/3.5) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (a2/a4 ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3 ) = (4/7)^(2/3 )

Wait, because a ratio is (2/3.5)^(2/3 )

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7, then raise that to the power 2.

So compute (4/7)^(2/3 )

Alternatively, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Compute the cube root of 0.5714: approximately 0.830 (since 0.83^3 is about 0.571). Then square that: 0.83^2 is about 0.6889.

Wait, but let me be precise.

Let me compute log(4/7) to base 10.

4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

log(0.5714) ≈ -0.243.

Multiply by 2/3: -0.243 * 2/3 ≈ -0.162.

10^(-0.162) ≈ 0.69.

So (4/7)^(2/3 ) ≈ 0.69.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.69.

Then sqrt( a2/a4 ) is sqrt(0.69) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, because (a2/a4 )^( ) is 0.69. So sqrt(0.69) is around 0.83.

Wait, wait wait. Let me clarify. The ratio Te4/Te2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Which is sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) )

Wait no, a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3 ), which is (4/7)^(2/3 ), as I had earlier.

So the sqrt of that is [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2 )= (4/7)^(1/3 )

Wait wait wait, so I've made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

But a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3 ) = (4/7)^(2/3 )

So sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3 )

Which is cube root of 4/7.

So 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Because 0.83^3 is about 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 is approximately 0.571.

So cube root of 0.5714 is 0.83.

So Te4/Te2 = 0.83.

Wait, but wait, the options given are A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75.

Wait, so the ratio is 0.83, which is option C.

But wait, let me go through that again.

Alternative approach:

Let me think in terms of the formula.

Te = ( ( L ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

So Te is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2)

So Te ∝ 1/√a.

So for two planets, the ratio Te4/Te2 = (a2 / a4 )^(1/2 )

Wait, no, because Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So Te4 = k / sqrt(a4), Te2 = k / sqrt(a2). So the ratio Te4/Te2 = [k / sqrt(a4)] / [k / sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4)

Yes, that's correct.

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So let's compute a2 and a4.

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3 ), because a ∝ P^(2/3 )

So a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3 ) * a1

Similarly, a4 = (P4/P1)^(2/3 ) * a1

So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3 )

Because ( (P2^(2/3) a1 ) ) / ( P4^(2/3) a1 ) ) = (P2/P4)^(2/3 )

So a2/a4 = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3 ) = (4/7)^(2/3 )

Wait, same as before.

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) )

Which is the same as (4/7)^(1/3 )

Because sqrt( x^2/3 ) is x^(1/3 )

So (4/7)^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planets are around the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for all planets. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to the orbital period \(P\) raised to the power of \(2/3\):

\[
a \propto P^{2/3}
\]

Given the orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_2 (\(P_2 = 2\)) and Planet_4 (\(P_4 = 3.5\)):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{2}{3.5}\) to \(\frac{4}{7}\), so:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}
\]

To find \(\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}\), we compute:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \(\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}\), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
