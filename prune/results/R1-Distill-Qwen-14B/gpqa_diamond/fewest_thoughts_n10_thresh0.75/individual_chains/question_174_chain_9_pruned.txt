Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, called T1, and then find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the approximation using classical (non-relativistic) physics.

The options are A to D, with differences in MeV. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll outline what I remember. In nuclear fission, the nucleus splits into two or more parts, and there's usually some energy released because the binding energy is higher in the products. But in this case, the sum of the rest masses is less than the initial mass because some mass is converted into energy, but wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So M_initial is 300 GeV, which is 300,000 MeV. Wait, no, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 300 GeV is 300,000 MeV. But wait, no, the rest mass is given as 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV/cÂ².

The two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M. So their rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. That means the mass-energy difference is 300 -297 =3 GeV. So 3 GeV is the energy released, which would contribute to the kinetic energy of the fragments. But wait, relativistic mechanics, so we have to consider conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me think about the masses. Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says m1 is twice m2. So m1 = 2 * m2
