Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves the scattering of particles where the kinetic energy isn't lost, so it's elastic. But the question is about phase shifts and calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. 

The given data are phase shifts: δ₀ = 90 degrees, δ₁ = 67 degrees, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and the rest are ignored. The incident electrons have 50 MeV of energy. And the task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D with some numbers in fm.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on scattering amplitude formulas. Let me think. So, scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics is often represented as f(θ), and it has real and imaginary parts. For elastic scattering, I think the imaginary part might relate to the phase shifts.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude can be expressed using partial waves. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] ) * ( sin(k r cosθ) / r ), but wait, maybe that's the Born approximation or something else. Or wait, no, perhaps for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part is given by a sum over the phase shifts.

Wait another thought: the optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = 4π |f(0)|², but wait, no, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is the imaginary part of something. Oh right, the theorem says that the total cross-section is equal to - (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of f(0), where f(0) is the scattering amplitude at zero angle (forward direction).

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The optical theorem is ∫ |f(k,θ)|² dΩ = 4π (k/(2m)) |f(0)|² + ... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the forward scattering amplitude f(0) has an imaginary part related to the total cross-section. The formula is Im f(0) = (k/4π) *
