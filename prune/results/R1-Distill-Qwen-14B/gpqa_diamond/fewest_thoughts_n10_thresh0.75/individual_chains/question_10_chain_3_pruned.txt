Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to compare the density of each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth's mass is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg. Its radius is roughly 6,371 km. The density would be mass/volume. Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So option a has the same as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's interesting. So the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. But the mass is double. But wait, since density is given, maybe the volume is different. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, if density is 5.5, same as Earth, then regardless of mass, as long as the composition is similar, the density would be similar. So option b's density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because density is based on the material. So if it's same as Earth, density remains around 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait... the mass is more, but the radius would be bigger too. Because if mass increases, and composition is same, the radius would increase. Oh wait, because volume is proportional to radius cubed. So if the mass increases by a factor, the radius would as well. So the density, being mass/volume, would stay the same. So option c's density is same as Earth, 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density. 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me read the options again. Option b says a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So that's given. So all the others have same composition as Earth, meaning same density. So option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth. So why is the question asking which has the highest
