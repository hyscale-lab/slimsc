Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton chain. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, pp-III involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into carbon-12. But wait, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the overall neutrino flux?

Neutrinos in the Sun are mainly produced by the beta decay steps in the proton-proton chain. The pp-I and pp-II branches are more dominant, I think. Or wait, pp-III is a part of the chain, but it's not the main one. So if pp-III stops, how does that affect the neutrino production?

Wait, neutrinos come from different processes. The dominant ones are the electron neutrinos produced in the beta decays. So the main sources are the pp-I and pp-II branches. Because the question says that only the pp-III branch stops, all other reactions (like pp-I and pp-II) continue as before. So, the production of neutrinos from the pp-III process would stop, but the others would remain.

What's the typical time it takes for changes in the Sun's core to affect the Earth? Oh right, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the light travel time from the Sun is about 8 minutes. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from the core would have already reached us. Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos from that process would have stopped reaching us, but the others continue.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in different layers. The pp-III occurs in the core, maybe at a higher temperature than the outer layers. But the main pp-I and pp-II are in the outer core? Not entirely sure, but I think the pp-III is the main source of higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The
