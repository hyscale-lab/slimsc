Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, I think mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context. Hmm, maybe I can ignore mass for now, unless it's a trick. 

The key points are that both stars' brightest wavelengths are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. Oh right, because according to Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are same, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, so T1 = T2.

They also mention radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 700 km/s. But how does radial velocity affect luminosity? I remember that radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but since they've already determined the peak wavelengths (and that both are the same), maybe the velocity affects the observed temperature? Wait, no. Because if a star is moving towards us or away, the observed wavelength would shift, but the peak as seen in their data would be the same. Hmm, maybe the actual temperatures are the same, but their velocities could change the observed luminosity? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so perhaps the velocity affects the brightness due to Doppler shifting of the emitted light. Like, if a star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, which might make it appear brighter in certain wavelengths, but overall, I'm not sure. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by some factor. So the question is about calculating that factor. Luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power, right? Because L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, but wait, the stars are at different velocities. Does that affect their observed luminosity? Or is the calculation done without considering velocity? Hmm, the problem says to compute the luminosity using black body radiation, so perhaps we're only considering intrinsic luminosity, not the observed. Or maybe the velocities are a red herring.

Wait, the problem states they computed the luminosity using the black body formula. So perhaps the velocities don't directly factor into the calculation of intrinsic luminosity. Because, in that case, L is (R^2)(T^4), assuming same σ and 4π, which cancels out when taking the ratio.

So, since R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (because λ_peak same), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 term is 1, so L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be
