Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using transits. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 orbits its star faster. Also, their host stars have the same radius, but the host of Planet_1 is more massive (twice as much as Planet_2's star). Wait, same radius but different masses—that's interesting because more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe they're similar in radius because one is evolved. Oh, right, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's starting to expand but hasn't yet like a red giant or something. So both stars have the same radius.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability (p) of a transit is roughly (R_planet + R_star)^2 / (a^2), but wait, maybe it's (R_planet / (a)) squared, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's simpler. So maybe just (R_planet + R_star) / a, but squared? Or perhaps the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a) * something.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2)^1.5), but since e=0, it's (R_s + R_p)^2 / a². But wait, another thought: the probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbital plane. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the radius of the star to the radius of the orbit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)))
