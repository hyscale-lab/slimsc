Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Let's break down the problem.

First, the star's parameters: it has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature of the photosphere.

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, so the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-infrared or maybe the optical range. But more importantly, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength of the transition.

Oh right, the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So let's note that down.

But wait, the transition corresponds to this wavelength. So the photon emitted (or absorbed) has energy E = hc/λ. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So putting it all together. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the statistical weights ratio (g1/g2). But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Spots mean the overall T is lower, so T decreases.

Wait, the ratio without spots (ratio1) versus with spots (ratio2) is what we're looking for. Ratio1 = (n1/n2)_no_spots, Ratio2 = (n1/n2)_with_spots. The factor is Ratio1 / Ratio2.

So the ratio depends on T as exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ), because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since denominator is smaller), so the ratio increases. But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Hmm. Let me
