Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is. The options are all different esters, either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the NMR data provided. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). I remember that in esters, the structure is usually R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or alkenyl groups. The groups attached to the oxygen and the carbonyl can show up in the NMR in specific ways.

Looking at the 7.0 ppm peak, that's a region where aromatic protons appear. Wait, but wait, the options are all about propenyl or butenyl acetates. Oh, wait, propenyl and butenyl are alkenyl groups, so maybe the protons on the double bond are what's showing up here.

Let me think about the splitting. The first peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling, which suggests it's between two protons that are on neighboring carbons connected by a double bond. Because in a double bond, each proton is trans to the other, so if it's a trans double bond, the coupling might be different than in a cis.

Wait, but wait, the second peak is at 5.5 ppm, and it's a doublet of quadruplets? Or is it a doublet with some other splitting. Hmm, the notation is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, it's written as dq, which I think stands for doublet of quartets, but maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet with a quartet splitting, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton. For example, in an ester like propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH2-OAc (but wait, actually, propenyl would be CH2CHCH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond? I'm a bit rusty on the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of each option. Let's see:

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the structure where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents (like the OAc group and the CH2 group) are on the same side. So the structure would be CH2=C(OAc)CH3, but wait, no, because propenyl is three carbons. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but in the ester, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but wait, that's butenyl. Wait
