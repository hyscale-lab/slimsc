Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed by the reaction between calcium ions and EDTA. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong this complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So I'm assuming that the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each Ca²+ binds with one EDTA⁴- ion. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²- (or CaY²-).

But wait, the complex itself is the product of this formation. So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Oh right, that's the expression for the formation constant.

So the problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. 

But wait, what's the initial situation? The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, if there's no dissociation, [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. But due to the dissociation, some Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- ions will be released into the solution. So the actual concentration of the complex will be less than 0.02 M, but I think for this problem, they assume that the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is large. Wait no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the formation constant is very large (5x10^10), which means that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is approximately 0.02 M. So the assumption is that the dissociation doesn't significantly change the concentration of the complex. 

So, the K expression is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). 

But wait, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- will be very low because K is so large. So we can approximate that [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M, and the product [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] is equal to [CaY²-]/K.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write down the equation:

K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]).

So rearranging, [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] = [CaY²-]/K.

But what's the value of [CaY²-] here? Since the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is negligible, [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13.

Hmm. But EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, it's usually in various protonated forms. Oh wait, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, the one that can bind Ca²+ effectively. So, I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA here.

Wait, but in a solution with Ca-EDTA complex, the EDTA is bound up, so the free EDTA is Y^4-.

So, let me think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates slightly:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so the change is x for both [Ca²+] and [Y^4-], right? So:

[CaY²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[Ca²+] = x.

[Y^4-] = x.

So substituting into K: K = (0.02)/(x * x) => K = 0.02/(x²).

But wait, no. Wait, the formation constant K is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So K = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13.

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 times 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2 is 13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning. Another way to approach this is considering that the concentration of the complex is much higher than the product of the ion concentrations, so we can use the approximation that [CaY²-] is approximately 0.02 M.

So the equation becomes:

[Ca²+] = [CaY²-]/(K * [EDTA⁴-]).

Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, since [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴-] are the same (because for each mole of complex, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA⁴- are released), then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA⁴-] = x. So substituting, K = 0.02/(x²).

So solving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13, so x = 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So yes, that's option C.

I think that's correct. The high K means that the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] is very low.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \(K = 5 \times 10^{10}\), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\), is approximately 0.02 M (since the dissociation of the complex is negligible due to its high stability). Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \([Ca^{2+}] = x\), and the concentration of free EDTA ions be \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) (since one Ca²⁺ and one EDTA⁴⁻ ion are released per dissociated complex). Substituting these into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
