Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The question says the concentration is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. Wait, but what exactly do I need to find here?

So the setup is that we have a solution where the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M. Since EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be much lower because of the complex formation. 

I think the formula I need is the one that relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions. The formation constant K is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Oh wait, but in this case, the complex is present, so the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. 

Wait, but the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric probably means that the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with all the calcium. So the total concentration of EDTA would be equal to the concentration of the complex. Because each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA. 

So let me think: the total concentration of EDTA species includes the free EDTA and the complex. But wait, when the complex is formed, the EDTA is mostly tied up in the complex. But the problem gives the K value, which is very large, so the complex is very stable. So at 0.02 M, most of the EDTA is in the complex form.

But wait, we're looking for the free calcium concentration. So when the complex dissociates, it gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be equal to the concentration of the complex, right? No, wait, no. Because the K is the formation constant which is [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's denote [CaEDTA²-] as C, which is 0.02 M. Then, according to the formation constant equation:

K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]) 

But wait, the problem is that the total EDTA is equal to [EDTA⁴-] + [CaEDTA²-], right? Because all the EDTA is either free or bound to Ca²+. But wait, the problem says the solution is stoichiometric. So the moles of EDTA and Ca²+ are in a 1:1 ratio. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total EDTA concentration is 0.02 M as well. Because each complex has one EDTA and one Ca²+.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me clarify: the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. So total EDTA is [EDTA⁴-] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

But wait, the solution's concentration is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex. So that implies that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the initial Ca²+ concentration would have been 0.02 M if all the EDTA is present as CaEDTA²-. But in reality, some of it will dissociate.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is made by dissolving Ca-EDTA salt, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA²- (but wait, EDTA is usually in a different form, like Y^4-). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. Then, the total concentration of EDTA species would be equal to that of the complex because each complex has one EDTA. Or is it?

Wait, no. Because the EDTA can exist in different protonation states. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so maybe it's already in the Y^4- form. So let's assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which can form the complex with Ca²+.

So, the total concentration of EDTA (Y^4-) is the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. So:

[EDTA]_total = [Y^4-] + [CaEDTA²-] 

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. But what about [Y^4-]? If the solution is stoichiometric, that means that the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with all the Ca²+ ions. So, the initial EDTA concentration was 0.02 M, and all the Ca²+ is 0.02 M, but then they form the complex. But that's not correct because if the solution is made by dissolving a Ca-EDTA salt, the concentration would be 0.02 M for the complex, but the EDTA is already tied up in the complex.

Wait, perhaps the total concentration of EDTA is the same as the concentration of the complex. Because each complex has one EDTA. So, [Y^4-] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. But since K is very large, the [CaEDTA²-] is almost all of the EDTA, so [Y^4-] is approximately zero. But that can't be right because if [Y^4-] is zero, the denominator in the K equation becomes zero, which would make K undefined. So, there must be some [Y^4-] present.

Wait, but K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, the majority of the EDTA is in the complex, but a small amount is free.

So, let's write the equations:

At equilibrium, the complex dissociates as:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-

The formation constant K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

We have [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. Let's let [Ca²+] = x, and [Y^4-] = y.

So, K = (0.02)/(x * y) )= 5e10.

But the total EDTA is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = y + 0.02 = EDTA_total. But wait, because the solution is stoichiometric, I think the total EDTA is equal to 0.02 M because that's the concentration of the complex. Or wait, perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving a CaY²- salt, so the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So, [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. The total EDTA would be [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

So, y + 0.02 = 0.02 → y = 0? That can't be right. That would imply [Y^4-] is zero, which is impossible because then the formation constant equation would have division by zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the stoichiometry here. Let me reevaluate. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The total EDTA would be the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. But if the solution is made by dissolving a salt, say CaY²-, then the initial [Ca²+] is 0.02 M, and [Y^4-] is 0.02 M. But upon dissociation, some of it forms the complex.

Wait, no, that's not right. CaY²- would dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4-. Wait, no, CaY²- is the complex. So when you dissolve CaY²- in solution, it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. The complex is CaY²-. So, when you add CaY²- into solution, it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

But that's the opposite of what the problem states. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M CaY²- complex. So, the initial state is that the complex is 0.02 M. Then, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, so we can model it as:

At equilibrium:

[CaY²-] = 0.02 - x (but wait, no, I think this approach is getting complicated). Maybe it's better to consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is free Y^4- and free Ca²+.

Wait, perhaps the formation constant can be used in reverse. The dissociation constant would be 1/K. Let's think about it.

The formation constant K is for the reaction:

Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY²-; K = 5e10.

If the complex dissociates, it's the reverse reaction. The dissociation constant would be Kd = 1/K = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equation is:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-; Kd = 2e-11.

So, at equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4- would be equal because their stoichiometry is 1:1.

Let me denote [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x.

The concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M.

So, the Kd expression is:

Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²-] → 2e-11 = x^2 / 0.02.

So, solving for x:

x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 → x^2 = (2e-11) * (2e-2) )= 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So, x ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, no. Wait sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5 → 2 * 3.16e-7 → 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the math. Kd = 2e-11.

So Kd = x² / 0.02 → x² = Kd * 0.02 → 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7? Because 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7. So option C matches that.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K \). The formation constant is given as \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and free EDTA ions ([Y⁴⁻]) are equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction. Let the equilibrium concentration of both [Ca²⁺] and [Y⁴⁻] be \( x \). The concentration of the complex [CaY²⁻] at equilibrium is given as 0.02 M. Substituting into the dissociation constant expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} \implies 2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
