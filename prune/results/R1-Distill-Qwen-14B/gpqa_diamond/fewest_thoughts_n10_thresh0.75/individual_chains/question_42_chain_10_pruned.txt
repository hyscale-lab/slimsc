Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me some data about their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and albedos. Since all three have the same albedo, that might simplify some calculations.

Wait, the TTV method is used here. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? So it's a technique used to detect exoplanets by analyzing variations in the timing of their transits. But I'm not sure if that directly affects the problem here. Maybe it's just context.

So the equilibrium temperatures: Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of about 1.4. That means T2 is 1.4 times T1. And between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3, so T3 is 2.3 times T2. So overall, T3 is 1.4 * 2.3 times T1. Let me calculate that: 1.4 * 2.3 is like 3.22. So T3 is approximately 3.22 times T1.

The masses are given as Planet1/Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35. So mass of Planet1 is 1.15 times that of Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. Wait, so Mass1 = 1.15 * Mass2, and Mass2 = 1.35 * Mass3. So Mass1 = 1.15 * 1.35 * Mass3. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is about 1.5525. So Mass1 is about 1.5525 times Mass3.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. The question is about orbital periods, so I should think about Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, divided by the sum of the masses of the two bodies (but in the case where the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, the sum is approximately the star's mass).

But wait, in the problem, are all three planets orbiting the same star? I think so, since it's a system of three. So maybe each planet has its own semi-major axis. Let me write down Kepler's third law in more detail.

Kepler's third law: (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M)) ), but when the mass of the star dominates, we can say P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Wait, actually, in the formula, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis
