Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, the key here is to find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that the dip in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is due to the planet blocking some of the star's light. The amount of blocked light depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. The same goes for the spots: when they're facing us, they block some light. But the spots are cooler, so the blocked light is due to their lower brightness, not just their area.

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me clarify. The spots are dark, so when they're in view, the total brightness of the star as observed decreases. The star's effective temperature is given as 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K less, so 5000 K. 

The problem states that the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) ). Or wait, maybe the filling factor is already the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. No, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots cover 0.2 * (π R² / 2
