Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what could that be? Well, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, I'm thinking it's more likely propene because cyclopropane is pretty unreactive towards bromine addition.

So, Compound A is propene (CH2=CHCH3). When propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's probably an addition reaction. Propene reacts with bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B), right? Because bromine adds across the double bond. So A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. The reaction of vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane) with alcoholic KOH typically leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, the two Br atoms would leave, and we'd get propene again, but wait—if the starting material was propene, and after bromination and elimination, would we get the same starting material? I think so. So Compound C is propene again.

Wait, does that make sense? So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr twice, forming propene. So yes, C is propene.

Then, Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Oh, that sounds like a dehydrohalogenation or possibly a cracking reaction, but wait, propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation? No, with red-hot iron, which is a catalyst for some reactions. Wait, propene is an alkene. Passing it through a red-hot iron tube—wait, another possibility is that propene is dehydrogenating, but that's not common. Alternatively, could it be a dehydration? No, because propene is already an alkene.

Wait, another thought: when alkenes are passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's typically a catalytic hydrogenation, adding hydrogen. But propene doesn't usually hydrogenate under those conditions. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but propene is a small molecule and less likely to crack. Oh wait, wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't fit here. Alternatively, maybe propene is being converted into something else. Let me think.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. When B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's an elimination reaction, so the product C is propene. Now, propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for various reactions, but what's the product when propene is treated with such conditions? Maybe it's a dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. If passed over iron, perhaps it's being dehydrogenated to form something else. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: what's the next step? Compound D is formed, which reacts with two strong acids to form E. Then E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F, which reacts with nitrous acid to form G, and G with NaOH gives H.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step and what the compounds are. Let me go step by step again.

1. A (C3H6) is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in CCl4 adds Br across double bond, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

2. B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Vicinal dihalide elimination, so B → C is propene again.

3. Compound C (propene) → through red-hot iron. Maybe it's a hydrogenation, but propene is CH2=CHCH3, hydrogenation would give propane (CH3CH2CH3). So D would be propane.

Wait, but under what conditions? Red-hot iron as a catalyst for hydrogenation? Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration, but propene is already an alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but that would require high temperatures and might break it into smaller alkanes. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of addition or polymerization, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but without a
