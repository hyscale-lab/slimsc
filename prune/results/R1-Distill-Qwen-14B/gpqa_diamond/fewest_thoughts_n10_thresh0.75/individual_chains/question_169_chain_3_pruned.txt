Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me see what the question is.

So, the scenario is a nuclear decay where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two nucleons of flavor B. Along with that, they emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the energy spectrum of E is continuous, with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this scenario.

I remember that in nuclear decays, when particles are emitted, their energy distributions can be continuous or discrete based on the conservation laws and the types of particles involved. For example, beta decay often has a continuous spectrum because the emitted electron's energy depends on the neutron's binding energy.

In the original scenario, two E and two V are emitted. Since the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies are not fixed but can vary. Usually, this happens when the decay emits multiple particles, allowing for a range of possible energy distributions because energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the endpoint Q is the maximum energy that the E particles can have. So, when E is emitted along with another particle V, the maximum energy occurs when all the kinetic energy goes into E, but not necessarily, because both E and V carry away energy and momentum.

Now, in the variant, two V's are replaced by a single massless M. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). Also, because it's emitted in the decay, it would carry away some energy and momentum.

Wait, but in the original decay, how did the E particles have a continuous spectrum? I think it's because the available energy (Q) is shared between the E and V particles. Because momentum has to be conserved, the E particles can't all have the same energy. Each E can have a range of energies, leading to a continuous spectrum.

So, when you change the number or type of emitted particles, that affects the possible energy distribution of E. Let's think about the original case first.

In the original decay, 2A→2B+2E+2V.

Assuming A and B are heavy, their rest mass is much larger than E and V. So, perhaps the decay energy Q is the total available energy. But the E and V are lighter, so their energies would vary.

But when you have multiple particles emitted, like two E's and two V's, the energy and momentum conservation would be more complex. The E particles can't all have the same energy because momentum vectors have to add up to zero (assuming the initial nucleus is at rest). So, the E's have a continuous distribution.

In the variant, the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So, instead of two V's, we have one M. Wait,
