Okay, so I have this question about a quasar's observations and figuring out its comoving distance from Earth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let's think it through.

The question says that observations in near infrared and optical show a peak at 790 nm, and below that, the flux drops. I remember that when we observe objects at high redshifts, their light gets stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if the peak is at 790 nm, the emitted wavelength must have been shorter. Wait, because when light is redshifted, it moves to longer wavelengths. Oh right, so the rest wavelength (what we'd see if the object wasn't moving away) would be shorter than 790 nm if the observed wavelength is 790.

Wait, but how does this relate to the quasar's distance? I think the peak emission in the rest frame is probably in the optical or near-infrared. Wait, the peak is at 790 nm in the near infrared, which is longer than optical. So in the rest frame, the peak might be in the optical, say 550 nm (green light), but due to redshift, it's shifted to 790. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1.

Let me compute that. Observed is 790 nm. Let's assume the rest is, say, 550 nm (visible green). So z = (790 / 550) - 1 = (1.436) -1 = 0.436. So z is about 0.436.

Wait, but maybe the peak is in the optical. Oh, wait, near infrared is longer than optical. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is infrared, but if the quasar emits a lot in optical, then maybe the peak in the rest frame is in optical. So we have to assume the rest frame peak is in the optical. Let me think about quasarsâ€”they emit a lot across the spectrum, but the broad emission lines and the big blue bump are in the UV-optical. So perhaps the rest frame peak is at a shorter wavelength.

Alternatively, maybe in the rest frame, the peak is at around 550 nm, but observed at 790. So z would be (790/55
