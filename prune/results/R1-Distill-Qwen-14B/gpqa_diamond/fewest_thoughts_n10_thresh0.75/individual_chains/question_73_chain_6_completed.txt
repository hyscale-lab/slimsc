Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll probably have to calculate both the relative speed and the total energy to match the options.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just say v_rel = v1 - v2. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))? Let me think. Oh yes, because relativistic addition is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) where u and v are the velocities. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. So the relative velocity of the second with respect to the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Because if we're calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, then the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at v1 and astronaut B at v2 in the same direction, then the speed of B relative to A is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, if v2 > v1, then B is moving faster than A, so the relative speed would be positive. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the frame of reference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it the other way: if I'm in the frame of astronaut A, how fast is astronaut B moving? Since A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, but both in the same direction. So in the rest frame of A, B's velocity is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)).

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)].

Wait, hold on. That gives ( -0.1c ) / [1 - (0.3c^2)/(c^2)] = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) which is approximately -0.1428c. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, but since speed is positive, it's 0.14c. Oh wait, but wait, the negative sign indicates direction. Since B is moving slower than A, from A's perspective, B is moving backwards by 0.1c. Wait no, that can't be right. Because if B is moving at 0.5c and A at 0.6c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/(c^2)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c in the opposite direction. So the relative speed would be approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, that would match options C and D, which have 0.14c. The v_rel part is 0.14c in these options.

Next, the total energy of the system. So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The total energy would be the sum of their energies. The relativistic energy for each is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c:

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c:

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = approx 1.1547 * 3 * m c² = 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Wait, so that's approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc².

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option would be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. I thought v_rel was (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), but actually, wait, when you are in the frame of A, which is moving at 0.6c, you have to find B's velocity. So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c in the lab frame. To find the velocity of B as seen from A, it's (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

So plugging in: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

Then the energies: the first astronaut's energy is 2.5 mc², the second's is about 3.464 mc². Sum is about 5.964, which is 5.96 mc². So option C is the one with E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of the second astronaut with respect to the first is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is positive. Thus, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.

Answer: C
