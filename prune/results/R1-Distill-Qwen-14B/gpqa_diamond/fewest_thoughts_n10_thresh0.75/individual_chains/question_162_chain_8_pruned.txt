Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric in terms of x and y? But it's probably embedded in some higher-dimensional space because of the denominator. Oh right, sometimes these metrics describe surfaces or higher-dimensional objects.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like, it's a model in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, I'm not sure if it's the same as a sphere but with negative radius squared or something. Oh, right, the pseudosphere can be thought of as having a metric similar to the hyperbolic plane but with a specific curvature.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but pseudospheres are two-dimensional surfaces, right? So their area would be something like 4πr², but adjusted for the negative curvature.

Wait, but first, let me look at the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric becomes singular. That suggests that this is a model of hyperbolic space. Because in the Poincaré disk model, the metric has a similar form where the denominator is (1 - x² - y²)^2 or something like that.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²). So wait, here we have 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me factor that denominator: 4 - x² - y² is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So we can write the metric as (32)/(4 (1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks similar but not exactly matching the standard form.

Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But our metric here is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me think in terms of polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r², so the denominator becomes (4 - r²). 

So the metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compare this to the standard hyperbolic metric. The standard one is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but ours is 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - (r²/4))) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

So, in terms of scaling, the standard hyperbolic metric is 4/(1 - r²)^2. If our metric is 8/(1 - (r²/4)) times (dr² + r² dθ²), then perhaps this represents a hyperbolic space with a different curvature.

Wait, the curvature K in hyperbolic space is related to the metric. For the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) dr² + ... and the Gaussian curvature is -1/( (radius)^2 ), right? Wait, the radius is related to the curvature. So in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which is 4(1 - (r²/4)), so the scaling factor is 8/(1 - (r²/4)). Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure how this relates to the curvature.

Wait, another approach: the area element in the metric is given by sqrt(det g) dr dθ. The metric in polar coordinates is diagonal: g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2. Wait, no, wait: determinant of a diagonal matrix is product of diagonal elements, so sqrt(det g) would be sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) ) = sqrt( (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

Wait no, wait: Let me calculate this again. The area element is sqrt( g_rr * g_θθ ) dr dθ. So g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So their product is (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2. So sqrt of that is (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but the area of the entire space would be the integral of the area element over all r and θ. But in the Poincaré disk model, the radius r is limited up to 2, because the denominator becomes zero at r=2. So the integral would be from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π.

So the area A is ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute that. First, the integral over θ is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

Wait, our integrand is [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 [r dr]/(u) = 32 [ (-du/2) ] / u = -32/(2u) du = -16/u du.

So the integral becomes -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 is the same as u goes from 4 (when r=0) to 0 (when r=2).

Wait, let me check: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0. So the limits are from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (-16/u) du = (-
