Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. My task is to determine the major products for each and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be a Claisen or aldol condensation reaction.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize this structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, but wait, wait. The formula says 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh, so at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, perhaps the substituents are at different positions.

Wait, the correct way to name that compound: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So, the cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl meaning position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, plus position 6 has a methyl? Wait no, perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl, meaning that at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (so two substituents), and at position 6, another methyl. So the structure would have the ketone at C1, an ethyl and a methyl at C2, and a methyl at C6. So the substituents around the ring are a bit bulky.

When this reacts with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK, which is a
