Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

First, looking at the reactions:

1. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think that usually, the cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl group. But in this case, the product is an alcohol and a nitrile. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would do... I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw this. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN⁻, but wait, maybe this is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation or some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, butanone doesn't have a good leaving group. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Because a cyanohydrin is when a nitrile and an alcohol group are added to a carbonyl. Right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So the reaction would involve adding CN⁻ to the carbonyl, but that's not possible without some activation.

Wait, but I remember that the cyanohydrin formation typically uses a base to deprotonate the nitrile? Or maybe it's done under acidic conditions. Wait, no, in the presence of acid, the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then CN⁻ attacks, and then another step where water is eliminated? Or maybe it's a two-step addition.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanohydrin would add CN and -OH groups to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- and H+ in some way, the product would have an -OH and CN attached to the same carbon.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A gives the cyanohydrin. So what's the condition for forming a cyanohydrin? I think it's done under acidic conditions. The carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN⁻ attacks, leading to the formation of an intermediate, which then loses a proton to form the alcohol and nitrile groups.

So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B). But wait, let me think. Another possibility is that it's using H2SO4 or something, but in the options, the possible A reagents are H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4 providing H+), NaHSO3, etc.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+ or CH3COOH. Hmm. Wait, H3O+ is essentially an acidic solution, like from HCl or H2SO4. Or, wait, sometimes in such reactions, you can use HCN with H2SO4 or other acids.

Alternatively, if reagent A is H3O+ (like from HCl), that would make sense because the cyanide would be present in solution, and the acid would protonate the carbonyl.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (and water) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. So, the structure is something like OHC-CH2-C(OH)(something)-CN? Or wait, no. Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so it's CH2CH2CN with an OH on the same carbon. Wait, no. Let me think.

The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but that's the product of the first reaction. But the second starting material is a more complex molecule: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, but regardless, the reaction is converting a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

So, the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Now, what reagents can do that?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. Common oxidizing agents include KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the second reaction uses reagent B (which is H2O), but the options are about what B is. Wait, the reaction is:

[2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile] + B (H2O) → [2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid]

Wait, no, the question says that the reaction is with B, which is H2O. So the reagent B is something else, and H2O is part of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me re-examine. The second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reagent B is an aqueous solution, but the question gives that B is H2O, or perhaps B is another reagent, and the reaction is done in H2O.

Wait, no, the way it's written is that reagent B is H2O. So the reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because H2O is a reactant in the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps reagent B is an acid or base that's used with H2O.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, H2SO4 and H2O can hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, wait. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical method is to first hydrolyze to the ammonium salt, then acidify. Or, in some cases, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

In the presence of H2O and an acid, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. So, the reagent B must be an acid catalyst, perhaps HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options:

Option A: B=HCl

Option B: B=CH3COOH

Option C: B=HCl

Option D: B=CH3COOH

In the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the conditions would require an acid catalyst. So reagent B is probably HCl (a strong acid) or something else.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (which could be from HCl, H2SO4, etc.), and in the second reaction, B is HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you need strong acidic conditions. So HCl (a strong acid) is more likely. So B would be HCl.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, which would provide the acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → So first reaction uses H3O+ (which is correct for the cyanohydrin), and second uses HCl (correct for nitrile to acid).

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → Not sure about A, but B is HCl again.

Wait, but let's think again about the first reaction. If the first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ (protonating the carbonyl), then A is H3O+.

So in the options, option A and B have A as H3O+ or CH3COOH.

Wait, but another possibility is that A is NaHSO3. How does that fit in? NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3⁻, which is a weaker acid than H3O+. Maybe that's for a different reaction.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A gives the cyanohydrin. I think the cyanohydrin formation requires acid, so A must be an acid. So options where A is H3O+ or CH3COOH are possible.

H3O+ (option A and B) would be a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid. Which is more suitable for cyanohydrin formation? I think the reaction can proceed under either condition, but in the presence of a strong acid, it might proceed faster.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses HCN with H2SO4 as the acid. But the reagents given are NaCN and A. So A is the acid.

Wait, wait, perhaps the first reaction is an example of the HCN addition (cyanohydrin formation), which is typically done in acidic conditions. So for that, A must be an acid, like H3O+.

So in that case, option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) or option C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl) are possible.

But wait, if A is NaHSO3, what would that do? NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3⁻, which is a weaker acid than H3O+ (since HSO3⁻ is a weaker acid than H2SO4, but in solution, HSO3⁻ can donate a proton). So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, would that provide the necessary acidic environment for the cyanohydrin?

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN (which is a weak acid) and a catalyst. But in the question, the reagent is NaCN, which is a salt providing CN⁻. So perhaps, in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ (from HCl or similar), to protonate the carbonyl.

So back to the options. For the first part, A must be an acid, either H3O+ or CH3COOH. For the second reaction, B must be an acid to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

So option A has B=HCl, which is correct for the second reaction.

So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That would fit both reactions.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options. For example, option D has B=CH3COOH. Would that be sufficient for the nitrile hydrolysis? Probably not, because CH3COOH is a weak acid. Usually, nitriles are hydrolyzed under strong acidic or basic conditions, so using HCl (a strong acid) is more likely.

So the correct reagents for the first reaction are H3O+ (A), and for the second reaction, HCl (B). That corresponds to option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. What if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as reagent A? That would be a weaker acid. Would that still work for the cyanohydrin?

I think the cyanohydrin reaction can proceed under either acidic or neutral conditions, but usually, it's done under slightly acidic conditions. NaHSO3 in solution would provide H+ ions, so maybe it's sufficient. But then the second reaction would use HCl. So, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 and the second uses HCl, that's option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the conditions again.

In the first reaction, the cyanide ion must attack the carbonyl. The carbonyl is usually activated by protonation. So any acid would work, but stronger acids might be better. So if A is H3O+ (strong acid), that's ideal. If A is NaHSO3, which is a moderate acid (HSO3⁻ is a weaker acid than H3O+), it might also work, but perhaps less effectively.

But considering the options, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ (so options A or B), and the second uses HCl (so options A or C).

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is treated with HCl and H2O to form the carboxylic acid.

So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking back, the second reaction's reagent is B, which is given as H2O. Oh wait, no, the way the question is written is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

So the reaction is done in the presence of H2O, but B is another reagent. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood earlier.

Wait, perhaps in the second reaction, the reagent B is an acid, and the reaction is done in H2O. So the setup is: reagent B is an acid, and the reaction uses H2O as a reactant.

In that case, the reaction would involve hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So the reagents are acid (like HCl) and water.

So, the second reaction uses HCl (B) and H2O (as part of the reaction). So, the reagent B is HCl.

Thus, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, where the nitrile ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed, the carbonyl group must be protonated to make it more electrophilic. This requires an acidic environment, typically provided by a strong acid like H₃O⁺. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

In this reaction, the nitrile group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. This type of transformation typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions. H₃O⁺ provides the acidic environment for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl facilitates the oxidation of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for the second reaction. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and insufficient for the oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - Incorrect for the first reaction. NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid than H₃O⁺ and less effective for cyanohydrin formation.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for both reactions. NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
