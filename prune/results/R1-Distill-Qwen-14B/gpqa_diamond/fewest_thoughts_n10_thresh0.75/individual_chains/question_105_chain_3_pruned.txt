Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's start by breaking down what the question is asking.

The problem describes a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations as they come into and out of view. The question says that this situation would look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness variations. So, we need to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same signal in the light curve as the spotted star, assuming the star had no spots.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I think is (Rp/R*)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and R* is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the star's brightness isn't uniform. Without spots, the star emits uniformly at a certain flux. With spots, some parts are cooler and thus emit less. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. But since the star is spotty, the observed flux changes as the spots rotate into and out of the observable area.

The problem says that the observed variations can resemble an exoplanet. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what you'd get from a planet transit. So we need to calculate the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the observed brightness? Let me think. The star normally emits a certain amount of light. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. When the star rotates, more or less of the spotted hemisphere comes into view, changing the total observed flux.

The question refers to a "filling factor" of 20% for the spots. I think the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, and
