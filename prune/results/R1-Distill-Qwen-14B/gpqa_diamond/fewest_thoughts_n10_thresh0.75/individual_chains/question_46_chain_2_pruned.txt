Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I've heard about Grubbs catalyst before. I think it's used in olefin metathesis reactions, right? So metathesis involves breaking and reforming of double bonds, swapping parts of the molecules.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But wait, wait. Wait, for a molecule to have enantiomers, it needs to have a chiral center. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(H)(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. So position 1 is the first double bond. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon.

Wait, actually, the correct structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)(CH3)? No, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, adding a methyl group on C3
