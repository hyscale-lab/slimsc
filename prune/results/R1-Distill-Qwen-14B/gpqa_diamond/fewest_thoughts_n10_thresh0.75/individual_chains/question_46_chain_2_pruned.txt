Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. I think it's a process where the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. But wait, Grubbs is specifically for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Oh right, it's a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, that facilitates the breaking and forming of double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, but in this case, since the molecule is a double bond, I think the racemic part might refer to whether the double bond is in a certain configuration, or maybe it's about the starting material being a racemic mixture. Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself has a stereogenic center that's racemic. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, wait. Let me draw this out.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So,
