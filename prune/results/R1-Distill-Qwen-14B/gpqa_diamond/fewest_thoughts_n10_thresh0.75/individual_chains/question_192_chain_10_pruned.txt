Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the electric field at point P. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding and the method of image charges might come into play.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So initially, without any charge in the cavity, the conductor would have no net charge. But when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, things change.

Wait, according to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. But since the charge is inside the cavity, which is within the conductor, the conductor's interior (the cavity) isn't the same as the conductor itself. So, the conductor's outer surface will have induced charges.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is uncharged to start with. When I place a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor must redistribute its charges. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when +q is inside, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the charge inside the cavity will induce an opposite charge on the inner surface. Then, because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral (since we placed +q inside, but the conductor itself was uncharged), the outer surface must have +q charge. Because the total charge on the conductor is sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner is -q, outer is +q; total is zero? Wait no, the conductor was uncharged. So the total conductor's charge would be the sum of inner and outer. Wait, the conductor was
