Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let's try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the setup is about a spherical conductor with a cavity, right?

So, the conductor is uncharged initially. That means it has no net charge. But then, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. Wait, but the conductor wasn't charged before, so how does this affect the electric fields inside and outside?

I remember that when you have a conductor with a cavity, any charges placed inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Oh right, because the conductor is a good conductor, so the charges will redistribute. Since the cavity is ungrounded, the induced charges on the inner surface will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So the inner surface will have a charge of -q.

But wait, the conductor itself was initially neutral. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, because the total conductor must remain neutral. Oh, right, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So inner is -q, outer must be +q.

Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. The angle between l and s (the distance between the centers) is theta.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize this setup. The conductor is a sphere of radius R, and the cavity is inside it, not centered. Oh, right, the cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity is offset. The radius of the cavity is r, but r is less than R, so it's entirely within the conductor.

Point P is outside the conductor (since L > R), and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Hmm, and the angle between l and s is theta. So imagine the line from the cavity center to P makes an angle theta with the line connecting the two centers.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the conductor is a spherical shell (well, more like a spherical shell for the outer surface), the electric field outside should behave as if all the charge
