Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings, right? So the structure has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction is happening here. Since it's dibromide, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation. But wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. But wait, considering the adamantane structure, which is pretty rigid.

So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form an alkene. The positions would be 1 and 3, so when they eliminate, they lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. But wait, in adamantane, what's the structure? Each carbon is part of multiple rings. Hmm, but maybe the product is a diene or just a single double bond. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's a ring-opening elimination? Wait, no, adamantane is pretty stable, so more likely a double bond forms.

Wait, let me think. When a dibromide is treated with a strong base, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the base (KOH) would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a double bond between C1 and C3. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, actually, is that even possible? Or maybe the product is a mono-alkene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum shows some peaks. Let me look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, that's unusual for elimination, which usually gives alkenes without carbonyls. Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't elimination
