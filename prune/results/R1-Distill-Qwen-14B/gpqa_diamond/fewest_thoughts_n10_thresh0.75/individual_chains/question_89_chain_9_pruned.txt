Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is a cage-like structure. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Wait, but in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, adamantane is a cage structure where the 1 and 3 positions are actually not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on carbons that are two apart in the structure. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, but KOH in such conditions might cause a double elimination, resulting in a diene? Or maybe not. Alternatively, since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base, perhaps it undergoes two E2 eliminations. But wait, E2 typically requires adjacent leaving groups, so maybe that's not
