Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about reactions involving reducing agents and determining the starting materials.

The problem says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the same product but with opposite configurations in each reaction.

Looking at the reagents: the first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+, and the second uses BH3 and H+. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups like ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait, in some cases, in the presence of certain protecting groups, it can do more. Oh, right! For example, in the case of ketones, LiBH4 would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. But when there's an adjacent protecting group like an ether, maybe something else happens?

Wait no, let's think again. Oh wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. That's a cyclic ether with an oxygen in a six-membered ring, like a cyclic hemiacetal or something. Wait, maybe the starting material is a diketone or a ketone with an adjacent group that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, another thought: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a cyclic ether (pyran) with a ketone group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The configuration is R and S in the two cases.

So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, pyranone is more like a cyclic ketone. So let's think about how to form that.

When a ketone is present in a structure that allows for the formation of a ring upon reduction, perhaps a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol or another group that can form an epoxide or ring upon some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the formation of a cyclic ether via an elimination reaction.

Wait, another approach. The product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone
