Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 C, which is 3.2e-19 C. 

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Wait, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I'm pretty sure that for charges, the potential energy is related to their configuration. So, since we're dealing with an isolated system, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But since the charges are constrained, I think their kinetic energy might be negligible or zero because they can't move. Hmm, not entirely sure, but the problem says "minimum energy," which makes me think about when potential energy is minimized. 

Wait, no, in the case of point charges, the potential energy is a function of their positions. Since the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, but the 13th is at P. So the potential energy would be due to the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. 

Wait, but the system is 13 charges. So the interactions would be between each pair where one is at P and the others are around. Let me think about electric potential energy. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988e9 N·m²/C². 

But since there are multiple charges, how do we calculate the total potential energy? Oh right, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So each of the 12 charges at 2 meters will interact with the 13th charge
