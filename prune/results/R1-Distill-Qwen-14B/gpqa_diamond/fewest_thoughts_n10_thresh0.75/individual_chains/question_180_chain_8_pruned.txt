Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since all the charges are the same, and they're arranged in a certain way, the potential energy between them must be considered.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we're probably looking at the electrostatic potential energy between all these charges. Since the system is isolated, maybe we need to calculate all the pairwise potentials.

Let me think about how to approach this. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair. Wait, but how many pairs involve the fixed charge, and how many are between the moving charges?

So, the 13th charge
