Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, there are some exceptions too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if it's meso compound.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure here is probably Cl attached to C1, which is connected to a double bond. Because it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl and a methyl on C1, and maybe a CH2CH3 on C2? Wait, but the configuration is Z, which refers to the geometry. But does that affect chirality? The molecule would have a double bond, and whether it's Z or E doesn't directly cause chirality unless there's a stereogenic center. Let me see: C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl and another substituent. Wait, but for a chiral center, you need four different groups attached. C1 has Cl, double bond (so two substituents on each side?), wait no, wait, but for double bonds, the substituents on each carbon are arranged in a certain way. But for chirality, each carbon in the double bond would have to have four different groups. Let's see: C1 has Cl, and two CH2 groups (since it's but-1-ene, maybe CH2CH2 or something). Wait, actually, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl at the first carbon. So the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. The second carbon has a methyl group and another substituent. So for C1: Cl
