Okay, so, I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the problem says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data includes some abundance ratios: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are both 0 dex. Oh wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So, I can use these to figure out the normalizations.

I remember that the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, is it [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX/nY)_sun))? Yes, that's right. So it's the logarithm of the ratio divided by the solar ratio.

Let me break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe,nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.

Given that the Sun's log(nFe/nH) is 7.5. Wait, no, the question says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 for the Sun. So 12 + x =7.5 → x= -4.5. So log(nFe/nH) for the Sun is -4.5. So for Star_1, log(nFe/nH) is same as Sun, so log(nFe/nH)_1 = -4.5.

Wait, but let me correct that. 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Right.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5.

Next, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that's log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

Hmm, wait, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of (X/Y in star) divided by (X/Y in sun). So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

So for Star_1:

log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3

Which can be rewritten as:

log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But I know that for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) is -4.5. So nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Wait, but for the Sun, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5), so nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_1, log(nFe_1 /nH_1) = -4.5. So nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

So in Star_1, nFe_1 = same ratio as Sun. So for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:

log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But nFe_1 and nFe_sun are the same ratio to nH. So (nFe_1 / nFe_sun) = (nH_1 / nH_sun) ) * (nFe_sun / nFe_1 ) ? Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since in Star_
