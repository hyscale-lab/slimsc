Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. There are two reactions given, and I need to determine the major products for each. The options provided are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products A and B.

First, I'll look at reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reaction mechanisms, but I'll think this through. 

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro atom is likely the oxygen because the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the structure probably has two rings: a three-membered and a five-membered ring? Wait, no, wait. The spiro notation [3.5] implies that the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons each, excluding the spiro atom. So the first ring would be a four-membered (since it's 3 carbons plus the spiro carbon?), or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, the spiro index is the number of carbons in each ring before the spiro atom. So for spiro[3.5], the first ring is a four-membered ring (3 carbons plus the spiro), and the second is a six-membered (5 +1). Or wait, maybe it's the number of carbons in each ring including the spiro? No, I think the notation is the number of carbons in each ring attached to the spiro atom. So, the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons each, plus the spiro carbon. So the first ring would be a 4-membered (3+1) and the second a 6-membered (5+1). 

But wait, the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the main chain is non, which is nine carbons. But because it's a spiro compound, the structure is more like two rings connected at the 1-position. The 1-position has a vinyl group (a double bond) and an OH group. So,
