Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. Let me see what the potential looks like.

The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that's in polar coordinates. I remember that in two dimensions, potentials can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts, which makes solving the Schrödinger equation easier.

Wait, let's break down the potential. The first term, (1/2)k r², looks familiar. Isn't that the potential for a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions? Oh wait, no, wait. A simple harmonic oscillator in two dimensions would be V(r) = (1/2)k r², right? But wait, in two dimensions, the potential might depend on the coordinates, not just r. Hmm.

Wait, no, r is the radial distance, so r² would be x² + y². So V(r,θ) has two parts: (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me see. That can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (1/2)k r² from both terms. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I can combine the terms.

Wait, (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ can be rewritten as (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, but maybe I should think about it in terms of separation of variables. For the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates, the potential is often expressed as a sum of functions that depend only on r and only on θ. But here, the potential depends on both r and θ in a way that's a product of r² and cos²θ.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether this potential can be transformed into something separable. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, which might make the separation more obvious.

Let me think about that. In polar coordinates, x = r
