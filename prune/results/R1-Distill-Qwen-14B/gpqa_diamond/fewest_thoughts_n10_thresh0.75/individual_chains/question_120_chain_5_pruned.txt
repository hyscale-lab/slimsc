Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. The options are various inverse powers of plx. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to recall what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (d = 1/plx), so plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I think about a parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Wait, but the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. So the number density of stars depends on their actual distribution in space. Uniformly distributed probably means that the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, right? So maybe it's about how the volume relates to the parallax.

Let me think about this. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, I can express distance as d = 1/plx. So, as plx increases, the distance decreases. So, a higher parallax means the star is closer.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, where r is the distance. But since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r would depend on the volume of that shell.

Wait, but the question is about parallax, so I need to express everything in terms of plx. Let's see. The volume element in spherical shells is 4πr² dr. So, the number of stars in a thin shell dr is proportional to r² dr. But since r is 1/plx, let's write dr in terms of plx.

Let me do the differentiation. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, which makes sense. But since we're dealing with the number of stars, the absolute value matters.

So, substituting r = 1/plx into r² dr:
