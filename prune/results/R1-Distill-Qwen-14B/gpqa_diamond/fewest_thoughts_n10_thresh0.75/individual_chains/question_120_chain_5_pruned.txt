Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about the distribution of stars in terms of their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Let me think.

Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance d (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Now the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Wait, the number per unit plx... I think this relates to the density of stars in terms of parallax. So more stars would be in certain ranges of parallax.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density (number per volume) is uniform. But when we consider parallax, which depends on distance, the number of stars we observe in a given parallax range depends on how that range translates to distances.

Let me break it down. If I have a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that mean for the distance? Since d = 1/plx, a small change dplx would lead to a change in distance. Let me compute it.

The distance d is 1/plx. So the change in distance dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx. The derivative of 1/plx is -1/(plx^2). So dd = (-1/plx^2) * dplx. Wait, but dplx is positive, so dd is negative, which makes sense because as plx increases, distance decreases.

But how does this relate to the number of stars? The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density (n). The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number N is n * 4πd² dd.

But since we're looking at the number per unit plx, let's express this in terms of plx. We know d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And dd, from before, is (-1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, so when considering the magnitude, it's positive. So N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because the change in d (dd) is -1/(plx^2) dplx. So when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell's thickness is dd = -dplx/(plx²). But the absolute value would be dplx/(plx²). 

So N, the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx to plx + dplx, is proportional to 4π d² |dd|.

Substituting d = 1/plx, d² = 1/plx². And |dd| = dplx / (plx²). So:

N ∝ (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = dplx / plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so N/(dplx) would be proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx interval (i.e., per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm, but that seems a bit steep. Let's think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me approach it differently. The number of stars in a thin shell (d distance) is 4πd² n dl, where dl is the thickness in distance. But because we're dealing with parallax, we need to relate dl to dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, then
