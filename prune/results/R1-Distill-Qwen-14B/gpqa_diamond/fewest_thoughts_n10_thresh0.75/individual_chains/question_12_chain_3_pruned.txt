Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. The equation is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, right, neutrinos are usually denoted as nu, so that makes sense.

The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary. So that means, in the rest frame of the pion, it's not moving. I remember that in such cases, we can use conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Hmm, so let's jot down the knowns. The rest mass of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos have a very tiny mass, but for these kinds of problems, I think we can assume they're massless, especially in high-energy physics. So their rest mass is zero.

So the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have momenta that cancel each other. So their magnitudes are the same, and directions opposite.

Now, the energy conservation equation would be the total energy before decay equals the total energy after. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's not moving. So initial energy E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since it's massless). So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

So E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c^2, and E_nu = K_n
