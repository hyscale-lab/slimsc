Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Alright, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds with ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric means 1:1 ratio, right? So the complex is Ca-EDTA in a 1:1 ratio. So each mole of the complex contains one mole of Ca²+ ions.

The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constant... Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I think I need to relate the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions.

Wait, let's think about the equilibrium. When we have the complex CaEDTA²-, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-   ; Kf = 5x10^10.

So if initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that would be the concentration of CaEDTA²- at equilibrium, assuming that it's the only species present. Wait, but that might not be the case because some of it will dissociate. Oh, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and if it's in a solution where the complex is formed, then the main species is the complex. But I think we need to consider how much of it dissociates. Hmm, because the formation constant is so large, Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much.

So, let's model this. Suppose the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Let's let the change be x. So, the complex dissociates as:
CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kf is so large, x is very small).
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, plugging into the formation constant equation:
Kf = [CaEDTA²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])
5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)
5e10 = 0.02 / x²
So, x² = 0.02 / 5e10
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12 is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5)) )= 2 * (1e-6 * ~0.316) )= ~6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer is C.

Wait, but another thought—what if the initial assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is correct? Because the Kf is so large. So that means the complex doesn't dissociate much, so x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So yes, that assumption holds.

So yeah, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium relationship for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal). Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
