Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some key data about each star and the capabilities of the instruments.

First, let me parse the question. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have certain brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, which means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16. So, a star that is detected by both must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 because that's the stricter condition.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star because some of them are given in absolute terms, and others have extinction factors. Let me go through each star one by one.

Starting with Star1: It has an absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and is at 10 pc distance. I recall that the formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Plugging in the numbers: m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) → log(1) is zero, so m=15.5. Now, since Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16, it's observable by both. Wait, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So Star1 is observable by both, but wait wait, let me check the options. The options don't have Star1 in their correct pair.

Wait, let's check each star:

Star1: m =15.5. Both can see it? Because 15.5 is less than 16. So yes, both can detect it. But let's see the options. The options don't include Star1 in any pair except option D: Star1 and Star4. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.

Star2: It has an apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag, located at 5 pc. Wait, but the question says for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed. So 16.5 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. Because apparent magnitude 16.5 is 0.5 magnitudes beyond HIRES's limit. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES. So it can't be part of the correct answer.

Star3: RA and DEC aren't needed for brightness, but apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but wait, no—it says apparent V magnitude is 15.5 before considering extinction. Wait, no, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag
