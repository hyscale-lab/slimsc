Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's take it step by step. Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some information, and I have to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, let's read the question again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength is the same. That's probably related to their temperatures. Then, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. 

Wait, radial velocity—oh right, that's the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, it's about redshift or blueshift due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength might be different from the emitted one because of the star's motion. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, interesting.

But wait, the peak wavelength depends on the star's temperature. From blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same observed λ_max, but considering their velocities, their actual temperatures might be different.

Wait, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its light would be redshifted. If that's the case, the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be longer than its emitted λ_max. But according to the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So maybe Star_1 is moving towards us, or not moving, but Star_2 is moving away. But wait, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so its observed wavelength is the same as the emitted. Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength would be longer than its emitted. But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So that must mean that Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter than Star_1's. Because when Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its emitted. So if both observed λ_max are same, Star_2's emitted λ_max must be shorter, meaning its temperature is higher.

Wait, let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So if their observed λ_max are the same, that can only happen if Star_2's emitted λ_max (without redshift) is shorter. Because when you redshift a shorter wavelength, you can get the same observed wavelength as a longer emitted wavelength from Star_1 without any redshift. For example, imagine Star_1 emits λ1, observed λ1 (since no motion). Star_2 emits λ2, which when redshifted becomes λ_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c). Since λ_obs is same as λ1 for Star_1, we have λ1 = λ2*(1 + v/c). So λ2 = λ1 / (1 + v/c). 

Since the wavelength and temperature are inversely proportional (λ_max = b/T), the temperatures are inversely proportional to λ_max. So T1 = b/λ1, T2 = b/λ2. So T2 = T1 * (λ1/λ2). But λ2 = λ1/(1 + v/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c).

Wait, but v is 700 km/s. Let me compute that. The speed of light c is about 3×10^5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333... So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333. So T2 is T1 multiplied by approximately 1.002333. So T2 ≈ 1.002333 * T1. That's a small increase, but maybe it's significant for the calculation.

Wait, but what if the problem neglects the Doppler shift? Because 700 km/s is small compared to c, so maybe the effect is negligible. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps I can't ignore this.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So I can't ignore the Doppler effect when calculating the temperatures.

So to find the temperatures of each star, I need to consider their velocities. Let's model this.

For Star_1: radial velocity is zero, so observed wavelength λ1_obs = λ1_emit = λ1.

For Star_2: radial velocity is 700 km/s away, so observed wavelength λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c). 

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so λ1 = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c). 

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature, so λ1 = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting: (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, no. Let me re-arrange: 1/T1 = (1 + v/c) * (1/T2) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So T2 is higher than T1 by (1 + v/c) factor.

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed λ_max is longer. If Star_1 is stationary, and Star_2 is moving away, but their observed λ_max are same, then Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength (so higher temperature) to have its redshifted wavelength equal to Star_1's emitted. So T2 is higher, which aligns with the calculation.

So now, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) → which is approximately T1 * 1.00233.

But wait, v is 700 km/s. Let me compute v/c accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/(3000) = 0.0023333...

So (1 + v/c) = 1.0023333...

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

But wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_2 must emit a shorter wavelength (so higher temperature) such that when it's redshifted, it matches.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the next step is to compute the luminosity of each star.

The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

Wait, wait, more accurately, L is the total power emitted, which for a star is approximated as L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So for each star, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

We can take the ratio L1/L2.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given, R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) → T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, wait no. Wait, earlier we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, no, wait: I had earlier

λ1 = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c)

But λ1 = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c) → 1/T1 = (1 + v/c) * (1/T2) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So T2 is higher than T1. So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, no, let's re-express that. 1/T1 = (1 + v/c) * (1/T2) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So T2 is higher.

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

So, substituting T1 into the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Since R1 = 1.5 R2, R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c) → T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c).

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) = [1/(1+ v/c)]^4.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.

Since v/c is 0.002333, (1 + v/c) is about 1.002333.

So 1/(1.002333) is approx 0.99768.

But to compute [1/(1.002333)]^4, I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1 + v/c) = 1.0023333333.

So 1/(1.0023333333) is approximately 0.997676.

Then, raising that to the 4th power:

(0.997676)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute step by step.

First, let's compute ln(0.997676) ≈ ?

ln(1) = 0. ln(0.997676) ≈ -0.002333 (since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x, and x here is 0.002333).

So ln(0.997676) ≈ -0.002333.

Multiply by 4: ln ≈ -0.009333.

Now, exp(-0.009333) ≈ 1 - 0.009333 + (0.009333)^2/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.99076.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute (1 - 0.002333)^4.

Wait, 1.002333 is 1 + 0.002333.

So 1/(1.002333) = 1 - 0.002333/(1) + (0.002333)^2/(1)^2 - ... 

But for small x, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... 

So x = 0.002333.

1/(1.002333) ≈ 1 - 0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.002333 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99767244.

Then, (0.99767244)^4.

Another approach: compute (1 - 0.002333)⁴.

Using binomial expansion:

(1 - a)^n ≈ 1 - n a + (n(n-1)/2) a² - (n(n-1)(n-2)/6) a³ + ... where a = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

1 - 4a + (4*3/2 ) a² - (4*3*2/6) a³ + (4*3*2*1/24) a^4.

Compute each term:

a = 0.002333.

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: -4a = -4 * 0.002333 ≈ -0.009332.

Term 3: (12/2) a² = 6 a² → 6*(0.002333)^2 = 6*(0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264.

Term 4: -(24/6) a³ = -4 a³ → a³ is (0.002333)^3 ≈ 1.27e-8 → 4 * 1.27e-8 ≈ 5.08e-8 → so term is -5.08e-8.

Term 5: (24/24) a^4 = a^4 → (0.002333)^4 ≈ 3.17e-11 → negligible.

So summing up:

1 -0.009332 + 0.00003264 - 0.0000000508 ≈

1 -0.009332 = 0.990668.

+0.00003264 → 0.99070064.

-0.00000005 → 0.99070059.

So approximately 0.9907.

Thus, (1/(1.002333))^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So back to L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total approx 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Wait, but wait, that's about 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

But looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, the calculation is approximately 2.229, which is very close to 2.23.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the T ratio.

Wait, when I took T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), and then substituted into L1/L2.

Wait, let's double-check the substitution.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But T2 = (1 + v/c) T1 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

So T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1 + v/c)^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4.

Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 )

Wait, no, wait, wait. Because (R1²/R2²) is (1.5)^2=2.25. And (T1^4 / T2^4) is (T1/(T2))^4 = (1/(1 + v/c))^4.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.229.

But wait, earlier calculation of [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 0.9907, so 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

So that's approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, but another thought: maybe I got the temperature relation wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine the Doppler effect and the temperature.

The observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), when the source is moving away.

So if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c).

But the observed λ_max for both is the same, λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

Star_1 isn't moving, so λ_emit,1 = λ_obs,1.

So λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c) = λ_emit,1.

But λ_emit,1 = b / T1.

λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

So substituting:

(b/T2) * (1 + v/c) = (b/T1)

→ 1/T2 * (1 + v/c) = 1/T1 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, I think I messed up earlier. So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So T2 is higher, which is consistent with what I had earlier.

So for the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = [ (R1/R2)^2 ] * [ (T1 / T2 )^4 ]

R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = [ T1 ] / [ (1 + v/c) T1 ] = 1/(1 + v/c).

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 ) ≈ 2.25 * (1/ 1.00941) → wait, wait, because (1 + v/c) is 1.002333, so (1 + v/c)^4 is approximately (1.002333)^4.

Wait, wait a second. Earlier I thought [1/(1.002333)]^4 is 0.9907, but perhaps I should compute (1.002333)^4 instead.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the ratio is [1/(1.002333)]^4. Or is it (1 + v/c)^4?

Wait, no. Let me recompute.

Because L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * ( [T1/(T2)]^4 )

But T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c), so T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c).

So [T1/(T2)]^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.

So (1 + v/c) is 1.002333, so [1/(1.002333)]^4 is approximately 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the relationships for blackbody radiation and the Doppler effect.

### Key Information:
1. **Radii**: Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
2. **Masses**: Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2, but mass is not directly relevant to luminosity in this context.
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).
4. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 (stationary), and Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (moving away).
5. **Luminosity Formula**: For blackbody radiation, \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature by Wien's Law:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T},
\]
where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. For Star_1 (stationary), \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \).  
For Star_2 (moving away), the observed wavelength is redshifted:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c),
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light. Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate:  
\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v/c).
\]
Simplifying,  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c).
\]

### Step 2: Substituting \( v/c \)
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus,  
\[
v/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333.
\]
So,  
\[
1 + v/c \approx 1.002333.
\]
Therefore,  
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Taking the ratio of luminosities:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \),  
\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]
For the temperature ratio,  
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v/c} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997676.
\]
Thus,  
\[
\left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx (0.997676)^4.
\]
Using the binomial expansion or direct computation:  
\[
(0.997676)^4 \approx 0.9907.
\]
Finally,  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated ratio \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.229 \) is closest to option **D) ~2.23**.

### Final Answer:
Answer: D
