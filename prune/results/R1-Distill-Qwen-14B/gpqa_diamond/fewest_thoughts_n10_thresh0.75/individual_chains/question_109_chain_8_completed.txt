Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like two protons or a proton and neutron) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. And we're told that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, wait, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2, right?

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So plugging that into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd, meaning their sum is 1. So S and L must be different: if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options involve different transitions from the initial 1S0 state to some other state plus a particle (X). Each option shows the initial state, the final NN state, and the emitted particle's state.

The options are:

A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the notation is here. The initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L J? Or is it (2S+1)L, and J is given as the total angular momentum? Oh wait, the note at the bottom says the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so the initial state is 1S0. So S is the total spin, L the orbital angular momentum, and J the total. So 1S0 implies 2S+1 =1, so S=0. L is S (wait, no, S is spin, L is orbital. Oh wait, no, the initial state is 1S0. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. Wait, S here is the orbital angular momentum? No, wait, no: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin. Wait, no, that's confusing. Wait, the note says, for example, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum. So in the initial state, the term is 1S0. So 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S, which in this case, wait no, in the term symbol, the 'L' part is the orbital angular momentum, right? So for 1S0, the L is 'S', which is 0. Wait, no, S is the spin, and L is the orbital part. So for 1S0, S is 0, L is 0? Because S is the spin, and the L is the orbital part. So initial state has S=0, L=0.

Wait, but when the nucleons are in a 1S0 state, that would mean their combined spin is 0 and their orbital angular momentum is L=0? Or is that the case? Hmm. Maybe I should think about the initial state's quantum numbers.

Initial state: 1S0. So the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So S is the total spin, L the orbital angular momentum. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 → S=0. And L is the letter corresponding to the orbital angular momentum. So the letter 'S' corresponds to L=0, 'P' is L=1, 'D' is L=2, etc. So the initial state has S=0, L=0 (so orbital angular momentum is zero), and J is 0 (since J = L + S; 0 + 0 = 0).

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the two nucleons emit a particle X. Let's denote the emitted particle's state as lowercase letters, like p, s, etc. Wait, the options have the emitted particles as p, p, f, s. Wait, p is for orbital angular momentum l=1 (since p is the second letter, s is l=0, p l=1, d l=2, f l=3). So in the options, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter.

So, for example, option B is 3S1 + p. So the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is l=1.

But wait, the particle X is a boson or a fermion? Oh, wait, the problem says it's a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Parity is a quantum number, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into this. Also, Pauli statistics require that the total wavefunction (which is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts) is symmetric if the particles are bosons and antisymmetric if they are fermions. But since we're dealing with identical particles, the Pauli exclusion applies. Wait, but in this case, the emitted particle X is a new particle, not a nucleon. Wait, no, because the problem states it's a bound system of two nucleons emitting a particle X. So X is a third particle, perhaps a pion or something else. If X is a boson, its spin is integer, but if it's a fermion, spin is half-integer. But the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the parity is given (-1) which is more relevant.

Wait, but I think the main point is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

So the initial state is a two-nucleon system, and they emit a third particle. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. But wait, the initial state is the two-nucleon system with certain angular momentum, and after emission, the two-nucleon system plus the emitted particle must have the same total angular momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the NN system emits X. So the initial state is the two-nucleon system with some angular momentum, and the final state is the two-nucleon system (now in a different state) plus X. So, the total angular momentum before and after should be the same.

But the initial state is 1S0: J=0. So the total angular momentum before emission is J_initial = 0. After emission, the system is the NN state plus X. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final. But J_initial is 0, so J_final must also be 0.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the initial state is just the NN system, so total J_initial is 0. After emission, the NN system and the emitted particle X must have their combined angular momentum equal to J_initial = 0. So the combined angular momentum of the NN and X must be zero.

But the way the problem is phrased is that the final state is the NN in a certain state, and X in a certain state. So the initial state is the NN in 1S0 (J=0). The emitted X has some angular momentum, so to find the final state, we need to consider the angular momentum of the NN system plus X.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the emission, so the initial state is the NN with J=0, and the final state is NN with some J' plus X with some angular momentum. So the total J must be conserved. But I'm not sure exactly how to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition of the NN system from its initial state to a different state, and X carries away some angular momentum. So the total angular momentum before (just the NN system, J=0) equals the total after (NN in state with some J, plus X's angular momentum).

Wait, but the initial state is the NN system, so the initial J is J_initial = 0. The final state consists of the NN system plus X, so their combined J must be J_initial = 0.

But, wait, the problem is about the parity as well. The parity of the initial state is needed, and the parity of the final state must match, considering the parity of X.

Wait, the initial state parity: for a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, since for each nucleon, the parity is +1 (they are fermions, but their intrinsic parity is +1 each?), but the orbital part contributes (-1)^L. Wait, no, in nuclear physics, the parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Because each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, but when you combine two nucleons, their spin doesn't affect parity; it's the orbital angular momentum that determines it. So for the initial state, which is 1S0: L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1.

Now, conservation of parity says that the initial parity equals the final parity. The initial parity is +1. The final state is the NN system (after emission) plus X. The parity of the final state would be the product of the parities of the NN and X. Because when you combine two independent systems, their parities multiply.

Wait, no, that's not entirely accurate. The parity of a composite system is the product of the parities of the components. So the initial parity is +1 (from NN), and X has parity -1. So the final state's parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X). Wait, but the initial state is just the NN system, so the initial parity is +1. The final state has the NN system plus X. So the parity of the final state is (parity of NN after emission) * (parity of X). But the initial parity is +1, so final must be same: (parity_NN) * (-1) = +1. So parity_NN must be -1.

Wait, that's an important point. Let me write that down.

Initial parity: P_initial = +1.

Final parity: P_final = P_NN * P_X.

But P_initial = P_final → +1 = P_NN * (-1).

So P_NN must be -1 because (-1)*(-1)= +1. So the NN system after emission must have parity -1.

Now, the parity of the NN system is determined by (-1)^L, where L is their orbital angular momentum. So P_NN = (-1)^L.

So (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So L is an odd integer. So L could be 1, 3, 5, etc.

So, the final NN state must have L odd.

Now, looking at the options, each option gives the final state of the NN.

Options are:

A) 7D1 + p → the NN state is 7D1. So D is L=2 (since D is the third letter, S=0, P=1, D=2). So L=2 for the NN state. But wait, we just found that L must be odd, so 2 is even. That would make P_NN = (-1)^2 = +1, which would make P_final = (+1)*(-1) = -1, which doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So that's a problem. But wait, the initial parity is +1, and the final parity should be P_NN * P_X = (+1) * (-1) = -1, but that's not equal to the initial parity. So that can't be. Wait, no, wait: initial parity is +1, so final must be +1.

Wait, no: initial parity is +1. So P_final = P_NN * P_X = +1. P_X is given as -1. So P_NN must be -1, as I thought before.

So P_NN = (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So the final NN state's orbital angular momentum L must be odd: 1, 3, 5, etc.

Looking at the options:

A) 7D1 → D is L=2. Even → no good.

B) 3S1 → S is L=0. Even → no good.

C) 3D3 → D is L=2. Even → no good.

D) 3P0 → P is L=1. Odd → good.

So already, options A, B, and C have even L, so they would make P_NN = +1, leading to P_final = (-1), which isn't equal to initial +1. So these options lead to parity violation, so they're not allowed.

Wait, but wait: the only option with L odd is D) 3P0. So that's the only possible one? But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Because the question is about which partial wave is not allowed, but all options except D have L even, which would make P_NN = +1, leading to P_final = -1, which is wrong. So those options would be disallowed. But the question wants which is not permitted, so options A, B, C would be invalid, but the options are only four, and the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted".

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in considering the parity. Let me double-check.

The problem says the initial parity is +1, and the final parity must also be +1. The emitted particle X has parity -1.

So the parity of the final state is the product of the parities of the NN state and X. So P_final = P_NN * P_X.

We need P_final = P_initial = +1 → P_NN * (-1) = +1 → P_NN = -1.

So the NN state after emission must have P_NN = -1. As P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}, this implies L_NN must be odd. So L must be 1,3,5, etc.

So which options have L_NN as odd?

Looking at each option's NN state:

A) 7D1 → D → L=2 → even → no.

B) 3S1 → S → L=0 → even → no.

C) 3D3 → D → L=2 → even → no.

D) 3P0 → P → L=1 → odd → yes.

So options A, B, C have even L, making their P_NN +1, which when multiplied by X's parity (-1) gives -1, which doesn't match initial parity. So these options are invalid. Only D is valid.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not permitted, so the answer must be one of the options that is not allowed. So options A, B, C are not allowed, but the options only have one correct choice. Hmm, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", so perhaps I'm misunderstanding which part is being considered.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angular momentum in more detail. The initial state has J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum must still be J=0. So the final state's angular momentum must add up to zero.

The final state is the NN system plus the emitted X. So the NN system has some angular momentum J_NN, and X has some J_X. The sum of these must be zero. So J_NN + J_X = 0 → J_NN = - J_X.

But angular momentum is a vector, and their magnitudes must be the same. So |J_NN| = |J_X|.

Wait, but that's only possible if J_NN = J_X, but with opposite directions. But since angular momentum is quantized, the total must be zero. So the only way this can happen is if J_NN = J_X and their directions are opposite, but for integer values, that's not possible unless both are zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sum of two angular momenta must be zero. So the only way is if each is zero. Because if J_NN and J_X are non-zero, their sum can't be zero unless they're equal and opposite, but in quantum mechanics, the total J must be a vector sum, which is not necessarily just the magnitudes being equal.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of possible angular momenta.

But perhaps another approach: the initial state has J=0. After emission, the NN state and X must combine to J=0. So the total angular momentum is zero.

So the NN state has some angular momentum J_NN, and the X has J_X. So J_NN + J_X = 0 → J_X = - J_NN.

But since angular momentum is a vector, the sum must be zero. So the only way this can happen is if J_NN and J_X are zero. But X is a particle emitted, so perhaps it has some angular momentum. So maybe the initial and final angular momenta are both zero, but that would mean the emitted X must have J=0 as well. Which is possible, but perhaps other possibilities exist.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible J for the final NN state and the emitted X.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition of the NN system's angular momentum. Let's say the initial NN state has J_initial = 0. After emission, the NN state has J_final, and the emitted X has j. The conservation of angular momentum says that J_initial = J_final + j. So 0 = J_final + j → J_final = -j. But since angular momentum is quantized, the possible j could be such that J_final is the negative (vectorially) of j. But this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the selection rules for the decay process. The parity and angular momentum must be conserved, but perhaps certain transitions are forbidden based on these.

Wait, another approach: the process is emission of a particle. So the initial state is the NN system with certain quantum numbers, and the final state is the NN system plus X. The total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

So, initial state:

NN: J_initial = 0, parity P_initial = +1.

After emission:

NN: J_NN, parity P_NN.

X: j_X, parity P_X = -1.

Total angular momentum: J_initial = J_NN + j_X → 0 = J_NN + j_X.

Parity: P_initial = P_NN * P_X → +1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So, J_NN = - j_X. But since angular momentum is a vector, this implies that j_X = - J_NN. But in quantum mechanics, the magnitude |J_NN| must equal |j_X|, and their directions must be opposite. But this is tricky because in quantum numbers, you can't have negative values; the magnitude is always non-negative. So the only way this works is if J_NN and j_X have the same magnitude but opposite direction vectors. But this is only possible if both are zero, which isn't the case here because X is emitted and must have some angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of the possible j_X and J_NN values.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to proceed.

We know that:

1. P_NN = -1 → L must be odd.

2. The NN's spin and orbital angular momentum must satisfy the condition from Pauli's statistics: T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Since T=0, this gives S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So for the NN state in the final state, S is the spin quantum number and L is the orbital angular momentum.

We have to determine for each option whether:

a) The final NN state has L odd (from the parity condition).

b) The condition S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 holds.

c) The angular momentum conservation is satisfied.

Wait, the problem gives the final NN state in each option as, for example, 3S1. So 3S1 refers to the term symbol (2S+1) L J. So for 3S1, (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S (the letter here is S, which is L=0). So for 3S1, S=1, L=0, and J=1.

Wait, but wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 3S1: 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is the letter S → L=0. J is 1.

So for each option's NN state, we can determine S and L.

So let's go through each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p.

The NN state is 7D1. 7 is 2S+1, so 2S+1=7 → S=3. D is L=2. J=1.

So S=3, L=2.

Condition: S + L mod 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 → 5 mod 2 = 1. So S + L is 1 mod 2. So condition holds.

But L=2 is even, which would make P_NN = (-1)^2 = +1. But earlier we found that P_NN must be -1. So this option fails the parity condition.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

NN state: 3S1.

(2S+1)=3 → S=1. Letter S → L=0. J=1.

So S=1, L=0.

Condition: S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 → 1 mod 2 → condition holds.

But L=0 is even, so P_NN = (-1)^0 = +1. Doesn't meet the required parity of -1. So this is invalid.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

NN state: 3D3.

(2S+1) =3 → S=1. D is L=2. J=3.

So S=1, L=2.

Condition: 1 +2 =3 → 3 mod 2=1 → condition holds.

But L=2 is even → P_NN = +1. Not allowed. So this option is invalid.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

NN state: 3P0.

(2S+1)=3 → S=1. P is L=1. J=0.

So S=1, L=1.

Condition: 1 +1 =2 → 2 mod 2=0. So condition would not hold (needs to be 1 mod 2). Wait, wait. Wait, the condition is T= S + L +1 mod 2. And T=0.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

So S + L must be 1 mod 2.

In option D, S=1, L=1.

1 +1 =2 → mod 2 is 0. Which is not equal to 1. So condition is violated.

Wait, that's a problem. So in option D, the condition doesn't hold. But earlier, we had that parity condition holds because L=1 (odd) → P_NN = (-1)^1 = -1. So the parity condition is satisfied, but the Pauli condition is not.

Wait, that's a problem. So for option D:

Condition: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

S=1, L=1.

1 +1 +1 =3 → mod 2 is 1. So 0 =1 → no, condition not satisfied. So option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

But wait, the question says that Pauli statistics require that T = S + L +1 mod 2. And T is 0.

So 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L) ≡ 1 mod 2.

So for each option, (S + L) must be 1 mod 2.

Let me recheck each option.

Option A: S=3, L=2. 3+2=5 → mod 2=1 → condition holds.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1 → condition holds.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3 → mod 2=1 → condition holds.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →1+1=2 → mod 2=0 → condition not holds.

So option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

But earlier, the parity condition is only met by option D, because other options have even L, which make P_NN=+1, which doesn't satisfy the parity conservation.

So now, I'm confused. Because for the parity condition, only option D satisfies P_NN =-1.

But option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So, how can that be? It must mean that option D is not allowed, but that can't be because the parity condition requires it. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the angular momentum conservation more carefully.

Wait, the initial state has J_initial=0. After emission, the NN state has J_NN, and the emitted X has j_X. The total J_final must be J_NN + j_X = 0.

So J_NN = - j_X.

But since angular momentum is quantized, the only way this can happen is if J_NN = j_X, and their directions are opposite. But since J is a vector, the possible values are such that J_NN and j_X have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

But the problem is that for the total angular momentum to be zero, the individual angular momenta must form a closed triangle. So if J_NN and j_X are equal and opposite, their sum is zero. But their individual magnitudes must be such that |J_NN| = |j_X|, and their vector sum is zero.

But the problem is that the possible J values for the NN and X must satisfy this condition.

So for each option, I can compute J_NN, and then see if j_X can be such that J_NN + j_X =0.

But in the options, the emitted X's angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. So, for example, in option D, the emitted particle is 's', which is l=0 (s orbital). So j_X would be 0 because l=0, and spin is 0 for bosons? Or wait, X is a boson or fermion? Wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. But I'm not sure about its spin. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the spin doesn't matter, and we're only considering the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the term symbol is given, and the emitted particle's state is given as, say, 'p', which is l=1. So perhaps the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is l=1, and its total angular momentum is j_X = l + s, where s is its spin. But perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital part for the angular momentum conservation.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the problem might be considering that the emitted particle's total angular momentum is given by its orbital angular momentum. But that might not be accurate because spin also contributes. But perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the emitted particle's angular momentum is given by its orbital angular momentum (l) and that its spin is zero (so j_X = l). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the parity and the Pauli condition, and the angular momentum is a secondary consideration.

Wait, perhaps I should make a table for each option to summarize the findings.

Option | NN State | S | L | S+L | Parity NN | Pauli Condition (0 = S+L+1 mod2) | L is odd?
A | 7D1 |3 |2 |5 →1 | +1 → no | yes (S+L=5 mod2=1 → 0=1+1=2 mod2=0 → no) | L=2 even → no
B |3S1 |1 |0 |1 →1 | +1 → no | yes (1+0=1 →0=1+1=2 mod2=0 → no) | L=0 even → no
C |3D3 |1 |2 |3→1 | +1 → no | yes (1+2=3→1 →0=1+1=2 mod2=0 → no) | L=2 even → no
D |3P0 |1 |1 |2→0 | -1 → yes | 0 = (1+1)+1 mod2 → 3 mod2=1 → 0≠1 → no | L=1 odd → yes

Wait, no, for option D:

Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.

T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2.

S=1, L=1 → 1 +1 +1 =3 → mod2=1. So 0=1 → no, condition not satisfied.

So option D doesn't meet the Pauli condition, but meets parity condition. So it's invalid.

Hmm, but then none of the options meet both parity and Pauli conditions. That can't be right because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition. Let me go back.

The initial parity is +1. The final state's parity is P_NN * P_X = P_NN * (-1) = +1 → P_NN must be -1 → L must be odd.

So options must have L odd.

Only option D has L=1 (odd), so it's the only option that could satisfy parity. But it fails the Pauli condition.

So perhaps the issue is that for option D, the Pauli condition isn't met, making it impossible, even though parity is satisfied. So option D is not allowed.

But why? Because the Pauli condition is a requirement for the process.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me recheck.

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Given T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

So S + L must be 1, meaning their sum is odd.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even → doesn't satisfy.

So option D fails the Pauli condition.

So which options are invalid?

Option A: parity invalid → invalid.

Option B: parity invalid → invalid.

Option C: parity invalid → invalid.

Option D: parity valid, but Pauli condition invalid → invalid.

Wait, that can't be, because the question says one of them is not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition.

Wait, the problem states: Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2).

Wait, does this mean T = S + L +1 mod2, or T = (S + L +1) mod2?

Wait, T is the isospin. But the equation is written as T = S + L + 1 mod2.

So for T=0: 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

So S + L must be 1 mod2.

So, for each option, calculate S + L mod2.

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 mod2=1 → condition holds.

Parity: L=2 → P_NN=+1 → invalid.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1 → condition holds.

Parity: L=0 → P_NN=+1 → invalid.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3 mod2=1 → condition holds.

Parity: L=2 → P_NN=+1 → invalid.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →1+1=2 mod2=0 → condition doesn't hold.

Parity: L=1 → P_NN=-1 → valid.

So only option D has L odd (satisfies parity) but fails the Pauli condition.

Wait, but if the parity condition is satisfied, but Pauli condition is not, then the process is not allowed. So which option is invalid?

The question is which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave is the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum, I think. So the options list the emitted particle's orbital state as p, p, f, s, which correspond to l=1,1,3,0.

So the question is which of these transitions is not allowed because either parity or Pauli condition is not met.

But for the options with even L (A, B, C), parity condition isn't met. So those are invalid. Only D has L odd, but Pauli condition isn't met, making it invalid as well.

So none of the options are allowed, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the Pauli condition.

Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod2. So for the final NN state, T(NN) must equal S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, but is T a given? The problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So for each option, T=0.

So:

0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

So for option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → 0 mod2. So condition not met.

So the only option that meets the parity condition (L odd) is D, but it doesn't meet the Pauli condition.

So for the process to be allowed, both conditions must be met: parity and Pauli. So none of the options meet both conditions, which is impossible.

But the question expects one of the options to be invalid. So perhaps I made a mistake in the parity calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate the parity for each option.

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 → P_NN=+1 → P_final=+1 * (-1) = -1 → doesn't match initial parity +1 → invalid.

Option B:3S1 → L=0 → P_NN=+1 → P_final = (-1) → invalid.

Option C:3D3 → L=2 → P_NN=+1 → P_final=-1 → invalid.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 → P_NN=-1 → P_final= (-1)*(-1)=+1 → valid.

So only option D has correct parity. But its Pauli condition isn't met.

So this suggests that option D is the only possible candidate, but it fails the Pauli condition. So perhaps the process is not allowed because of the Pauli condition.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the partial wave is the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So if the process is not allowed for any reason, the option is invalid.

But in this case, option D is the only one with correct parity, but it fails the Pauli condition. So it's invalid. All others have incorrect parity and fail.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So all options except D have incorrect parity, but D has incorrect Pauli condition. So which one is invalid?

The question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer must be the option that doesn't satisfy either the parity or the Pauli condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of another angle. The emitted particle's orbital angular momentum must be such that the angular momentum is conserved.

The initial state has J=0. The emitted X has some angular momentum j_X. The final NN state has J_NN. So j_X = J_NN (since J_initial = 0 → J_NN + j_X =0 → j_X = - J_NN).

But since j_X must be a non-negative integer, the only way this works is if J_NN = j_X =0. Because j_X can't be negative. So the only possibility is J_NN = j_X =0.

So for the final NN state, J must be 0. So we can check which options have J=0 for the NN state.

Looking at each option's NN state:

Option A:7D1 → J=1 → not 0 → invalid.

Option B:3S1 → J=1 → invalid.

Option C:3D3 → J=3 → invalid.

Option D:3P0 → J=0 → valid.

So only option D has J=0 for the NN state, which would allow j_X=0. So the emitted X must have j_X=0. So the emitted X must have orbital angular momentum l=0 (s orbital), and spin 0 (since j_X = l + s → 0 =0 + s → s=0).

So the emitted particle's orbital state must be s (l=0). Looking back at the options:

Option D's emitted particle is 's' → which is l=0. So that's correct.

So angular momentum conservation holds only for option D. But earlier, it failed the Pauli condition.

Wait, but if the emitted X's angular momentum is zero, then the Pauli condition may not apply because the spin and isospin might not contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the Pauli condition is a separate consideration, regardless of the emitted particle's properties. So for the NN state, T=0, and S and L must satisfy S+L=1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0 mod2. So condition not met.

But for angular momentum conservation, only option D is possible. But it fails the Pauli condition.

This is getting really confusing. Perhaps the correct approach is to note that only option D meets the parity condition, but it fails the Pauli condition. Thus, the process is not allowed, making option D the invalid one. But looking at the options, the question is which partial wave is NOT permitted. So if option D is the only one that meets the parity condition but fails the Pauli condition, it would be the one that's not permitted.

Wait, but the other options don't meet the parity condition, so they are also invalid. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, B, or C because they don't meet the parity condition. But the question is to choose which is not permitted.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum must have a certain value for the process to conserve angular momentum. So the only option that allows J_NN=0 (so j_X=0) is option D, but it fails the Pauli condition, so it's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let's re-express the condition:

T = S + L +1 mod2.

T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

So for the NN state:

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod2 → condition not met.

So it's invalid.

But all other options have L even, so they don't meet parity. So they are invalid.

Thus, the only possible conclusion is that the correct answer is option A, B, or C because they don't meet parity condition. But the question is which is not permitted. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but the question is about the partial wave of the emitted particle. So the allowed partial waves are those where the process is permitted. The correct process must satisfy both parity and Pauli conditions, as well as angular momentum conservation.

But perhaps the correct approach is to eliminate the options based on the Pauli condition.

Wait, for each option, calculate S + L mod2.

If S + L ≡1 mod2 → Pauli condition is satisfied.

So options:

A: S=3, L=2 →3+2=5 → mod2=1 → condition holds.

B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1 → condition holds.

C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3 → mod2=1 → condition holds.

D: S=1, L=1 →2 → mod2=0 → condition not holds.

So options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition. Only option D doesn't.

But options A, B, C have L even → parity condition not holds. Only D has L odd, but fails Pauli.

So the only way for a process to be allowed is to meet both conditions.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which has L=0 (even) and S=1. So S+L=1 → condition holds. But parity condition not holds, so invalid.

Wait, but the question is which is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet either parity or Pauli conditions.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option D, because it's the only one that meets the parity condition but fails the Pauli condition, making it invalid. So the process isn't allowed because of the Pauli condition.

So based on that, the answer would be option D.

Wait, but the problem is that the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden partial wave is the one where either parity or Pauli condition isn't met.

So the possible forbidden options are A, B, C because they don't meet parity, and D because it doesn't meet Pauli.

But the question is about which is not permitted, so all except one are permitted. But this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the parity of the final state must be +1, which requires that the NN state has L odd. Only option D has L=1 (odd). But it fails the Pauli condition, so it's not allowed. Thus, the process is not permitted for option D because of the Pauli condition, making the partial wave 's' not allowed. Or perhaps the partial wave is 'p' in option A?

Wait, the emitted particle's partial wave is given by the lowercase letters. So in option D, the emitted particle is 's' (l=0).

But if angular momentum conservation requires j_X=0, then the emitted particle must have l=0, which is 's'. So option D is the only one where the emitted particle's orbital is 's' and the NN state has J=0.

But since Pauli condition isn't met, the process is forbidden.

Thus, the process in option D is forbidden because despite meeting the parity condition, it fails the Pauli condition.

So the answer is option D.

Wait, but the question is about the partial wave of the emitted particle. So the forbidden partial wave is 's' in option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's the only one that could meet the parity condition but fails Pauli, making it the forbidden option.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of parity and the Pauli condition for the final NN state. The initial state is a two-nucleon system in the 1S0 state, with total angular momentum \( J = 0 \) and parity \( P = +1 \). The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \). The Pauli condition requires that for the final NN state, \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), where \( T(NN) = 0 \). This implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Additionally, the parity of the final NN state must satisfy \( P(NN) = -1 \), which requires \( L(NN) \) to be odd.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
   - The final NN state is \( 7D1 \), where \( S(NN) = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)) and \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)).
   - **Parity Check**: \( P(NN) = (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \). This does not satisfy \( P(NN) = -1 \), so the parity condition fails.
   - **Pauli Condition**: \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). The Pauli condition is satisfied.
   - **Conclusion**: The parity condition is not met, so this option is invalid.

2. **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
   - The final NN state is \( 3S1 \), where \( S(NN) = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L(NN) = 0 \) (since \( S \) corresponds to \( L = 0 \)).
   - **Parity Check**: \( P(NN) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \). This does not satisfy \( P(NN) = -1 \), so the parity condition fails.
   - **Pauli Condition**: \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). The Pauli condition is satisfied.
   - **Conclusion**: The parity condition is not met, so this option is invalid.

3. **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
   - The final NN state is \( 3D3 \), where \( S(NN) = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)).
   - **Parity Check**: \( P(NN) = (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \). This does not satisfy \( P(NN) = -1 \), so the parity condition fails.
   - **Pauli Condition**: \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). The Pauli condition is satisfied.
   - **Conclusion**: The parity condition is not met, so this option is invalid.

4. **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
   - The final NN state is \( 3P0 \), where \( S(NN) = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L(NN) = 1 \) (since \( P \) corresponds to \( L = 1 \)).
   - **Parity Check**: \( P(NN) = (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1 \). This satisfies \( P(NN) = -1 \), so the parity condition is met.
   - **Pauli Condition**: \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This does not satisfy \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), so the Pauli condition fails.
   - **Conclusion**: The Pauli condition is not met, so this option is invalid.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies the parity condition is **D**, but it fails the Pauli condition. Therefore, the process is not permitted for option D due to the violation of the Pauli condition.

**Answer: D**
