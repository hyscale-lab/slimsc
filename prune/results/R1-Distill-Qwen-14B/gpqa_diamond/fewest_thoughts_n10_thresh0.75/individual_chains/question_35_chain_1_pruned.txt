Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Okay, so the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can often be represented as matrices, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors have specific physical meanings, like possible outcomes of measurements and the corresponding states.

The problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And the matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, let me write that out. 

So, S = [[0, -i],
         [i, 0]]

Then, Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix. So Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. 

Wait, wait, no. Matrix multiplication by a scalar is straightforward. So each element of S is multiplied by c. So the first element is 0 * c, which is 0. The (1,2) element is -i * c, so that's -(i h)/(4π). Similarly, the (2,1) element is i * c, which is (i h)/(4π). The (2,2) element is 0.

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix:
[ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

So, the matrix Ay - λ I would be:
[ [ -λ, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4π) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that determinant. The trace is (-λ) + (-λ) = -2λ. The determinant is (λ^2) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Wait, no, the determinant is ad - bc
