Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all some form of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I need to recall what these structures look like. Acetate esters have the structure OAc-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. The main difference between propenyl and butenyl is the number of carbons in the R group. Propenyl has three carbons (CH2-CH2-CH2?), wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So propenyl would be something like CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond, maybe CH2=CHCH2-OAc or similar.

Wait, no, the acetate ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but for propenyl, maybe it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the structures.

So, the options are either propenyl or butenyl acetate, and whether they're cis or trans. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify.

Wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but in an ester, it would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond. Oh wait, no. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester oxygen is connected to the propenyl group.

Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons. So butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or something else. Wait, but butenyl could be either 1- or 2-butenyl. Hmm, but the question specifies butenyl, so probably 2-butenyl.

Now, the NMR data is given as follows:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H,
