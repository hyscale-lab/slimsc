Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I'm thinking, this is a two-level system, probably spin-½ particles because there are two states, up and down.

First, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of some operator A. The matrix representation of A has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, that makes sense. Let me write out what this matrix looks like.

For a two-level system, the matrix would be 2x2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So A looks like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no. Wait, A_ij is zero when i equals j, and ħ/2 otherwise. So yeah, the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2, but maybe not exactly. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but the question is about finding the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the eigenstates of the operator. So the eigenstates of A will be the same as those of σ_x since A is a scalar multiple of it.

So σ_x has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/√2. Because σ_x is the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, so to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A (which are |+x> and |−x>), I need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But before that, I should probably normalize |alpha> because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), whose magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2) = 2.

The coefficient for |down> is (2−i), magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, okay. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of A.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me set |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Combine the terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ − c_-) / sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But we know that |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So equating coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( c_+ − c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (c_+ +
