Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in the lab. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Hmm. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the relativity of simultaneity and the speed limit at c. So maybe I should think about this in terms of the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through the glass. The speed of light in the glass (without considering motion) is c/n. Right, because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, v_light_medium = c/n.

But now, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light in the lab frame?

I think I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula here. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh right, that's when you're transforming from one frame to another moving at velocity v. So the medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light in the medium has velocity u = c/n in the medium's frame, but what matters is how it appears in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me clarify: the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the lab. So from the lab's point of view, any objects in the medium are moving at v. The light is moving through that medium, but the medium is itself moving.

So the light's velocity in the medium's frame is u_medium = c/n in the direction of the beam. But the medium itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, same direction as the beam.

So to get the lab frame's measurement of the light's velocity, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation for velocities. Because from the lab's perspective, the medium is moving,
