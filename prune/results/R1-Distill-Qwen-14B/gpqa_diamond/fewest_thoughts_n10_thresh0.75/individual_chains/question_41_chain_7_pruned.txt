Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. And we need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember from my classes that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed from outside isn't just simply the same as c/n. Because in a medium, light's speed is c/n, right? But when the medium is moving, I think we have to consider some sort of addition of velocities, like in special relativity. Or maybe it's just a classical approach? I'm a bit confused.

Let me think. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v, so how does that affect the observed speed? If the glass is moving towards the observer, then the light's speed relative to the lab might be different.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula applies. Oh, right! The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²) when moving from one frame to another. But wait, here the medium (glass) is moving. Does that change things?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how do we calculate it?
