Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let's think through this.

First, let me read the problem again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here. So the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. That's probably a common mistake, but I think relativity does something different.

So the first part is about the relative speed. Let me jot down the formula for relativistic velocity addition. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects from the rest frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no—actually, the formula for the relative velocity when you have two objects moving at u and v from the lab frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, say, one at u and the other at v (with u > v), then the relative speed of the first from the second's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). 

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should define their velocities. Let's say astronaut 1 has mass 2m and velocity u = 0.6c. Astronaut 2 has mass 3m and velocity v = 0.5c.

We need to find the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1. So in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at what speed? Using the velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)), but wait, no, wait. Let me get this
