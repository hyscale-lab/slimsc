Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The problem says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to determine which of the given options could be the structures of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, specifically following Markovnikov's rule. But wait, the compound here is an ether, right? The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the benzene ring is connected via an ether linkage (O) to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-enyl group.

Wait, the structure of the alkyl chain attached to the oxygen: but-3-en-1-yl. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I number from the oxygen, which is connected to the benzene). So, the oxygen is on carbon 1, then a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out:

The structure is: O-benzene connected to CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4? No, because but-3-enyl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the enyl group is four carbons long. The double bond starts at position 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the butenyl group is four carbons. So, the structure should be: (CH2)2-C(CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents.

Wait, the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group has four carbons. The substituents are on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the group would be: O-benzene connected to CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double
