Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options for the chemical formula are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So, four possible formulas, and I need to pick the right one based on the given data.

First, let's break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The data says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Esters and alcohols both have O-H, but esters typically don't have a broad peak because the O-H is not as acidic. Wait, no, wait. Esters usually don't have an O-H group. Wait, wait, hold on. Let me think. Esters have a carbonyl group but no O-H. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, if the peak is very broad, that's more typical of a carboxylic acid or possibly an alcohol, but the broadness can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH from something else like a phenol? But phenol's O-H is usually a bit broader and around 3200-3600, maybe. Wait, but the peak here is at 3000 though, which is a bit lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol with hydrogen bonding. But I'm not sure yet. Let me look at the other FTIR peaks.

There are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a classic carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated or an aromatic ring with some sort of group. For example, conjugated carbonyls like in an ester or a ketone, or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide or another type of carbonyl, but there's no mention of amide signals elsewhere. Let's think about possible structures.

So, FTIR suggests the presence of O-H (from the 3000 peak) and two carbonyl groups. Wait, or maybe one carbonyl and another group. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic C=C stretching, but that's usually around 1600. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone in conjugation with something else. Or perhaps a carbonyl from an acid, but I'm not certain yet.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. The data says there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. That suggests the presence of a double bond, perhaps an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, which would account for the vinyl H's in the NMR.

Now, the mass spectrometry. The fragment peak is at m/z =45. 45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to (CH3)2COH, which is the ion for pentanol or something similar. Wait, no, what's 45? Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, 58?), no. Wait, the molecular ion for CH3CH2OH (ethanol) is 46, but the fragment m/z 45 might be CH3CH
