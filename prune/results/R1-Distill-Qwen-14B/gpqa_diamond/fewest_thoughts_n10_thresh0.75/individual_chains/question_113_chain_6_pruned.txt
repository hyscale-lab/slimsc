Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Let's see what information I have.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, let's break down each piece of data given.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from something like an aromatic -OH, but that's less common, right? Or maybe an alcohol. 

It also shows strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, or maybe an amide. But since the options don't include nitrogen, probably not an amide. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. Could that be from another carbonyl group, maybe an adjacent conjugated group? Or perhaps it's a double bond or aromatic ring. Wait, wait. Wait, 1650 is around where conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents might absorb. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a strong peak, maybe a carbonyl. But then 1650 could be an aromatic ring, maybe a C=C stretch. Or perhaps an amide, but again, no N in the options. Alternatively, maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups? Like perhaps a ketone and an ester, or something else. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, right? So that
