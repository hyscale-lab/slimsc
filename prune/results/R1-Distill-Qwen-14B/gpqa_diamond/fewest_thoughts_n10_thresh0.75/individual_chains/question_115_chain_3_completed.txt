Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, let me read the question carefully. 

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate each other, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Right, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need the actual velocities now. Oh, but maybe I do when considering the energy and momentum.

Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta would be in opposite directions. But wait, the positron is a positive particle, so perhaps its momentum is in the opposite direction to the electron's. Let me think: the electron is moving left to right (from the left), so its momentum is along the positive x-axis. The positron is moving right to left, so its momentum is along the negative x-axis?

Wait no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So their initial momenta are opposite in direction. But wait, when they collide, their momenta would add. Wait, no, because the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite to the electron's. So their momenta are in opposite directions? Let me model this.

So, let's consider the electron moving along the positive x direction, the positron moving along the negative x direction. Since they annihilate, their total energy and momentum must be considered. Because in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum should be zero, right? Or wait, maybe not. Because when they annihilate, the system's energy and momentum must be considered.

Wait, the problem says that the two photons have the same energy and are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis. Since photons have momentum in the direction of their motion, and their energy is the same, their momenta must have the same magnitude but different directions.

Wait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy, which would imply their magnitudes of momentum are the same, since for photons, E = pc. So each photon has momentum p_photon = E/c. But since their directions are symmetric, their momenta vectors are symmetric around the x-axis.

So when the two photons are produced, their momenta add up to the same as the initial total momentum of the electron and positron.

Wait, but wait, the initial system's total energy and momentum are conserved. So perhaps the initial total momentum is the sum of the momenta of electron and positron, but in opposite directions. Let's think in terms of units. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and positron's as p_p. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is in the negative x direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) minus p_p (since it's in the opposite direction).

Alternatively, perhaps I should model their momenta as vectors. Let's take the direction to the right as positive. So the electron's momentum is +p_e, and the positron's is -p_p, because it's moving to the left.

Wait, wait. Positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron but positive charge. So when it's moving from the right along the horizontal axis, its velocity is towards the left, so its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum of the system is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) which would be p_e - p_p?

Wait, no. Wait, momentum is a vector. So if the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is in the negative x direction. So if the electron has momentum p_e in +x, the positron has momentum -p_p in +x (since it's moving to the left, which is -x direction). So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but the Lorentz factors are given as gamma_e = 4 for the electron, gamma_p = 2 for the positron. Because the electron is moving with gamma=4, which is a high speed, and the positron with gamma=2.

The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 0.511 MeV. So the total energy of each particle is gamma * m c². Let me compute their energies and momenta.

But perhaps I can compute their momenta in terms of their gamma and mass. For a relativistic particle, the momentum p is given by p = gamma m v. But another way to write it is p = gamma m v = (gamma m^2 c^2) (v/(c^2)) ) ?

Wait, wait, better to think in terms of relativistic momentum. The energy E is gamma m c², and the momentum p is gamma m v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma.

We know that for any particle, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's solve for v in terms of gamma. Let me square both sides: gamma² = 1/(1 - (v²/c²)) → 1 - (v²/c²) = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² → v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, for the electron: gamma_e =4 → v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4 ) ≈ c * 0.968.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p =2 → v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ c * 0.866.

So their velocities are in opposite directions. The electron's v is + (to the right), the positron's v is - (to the left).

Now, their momenta:

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4 ) ) = m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e * ( c * sqrt(3)/2 ) = m_e c sqrt(3).

But wait, the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction. So p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, wait, because p_e is positive, and p_p is negative. So p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - |p_p|.

Wait, no. Because p_p is negative, so p_initial = p_e + p_p = [m_e c sqrt(15)] + [ - m_e c sqrt(3) ] = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, that's the total initial momentum of the system.

Now, after the annihilation, two photons are produced. Let their momenta be vectors p1 and p2. Since they have the same energy, their magnitudes are same. So |p1| = |p2| = E_photon / c. Let's call this magnitude p. So p1 = p ( cosθ, sinθ ), and p2 = p ( cosφ, sinφ ), but wait, the problem says one photon is upper-right and another lower-right. So each photon's direction is in the upper or lower right quadrant. So for example, photon 1 has direction (x positive, y positive), and photon 2 has (x positive, y negative). So their angles from the x-axis are θ and -θ, perhaps. But not exactly, because the angles could be different. Wait, but the problem says their directions are symmetric, as one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but perhaps in opposite directions about the x-axis. But the question says their energies are the same, so their magnitudes are same, but the angles are symmetric concerning the x-axis.

Wait, but the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their angles with respect to the x-axis are θ and (360 - θ), but perhaps more likely, they're symmetric about the x-axis, so one is at angle θ above the x-axis, the other at angle θ below. But wait, their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right, so their y-components are in opposite directions. So perhaps their angles are θ and (180 - θ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the photons are moving in the upper right and lower right, which would mean their angles are both in the right half-plane, but one above the x-axis and the other below. So, for example, one photon at angle θ from the x-axis, and the other at angle -θ.

Wait, but in any case, the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum of the system (conservation of momentum).

So, let me model the photons' momenta as vectors. Let's denote photon 1 has momentum components (p_x, p_y), and photon 2 has (p_x', p_y'). But since their energies are same, |p1| = |p2| = p.

Moreover, photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so p_x and p_y are positive. Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so p_x' is positive, and p_y' is negative.

But wait, wait, lower-right would mean p_x' is positive, and p_y' is negative. So photon 2's momentum vector is (p_x', -p_y'), assuming it's symmetric.

Wait, but if the two photons have the same energy and their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, then their y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So, p1 has (p_x, p_y), and p2 has (p_x, -p_y). No, wait, that's not correct because if the photons are moving in the same x-direction, then their x-components would be same. But no, that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the two photons are symmetric in the sense that their angles are θ and (360 - θ), so their y-components are negatives. For example, photon 1 has (p cosθ, p sinθ), and photon 2 has (p cosθ, -p sinθ). That way, their y-components are opposite, and their x-components are same. But then their sum would be (2 p cosθ, 0), which would have to equal the initial momentum of the system. Hmm.

Wait, the initial momentum is along the x-axis, which is the case. So the total momentum of the photons must also be along the x-axis. So the sum of their y-components must be zero. That makes sense because the initial system had zero y-momentum (since both particles were moving along x). So the sum of p1_y and p2_y must be zero.

So, p1_y + p2_y = 0 → p sinθ + p sinφ = 0 → sinθ + sinφ = 0. So sinφ = -sinθ. That suggests that φ = -θ, or φ = 180 + θ, but considering the directions, the photons are in the upper-right and lower-right direction, so their angles are θ and -θ, respectively. So photon 1's angle is θ, and photon 2's is -θ.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So if photon 1 is at +θ from the x-axis, photon 2 would be at -θ.

In that case, their momentum vectors are:

p1 = p ( cosθ, sinθ )

p2 = p ( cos(-θ), sin(-θ) ) = p ( cosθ, -sinθ )

So when we add p1 and p2, the y-components cancel, which is good because initial momentum is all along x.

So the sum of p1 and p2 is (2 p cosθ, 0).

This sum must equal the initial total momentum, which we calculated earlier as p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait: the initial momentum was p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) → p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, earlier calculation: p_e = m_e c sqrt(15), p_p = m_e c sqrt(3). So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, the sum of the photons' momenta is 2 p cosθ in the x-direction. So 2 p cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But p is the magnitude of each photon's momentum, which is E_photon / c.

Wait, but the total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The energy of the electron is E_e = gamma_e m_e c² = 4 m_e c².

The energy of the positron is E_p = gamma_p m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

So total energy E_initial = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Since energy is conserved, the total energy of the photons must equal E_initial. Each photon has energy E_photon, so 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon = 3 m_e c².

So, since E_photon = p_photon c → p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c.

So p = 3 m_e c.

So, putting this into the earlier momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) * cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify: 2*3 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c: 6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cosθ = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Let me compute that value numerically to find theta.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cosθ ≈ 0.35682 → θ ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, let me compute arccos(0.35682).

Using a calculator. arccos(0.3568) is approx 69 degrees. Let me check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(69) is about 0.358, yes that's right.

So θ ≈ 69 degrees.

So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is the sum of their angles from the x-axis, which is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.

Wait wait, because one photon is at +69 degrees, the other at -69 degrees. The angle between them is measured from the upper photon to the lower photon, which would be 180 - (69 +69) = 42 degrees? Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait, the angle between the two photons would be the angle between their directions. So if one is at +69 and the other at -69, the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.

Yes, because each is 69 degrees from the x-axis, and on opposite sides. So the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, resulting in the production of two photons. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Momentum of the System**:  
   The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis but in opposite directions. Their momenta are:  
   - Electron: \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15} \) (positive x-direction).  
   - Positron: \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3} \) (negative x-direction).  

   The total initial momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
   \]

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
   \]  
   After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. Since the photons have the same energy:  
   \[
   2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2.
   \]  
   For photons, \( E = pc \), so the momentum of each photon is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c.
   \]

3. **Photon Momentum and Symmetry**:  
   The two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, symmetric about the x-axis. Their momentum vectors are:  
   \[
   \mathbf{p}_1 = p (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad \mathbf{p}_2 = p (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta),
   \]  
   where \( \theta \) is the angle of each photon with respect to the x-axis.

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum of the system. Adding the photon momenta:  
   \[
   \mathbf{p}_{\text{total}} = \mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 = (2p \cos\theta, 0).
   \]  
   Setting this equal to the initial momentum:  
   \[
   2p \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
   \]  
   Substituting \( p = 3 m_e c \):  
   \[
   2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
   \]  
   simplifying:  
   \[
   6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
   \]  
   Solving for \( \cos\theta \):  
   \[
   \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
   \]  
   Numerically:  
   \[
   \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \cos\theta \approx \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} \approx 0.3568.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
   \]

5. **Angle Between the Photons**:  
   Since one photon is at \( +\theta \) and the other at \( -\theta \), the angle between them is:  
   \[
   \text{Angle} = \theta + \theta = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
   \]

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
