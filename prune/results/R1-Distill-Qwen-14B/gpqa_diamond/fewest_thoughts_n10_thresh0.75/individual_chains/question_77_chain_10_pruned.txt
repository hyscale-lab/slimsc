Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Right, when they undergo this rearrangement, the positions of the double bonds change. The question gives two reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B from each.

First reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi followed by H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, a common initiator for various reactions. Since the starting material is a 1,5-diene, maybe it's undergoing a Cope rearrangement.

Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. Let me draw that. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a CH2-O- group attached to a butenyl chain. The butenyl is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH(C(CH2)2?) Wait, no, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)- something. Let me think: 1 is the starting point. So the substituent is on the benzene: CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me structure this correctly. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So:

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on the third carbon? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, so wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Or wait, numbering starts from the end where the
