Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, actually, I think it's a column vector with three elements: -1, 2, 1. So the state vector is Ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Do I need to normalize this first? Let me check: the normalization is the sum of squares of the absolute values of each component. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1 + 4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. But I might come back to that later.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. The operator P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
So P looks like:
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

And operator Q has:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1
So Q is diagonal, with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. The measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. So the question is, what's the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and when you measure Q immediately after, you get -1.

Hmm, but wait, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So first, when we measure P, we might get a certain eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. Then, measuring Q on that new state would give another eigenvalue.

So the process is:

1. Start with state Ψ.
2. Measure P, get outcome 0. So the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
3. Then, measure Q on this new state. What's the probability that Q is -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are independent, but I don't think so. The measurement of P affects the state, so the probability of Q's outcome depends on the new state after P's measurement.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Then, when we measure P and get 0, the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector
