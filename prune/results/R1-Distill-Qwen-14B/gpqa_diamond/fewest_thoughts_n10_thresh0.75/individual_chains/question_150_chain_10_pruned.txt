Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions. The options are four different aldehydes or similar structures, so I think the reactions might be leading to some kind of oxidation or elimination.

First, let's parse the given data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right because the degree of unsaturation has to be an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, O doesn't add into the formula as X, I think. Let me recalculate.

The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0 because it's not a halogen. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So, 5 degrees. Which could be a ring and some double bonds or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that’s a triplet, likely an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. So, there's an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. When coupled as a doublet, maybe two equivalent protons next to substituents.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, also doublet. Hmm, could this be an ortho coupling? Or maybe part of a different aromatic ring.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe some protons next to an electronegative group, like OH, but the integration is 2H. Wait, but broad singlet could be something like an enol proton or perhaps some adjacent to an OH group.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – a doublet, which could be next to a carbonyl or an oxygen. Maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring with substituents and an aldehyde group. Let me think about the structure.

The triplet at 9.72 is the aldehyde proton. So the structure likely has an aldehyde group. Then, the aromatic signals might indicate two substituents on the benzene rings, perhaps.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.
