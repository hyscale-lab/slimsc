Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each spin has two possible states, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them have the same energy, so I can group them.

Wait, let me think about each state. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). For each, I need to compute the value of E and then sum exp(-βE) over all states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state. Because the energy depends on that sum.

Let me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So, exp(-βE) = exp(β J H).

But wait, β is 1/(kT), so E = -J H, so βE = -J H β. So exp(βE) = exp(-β J H). Wait no, wait. Wait, no: E is -J H, so -β E = β J H. So exp(-β E) = exp(β J H).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J H.

So the partition function is sum_{all states} exp( -beta * E ) = sum exp( beta J H ).

But H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So each term in the sum is exp(β J H).

I need to find all possible H values and how many states have each H.

Let me list all possible states. Since each spin is ±1, there are 8 possible states.

Let me compute H for each state.

But that might take a while, but perhaps I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of H and the number of states that correspond to each H.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. H is the sum of three such terms.

So the maximum possible H is 3 (if all three terms are +1), minimum could be -3 (if all three are -1). But wait, wait: can that happen? Let me think.

Wait, let's take S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H=3.

Similarly, if all spins are -1, S1S2=1, same for others, so H=3 again.

Wait, did I just get H=3 in both cases where all are same? So when all spins are same, H is 3.

What about when two are same and one different? Let's say S1=S2=+1 and S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Similarly, another case where two are -1 and one +1. Let's say S1=S2=-1, S3=+1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

What about when all spins are different? Wait, with three spins, you can't have all three different because each can be +1 or -1. So the possibilities are having either all same, two same and one different, etc.
