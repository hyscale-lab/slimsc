Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light. This happens when there's a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Or wait, are there other possibilities? Oh right, some compounds can have other elements with chirality, like sulfur, but in these compounds, it's probably all about the carbon centers.

So I need to check each compound for any chiral centers. Let's go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Structure: The molecule is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3). Wait, no, wait. The formula is written as 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH). And C2 has a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, butene is four carbons. So perhaps it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond starts at C1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it:

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3.

But the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, chloro on C1, methyl on C2.

So structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no, but the structure is more like Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the next. So the structure is Cl–C(=CHCH2
