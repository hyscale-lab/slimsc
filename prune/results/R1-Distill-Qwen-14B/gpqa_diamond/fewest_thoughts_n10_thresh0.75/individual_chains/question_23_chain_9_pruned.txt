Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot had decreased, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the options A to D are the possible products.

Hmm, let's break this down. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better.

So, the main chain is butenyl, with substituents. The butenyl group is -O-benzene attached to the 1st position. Wait, no, the substituents are at the 2nd and 3rd positions. Wait, the formula is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me think: the butenyl group is four carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 3 (so between C3 and C4?), but wait, numbering starts from the end closest to the oxygen. So the structure is: the benzene has an oxygen attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me write it properly.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is: the substituent is at position 1 (the end closest to the oxygen). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Or maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Let me think again.

The butenyl group is four
