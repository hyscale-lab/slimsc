Alright, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum.

Wait, the dipole transition rules—what are they again? Oh right, for hydrogen, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum l changes by one unit. And the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It needs to go to n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the decay is via two dipole transitions, that means it must go through an intermediate state. Let me think about possible intermediate states.

First transition: from n=3, l=0. The next step should have l=1 because Δl=±1. So possible states are |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, the initial m is 0, so the first transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1. So m in the first state after transition can be 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so when it transitions to |2,1,m⟩, m can be 0, ±1. Then, from |2,1,m⟩, it transitions to |1,0,0⟩. Let's see the second transition's m changes. Starting from m in |2,1,m⟩, it has to go to m=0 in the next state. So Δm can be -1, 0, +1.

Let me take each possible intermediate state and see if the second transition is allowed.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first transition is m remains 0, which is allowed. Then from l=1 to l=0, which is Δl=-1, allowed. And m remains 0, which is allowed for the second transition. So this path is possible. The probability would be the product of the two transition probabilities. Hmm, but I don't know the exact probabilities here. The options give fractions, so maybe each transition has a certain probability, and the product gives the total.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first transition: m increases by +1. Then, from m=1, to m=0. Δm is -1, which is allowed. So both transitions are allowed. Same for option C: |2,1,-1⟩ as the intermediate. Then from m=-1 to m=0 is Δm=+1, which is allowed.

Wait, but which of these options are possible? I think any path where each step obeys the selection rules is allowed. So the question is, which of these options are correct in terms of the probability.

But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So perhaps each transition has a certain probability, and the total is the product.

Now, the probabilities might depend on the square of the matrix elements or the dipole transition matrix elements. But I'm not too familiar with the exact expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible transitions affects the probabilities.

Wait, for the first transition from n=3, l=0 (s orbital) to n=2, l=1 (p orbital). The possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So the initial state is m=0. So the possible transitions are to m= -1, 0, +1.

But the dipole transition matrix elements are proportional to <f| r |i>, where r is the position operator. For hydrogen, the
