Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let me think through the problem step by step.

The question says that the researcher introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then, they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After that, they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression, but couldn't overexpress the protein.

The provided DNA sequence is for the plus strand. I need to look for possible issues in the coding sequence that would prevent proper protein expression.

Let me first think about the possible reasons why the protein isn't overexpressing. The options given are A to D, so I'll go through each one.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm, if there's a mutation in the HA tag, that might affect purification but not necessarily prevent expression. Unless the mutation is in a critical region, but the main issue here is overexpression failure. So maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would mean a stop codon somewhere in the sequence. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. So I should check the DNA sequence for any such codons that might cause early termination.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence causing proteolysis. A linker between the HA tag and the protein might be needed to prevent the cell from recognizing it as a signal for degradation. Without a linker, maybe the protein is getting broken down. But wait, the problem is overexpression, so if the protein is not being made, maybe proteolysis isn't the issue. Unless the protein is made but quickly degraded, making it hard to detect. Hmm.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but the construct is in CHO cells, not mouse cells. CHO is a mammalian cell line, so their tRNA should have the same for UAA as mouse. Unless the construct is using a codon that's not present. Or wait, wait, another angle: if the construct has a stop codon, perhaps in the wrong place.

Now, looking at the DNA sequence. Let's find the start and see if there's an in-frame stop codon. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). So the reading frame is from there.

Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA sequence because these would code for stop codons. Remember DNA is read as 5' to 3', so the mRNA is complementary. So for example, a TGA in DNA would be CAT in mRNA, which would code for His. Wait no, wait: mRNA is complementary. So DNA sequence is plus strand, so mRNA is the same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So, looking for sequences that would code for stop codons.

Wait, let me see:

For a stop codon in mRNA, it's UAA, UAG, UGA. So in the DNA, the coding strand (which is the same as mRNA, except T for U) would have the sequence complementary to the stop codon. Let
