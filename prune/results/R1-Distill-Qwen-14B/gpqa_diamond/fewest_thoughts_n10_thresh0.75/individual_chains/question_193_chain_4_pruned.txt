Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, how does N depend on distance r?

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. Or wait, is it the other way around? No, wait, yes, plx is in arcseconds, and the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance r (in parsecs) would be 1 / plx.

So if I have N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let me calculate that: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. Wait, no, wait. Because 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, if N ∝ r^5, that means as r increases, N increases by the fifth power. But the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe it's the derivative, or the rate of change of N with r.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, perhaps it's asking for the rate of change, like dN/dr.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5r^4. So the rate of change would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The original relation is N = k * (1/plx)^5, but plx = 1/r, so N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But the question is about 'how does the number of stars change with distance per unit
