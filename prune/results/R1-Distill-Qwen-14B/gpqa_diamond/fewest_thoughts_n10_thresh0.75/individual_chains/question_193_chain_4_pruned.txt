Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each representing a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance d in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So if I have a distance d, the parallax is inversely proportional.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which can be rewritten in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. But wait, no, wait. Let's see. If N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/d, then 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think they mean the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr. Like, the differential number of stars with respect to distance. That would be dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be the derivative of d^5 with respect to d. So the derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because the number of stars per unit volume would depend on how volume scales with distance. Oh, wait, no—wait. The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps we're looking at the number density of stars as a function of distance.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of stars in a certain region (like a volume) as a function of distance. So when distance increases, how does the number scale?

But the question says "
