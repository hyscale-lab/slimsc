Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what an eigenvector is. An eigenvector of an operator is a non-zero vector that, when the operator is applied to it, doesn't change its direction, only its magnitude by a scalar factor, which is the eigenvalue.

The operator P is given as a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the total operator P would be the vector sum of these components in the direction n. Wait, no, actually, the operator P is given in terms of its components, but when it's along an arbitrary direction, I think the operator would be a combination of these components.

Wait, the operator in the direction n is P · n, right? Because any vector operator in direction n is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction cosines. So if n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because any direction in the x-z plane would have y-component zero. Oh wait, no. Wait. Actually, in spherical coordinates, any direction can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so cosφ is 1 and sinφ is 0. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n would be P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the operator P is given, and the components are matrices. So each component is an operator. So P_x is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, so each component (like P_x, P_y, P
