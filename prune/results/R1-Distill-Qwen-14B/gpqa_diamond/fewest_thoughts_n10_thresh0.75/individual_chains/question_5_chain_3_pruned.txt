Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, first, I need to understand the setup. The operator P is a vector operator, which means it has components in the x, y, and z directions. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, P is a vector operator, and I think the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n, where n is a direction in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So, the operator we're considering is the component of P in that direction. Oh, right, because the operator is P·n, which would involve all three components of P multiplied by the direction vector n and summed up. But n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n must be zero. So, n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), right? And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But wait, maybe I don't need to go into that. Let me think again. The eigenvector of P (or maybe P·n) with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm.

Wait, each component of P is given. So, the operator P is a vector operator, and in the direction n, the operator would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero.

So, the operator we're looking at is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

We need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but how do I proceed? I think I should construct the matrix for P·n and then find its eigenvectors.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. So,

Px = (ħ/2
