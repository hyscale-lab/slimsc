Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or cyclopropane. I think propene is more likely because C3H6 is the formula for alkenes and cyclopropane. Since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, which is a nonpolar solvent, I remember that alkenes undergo bromination via an addition reaction. So if A is propene, bromination would add a Br across the double bond. Propene has the structure CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, it's CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe 1-bromo-2-bromo... Wait, no, propene has three carbons: CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when bromine (Br2) adds, it forms 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction. Dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would have Br on adjacent carbons. So when eliminating, each Br would lose H, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product would be propene again, but wait, maybe it's more about where the double bond forms. If the structure is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcoholic) is used, two elimination steps might occur. Wait, but usually, elimination would remove adjacent H and Br. So perhaps each Br is on adjacent C, so removing H from each leads to forming a double bond between C1 and
