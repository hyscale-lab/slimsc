Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, stability constants are something to do with how stable a complex is, right? The higher the constant, the more stable the complex.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that.

The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are provided for complexes up to four SCN- ligands: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit odd because β4 is lower than β3. So maybe the complexes aren't getting more stable all the way up.

Stability constants are for each step of complex formation. Like, β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 is for Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on. So each β is the formation constant for adding another SCN^- ion.

To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (so the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex), I think I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in that form compared to all possible forms.

But wait, how do I approach this? I remember that when dealing with multiple complexes, we can model the distribution of metal species using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them up for the total. So, let's think about the possible forms of Co(II) in solution. The possible complexes are:

1. Co^2+ (free ion)
2. CoSCN^+ (monodentate, one SCN)
3. Co(SCN)_2^2+ (dithiocyanato, two SCNs)
4. Co(SCN)_3^3+ (tridentate, three SCNs)
5. Co(SCN)_4^4+ (tetradentate, four SCNs)

But since SCN^- is a ligand that can form multiple complexes, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the product of the β and the concentrations of the ligand raised to the number of ligands attached. But wait, each β is the formation constant for each step. So for the nth complex, the fraction is (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum of all such terms for each complex).

Wait, let me think again. The fraction for each complex can be calculated using the cumulative formation constant. So the formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. But wait, no, because β1 is the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+; β2 is the second step: CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^2+; and so on. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, actually, βn is the formation constant for the nth step. So the overall K for the nth complex would be K1*K2*...*Kn.

So for each complex, the fraction f_n is given by (K_total for that complex) * [SCN^-]^n / (sum of all K_total for each complex * [SCN^-]^m, where m is the number of ligands in that complex)

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the distribution of each species using the given stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN^-]^n / D

where D is the denominator, which is the sum over all possible n of (
