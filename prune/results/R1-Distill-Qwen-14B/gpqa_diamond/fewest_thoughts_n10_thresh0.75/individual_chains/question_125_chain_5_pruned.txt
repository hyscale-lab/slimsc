Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r². Oh right, that's Hooke's law for a force, which makes sense because a harmonic oscillator is involved.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let me think.

In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. Each energy level depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, for each direction (x, y, z), the energy is (n_x + ½) ħω for each, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, another way to think is that the levels are degenerate based on the total quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy would be (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no: the expression I remember is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, perhaps each direction contributes (n_i + ½)ħω, so summing them gives E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of each mode contributing (n_i + ½)ħω. So yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the ground state is when n=0, which gives E = 3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state would be n=1, giving E=5/2 ħω. Wait, no, wait: no, no, wait. Let me think again. Because n is the sum, the energy levels go up by each unit of n. So the ground state is n=0: E= (0 +3/2) ħω = (3
