Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to figure out possible structures. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a benzene ring (which has 3) plus two double bonds or rings, or maybe a ring and some double bonds. But considering the IR and NMR data, probably a benzene ring and an ester or amide group.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So the compound might have an amide group or an ester.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. Because in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet next to a CH2, which would be a quartet elsewhere. So maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: This could be an NH2 group, but wait the molecular formula has only one N. So maybe an NH group? Or perhaps an OCH2 group. Alternatively, if it's a singlet and broad, maybe an NH adjacent to something else. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula has only one N. So if it's an amide, the N would be in the amide group. Maybe it's an ethyl ester attached to a benzamide or something.

Another peak at 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: That's probably the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Because the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 is the adjacent CH2. So the ethyl group is split as triplet and quartet.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene. Each doublet has 2H, so probably two substituents on the benzene ring, each in para positions. Like OCH2CH3 and something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. For option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be benzoate (C7H5O2-) with ethyl ester (C2H5O), but then plus an NH2 group? Wait, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check:

Benzoate is C7H5O2; ethyl ester adds C2H5O, so total is C9H10O3? Wait no, wait. Wait, benzene ring (6 C) with COOEt, where Et is C2H5. So benzene (C6) + COOEt (C3H5O2). So total C9, H would be from the ester. Wait, wait, the ester is OCOOEt: O-CO-OCH2CH3.

Wait, when you have 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl adds C2H5, but with the NH2: wait, the structure would be O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2. So the formula would be C9 (6 from benzene, 3 from COOEt), H: let's think. Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2). COOEt is OEt, which is OCH2CH3. So the H count: NH2 (2 H), COO
