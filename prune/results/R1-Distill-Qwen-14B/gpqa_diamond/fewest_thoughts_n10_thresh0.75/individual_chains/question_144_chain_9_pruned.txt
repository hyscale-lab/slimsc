Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so I need to calculate that.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle can be related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the width. Oh right, because the width is related to the uncertainty in energy, which gives the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

But wait, how does that translate into the decay distance? Oh, right, once you have the lifetime, you multiply it by the particle's speed to get the mean decay length. So, decay distance L ≈ βγ c τ.

So I need to find the velocity β and the Lorentz factor γ for the meson X.

First, let's compute the energy and mass. The production energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy, but wait, E is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c².

So γ = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667. Hmm, wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., yeah.

Then, β is v/c. How to find that from gamma? I remember that γ = 1/√(1 - β²). So solving for β, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let me plug in γ=6.6667.

So 1/γ² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is about sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, so β≈0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Next, compute the lifetime τ. τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, units! ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me think.

I remember ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π), but when we use natural units, people often use ħ in GeV·s. So 6.58e-25 GeV·s.

But Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )
