Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. This particular problem is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, decay distance... I think that's related to how far the particle travels before decaying. But how do I calculate that? I remember something about the mean lifetime and relativistic effects. 

So, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The width Γ is the total decay rate, and the lifetime τ is the inverse of the decay rate. But wait, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle connects the width (which is the uncertainty in energy) to the lifetime (which is the uncertainty in time).

But wait, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So, I think I need to consider the particle's velocity when calculating the decay length. Oh right, the mean decay distance L is the product of the particle's velocity v and the mean lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, another thought. Since the particle has a high energy, we might need to use relativistic mechanics. So, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using the energy and mass, then find the lifetime, and then multiply the two to get the distance.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the total decay width Γ, which is given as 320 MeV. But wait, I think I might have to convert units here because the calculations probably require everything in compatible units, like seconds and meters.

Wait, no. No, wait. The decay width Γ is given in MeV, but when calculating τ, which is in seconds, I need to use Planck's constant. Let me think. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, but ħ is in J·s and Γ is in eV. So I'll need to convert Γ to Joules
