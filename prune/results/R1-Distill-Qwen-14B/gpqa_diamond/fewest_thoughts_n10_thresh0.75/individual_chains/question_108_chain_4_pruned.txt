Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question states that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line. Oh wait, that's the hydrogen emission spectrum, right?

First, I should probably recall what the paramagnetic coupling term is. Paramagnetic effects come from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and an external magnetic field. The term in the Hamiltonian is probably something like H_couple = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ for an orbital is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m / (some constants?), wait, more accurately, I think μ is proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number. So the expectation value ⟨H_couple⟩ would be proportional to m*B. That's the paramagnetic term.

But wait, actually, the Zeeman effect comes into play here. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ·B = - (g_e * μ_B * m) * B, where g_e is the electron's g-factor (~2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the expectation value ⟨H_Zeeman⟩ would be proportional to m*B.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. Since energy is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. Let me compute ΔE. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. So converting that to meters, it's 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = hc / λ. Let's plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s. So:

ΔE ≈ (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486
