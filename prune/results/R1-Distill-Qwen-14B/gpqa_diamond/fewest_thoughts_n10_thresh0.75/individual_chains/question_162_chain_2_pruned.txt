Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I think this is a two-dimensional metric, right? So we're dealing with a 2D surface, probably in some sort of spacetime because of the term "pseudosphere." Wait, pseudosphere is a term from hyperbolic geometry, right? Like, it's a surface of constant negative curvature.

The question is about finding the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, radius in the context of a pseudosphere—what does that mean exactly? I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the radius of a circle relates to the curvature. Oh right, the radius r is related to the curvature κ as r = 1/κ, but with a negative curvature here because it's a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the metric given might not be in the standard form. Let me think: the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates or something else. The usual metric for hyperbolic plane is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(1 - x² - y²) or sometimes (dx² + dy²)/( (1 + z²)^2 ) in other coordinate systems. But here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which makes me think of a different scaling.

Let me see: if I factor
