Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts because of the spherical symmetry.

Wait, the question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Oh right, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, I think the energy can also be written in terms of the principal quantum number n, but wait, in 3D it's more about the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, let me get this right. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Since the potential is isotropic, the energy depends only on the sum of these quantum numbers. The sum is often denoted by n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, the third excited state—what does that mean? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0), so E = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, the second n=2, the third n=3.

Wait, no. Wait, the ground state is n=0, so the first excited state is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state is n=3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That part seems straightforward.

Now, how about the number of eigenfunctions for that energy? That's the degeneracy. The degeneracy occurs because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same sum n. For n=3, how many ways can we write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers?

So, I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. This is a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (3 +2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 possible combinations. Each combination gives a distinct eigenstate, but they all share the same energy because the sum is the same.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches. Option C says 3, which can't be right because the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but another way: in three dimensions, the energy levels can also be thought of in terms of the quantum number n, which is n_x + n_y + n_z. For each n, the degeneracy is (n + 2 choose 2) + 1? No, wait, no, the degeneracy is (n +2 choose 2) when considering the number of states with the same n. So for n=3, (3 +2 choose 2) = 10, which is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which correspond to the vibrational states in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right),
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy depends only on the sum \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), so the energy can be rewritten as:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n + \frac{3}{2} \right).
\]

The "third excited state" refers to the state where \( n = 3 \) (since \( n = 0 \) is the ground state, \( n = 1 \) is the first excited state, \( n = 2 \) is the second excited state, and \( n = 3 \) is the third excited state). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula gives:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level corresponds to the number of distinct combinations of \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) that satisfy \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \) is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \).**
