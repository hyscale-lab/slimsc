Hmm, okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and start breaking it down.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were then passed through several tubes without cooling first. The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (number 1), then Ca(OH)2 solution (number 2), and finally red-hot copper (number 3). The results are that tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams, tube 3's by 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight didn't change. In the end, there were 2.24 liters of gas C left under standard temperature and pressure (STP).

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Alright, let's think about each part. First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The fact that only gases are formed suggests that the salts might contain some volatile components. Also, the setup involves passing these gases through different chemical traps.

Let's analyze each tube:

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It absorbs water (moisture). The fact that its weight increased by 3.60 g suggests that water was present in the gases. So, the initial gases must have included water vapor. Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so it would react with water to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, thus gaining mass.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If any acidic gases like CO2 were present, they would react with Ca(OH)2. But the problem states that the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So no reaction, implying no acidic gases (like CO2) were present in the gases. Alternatively, maybe the gas that passed through was neutral, like NH3 or something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. Actually, NH3 is a base. If there were NH3, it would react with Ca(OH)2, but Ca(OH)2 is a strong base. But if the solution is already saturated, maybe it couldn't absorb more, or perhaps the gas didn't react because it's not acidic. Hmm, need to think carefully.

But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So any acidic gas would have reacted, but it didn't. So perhaps the gas that reacted with Mg(ClO4)2 was water, and the other gases went through without reacting with Ca(OH)2. Maybe the other gases were like NH3 or others.

Moving on to tube 3: It's filled with red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So, the gas that passed through here must have contained something that would oxidize copper. Common gases that can cause such a reaction are hydrogen (H2) or carbon monoxide (CO). When these are passed over hot copper, they react to form water or CO2, and copper is oxidized to CuO.

Wait, but if it's H2, when it reacts with CuO (if any is present), it would reduce CuO to Cu and form water. Or if the copper is in a different state. Wait, the setup: the tube is red-hot copper. So perhaps the gas is something that reacts with hot copper.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the gases.
