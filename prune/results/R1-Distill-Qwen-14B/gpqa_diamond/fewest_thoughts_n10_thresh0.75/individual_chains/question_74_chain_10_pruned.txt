Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about the decay of a single atom. They say that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. But in this case, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So each atom has a certain probability of decaying in a given time interval, regardless of its age. Oh right, that's the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.

So the initial information is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. Let me think about how that relates to the decay constant or the half-life.

Wait, the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). So for t = 100 minutes, that probability is 0.32.

So 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. Therefore, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides gives -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but I think the exact value isn't necessary because we can work with the ratio.

Now, the question is, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. What's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes doesn't depend on the past 50. The chance is calculated from the current moment, not from when it started.

So the time we're considering is 150 minutes. The probability of decaying in this time is again 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

But wait, I can express λ in terms of the known value. From the 100-minute case:

λ = ln(1/(0.68)) / 100. Because e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = [ - ln(0.68) ] / 100.

Alternatively, λ can also be written as λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.

But maybe a better
