Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? Because the Sun is about 150 million kilometers away, and light takes that time. So if the pp-III reactions stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the effect on the neutrinos would be felt here now because neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light.

So, neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and their flux reaching Earth depends on the production rates. The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, the pp-III reactions must be part of the proton-proton chain, right? The proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I and pp-II are lower energy reactions, and pp-III is higher energy. Oh wait, maybe I should get that right. The pp chain's main branches: the initial steps are pp-I, then if conditions are right, they can go into pp-II and pp-III, which involve higher energies. So the pp-III branch probably produces higher-energy neutrinos.

In the Sun, the dominant source of neutrinos is the pp- I branch, I think. But the pp-II and pp-III are also part of the same chain but at higher temperatures or densities. If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos from that branch would cease.

So, neutrinos from the pp-III branch would have higher energies. If that branch stops, the flux of those higher-energy neutrinos would drop. But what about the lower-energy ones?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of two bands. Let's think about the energy distribution of the neutrinos. In the Sun, the neutrinos are produced in the core, and their energies depend on the reactions. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I and pp-II.

If pp-III stops, the number of high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-90
