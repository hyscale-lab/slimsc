Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Wait, the question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Oh right, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So the spin state vector χ is [3i, 4], right? Or maybe it's a column vector with those components. That makes sense.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh wait, S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. I think the Pauli matrices are involved here. Right, the Pauli matrix σ_y is given, and S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So, σ_y is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]] as per the note.

So, first, I need to write down the spin state as a column vector. The state is (3i, 4), so χ = [3i; 4].

Now, the expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Let me compute S_y first. S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S_y matrix is [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value would involve multiplying the vectors and the matrix. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the expression is:

⟨S_y⟩ = χ† S_y χ.

Where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ. So χ is [3i; 4], so χ† is [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait: χ is a column vector [3i; 4]. So χ† would be a row vector [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is a complex number, its conjugate is -3i. Wait, no, wait: 3i is 3*i, so its complex conjugate is 3*(-i) because i becomes -i. So 3i* is -3i? No, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of a + ib is a - ib. So 3i is
