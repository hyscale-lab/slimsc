Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, okay, the question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh right, it's probably L = -λ f ψ_f† (ῡ + X) ψ_f. That makes more sense. So this is a Yukawa coupling term between the fermion ψ_f and the boson X, along with the usual Yukawa term for the Higgs (ῡ and X look like fields, but I thinkῡ is the Higgs field and X is another scalar).

The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

In particle physics, a boson can decay into fermions if the energy (mass of the boson) is at least twice the mass of the fermion, right? Because each fermion and antifermion must have enough energy to be created. So for each possible fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

What's the mass of the boson X? 6 GeV. So 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait—what about the fermions available? Let me list the known fermion masses. Let me think about the quarks and leptons.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses: up and down are light, maybe around a few MeV each. Strange is ~100 MeV, charm ~1.5 GeV, bottom ~4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, about 173 GeV. Leptons: electrons, muons, taus. Electrons are ~0.5 MeV, muons ~105 MeV, taus ~1.78 GeV.

Wait, so let's calculate 2m_f for each:

Electron: 2*0.5 = 1 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than that—so X can decay into e+ e-.

Same for mu
