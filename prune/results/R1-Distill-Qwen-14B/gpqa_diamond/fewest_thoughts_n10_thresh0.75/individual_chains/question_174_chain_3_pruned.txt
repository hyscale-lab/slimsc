Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about nuclear fission. An atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. So the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but wait. Since the problem mentions that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, that's interesting. So the initial rest mass is M, and after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. That means that some mass has been converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, the rest mass can decrease as energy is released.

The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So M cÂ² = 300 GeV. But after fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so their combined rest energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the total energy released (the binding energy, perhaps) is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. But wait, actually, in fission, the released energy is the difference between the initial rest mass and the sum of the rest masses of the products. So that's 3 GeV in this case.

Now, this energy should go into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. But wait, because when the nucleus splits, the rest mass decreases, so the kinetic energy comes from that mass difference. So the total kinetic energy should be (300 GeV - 297 GeV) = 3 GeV. But that's probably the total
