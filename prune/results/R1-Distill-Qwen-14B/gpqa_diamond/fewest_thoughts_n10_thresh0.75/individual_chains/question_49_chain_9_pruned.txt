Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pericyclic reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question involves three different reactions, all sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond in a pericyclic reaction. So the general form is something like [n]s-cis or [n]s-trans, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

The first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form compound A. Hmm. Let me think about the structures here. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So its structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or maybe (CH3O)2CH2-NH2? Wait, no, wait, the amine is on carbon 1, so it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Alternatively, maybe it's (NH2)C(OCH3)2CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3O)2CH-CH2NH2? No, because ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So if it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the structure is like that.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH2-OH? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2. Wait, no, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think again. Butene is C4H8, but the position of the double bond and the hydroxyl group.

But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond from C3 to C4? But that's not possible because for butane, the positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, but that
