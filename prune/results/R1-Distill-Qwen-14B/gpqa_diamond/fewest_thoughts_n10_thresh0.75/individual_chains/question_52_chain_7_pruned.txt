Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the surface isn't covered, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They say that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to use the concept of the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The equation is something like:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors),
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the respective levels,
- k is the Boltzmann constant,
- T is the temperature.

The problem gives me a transition wavelength of about 1448 Å. I remember that the energy difference between the levels is related to the photon's wavelength via E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait—since the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength, that sets the energy difference. So, maybe I can calculate the ratio of the two ratios (n1/n2 with and without spots) based on the change in temperature.

Let me think: when the star has spots, it's cooler (5500 K) than when it's spotless (6000 K). The spots cause a decrease in the overall photospheric temperature. Since the ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on temperature, a lower temperature would make the exponent larger in magnitude (since E is positive), leading to a lower ratio. Wait, actually, the exponent is negative when E2 > E1, so higher E would mean n2/n1 decreases with lower T.

Wait, let's get back. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so the temperature is lower than 6000 K. Since the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, the ratio when there are spots (T=5500 K) would be:

r_spots = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

And without spots, it's:

r_no_spots = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

But wait, the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level
