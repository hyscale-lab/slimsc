Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about planets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? And the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, which probably doesn't matter much for the transit probability because the mass doesn't directly affect the size of the planet. Wait, but wait, the question mentions they've been detected via the RV method, so that gives us their minimum masses. But for transit probability, it's more about the size of the planet relative to the star, not the mass. Oh, but they don't give planet radii, so maybe we don't need to worry about that.

So the main factors for transit probability are the orbital period (which affects the orbital size) and the size of the star. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more edge-on, but if the orbit is more face-on, we won't see any transit. The probability also depends on the star's size because a larger star makes it less likely to block it.

The formula I remember for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the (1 / (a_planet / R_star * sqrt(1 - eÂ²))), but wait, the planets have circular orbits so e is zero. So the formula simplifies. But wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_*/ a)^2, but wait, actually, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbital plane that's aligned to cause a transit. So it's roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability for a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), which combines the orbital distance and the sizes. Hmm, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), so that would be (R_p^2 * R
