Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the complexity of the diagram and the order of the process. Each loop typically adds factors to the amplitude, which affects the calculation of things like integrals in the diagram.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to relate this to the loop count.

I think I should start by recalling how loop factors appear in Feynman diagrams. Each loop contributes a certain factor, like a loop integral, which often involves integrating over loop momentum. These integrals bring in factors of the coupling constants and possibly some numerical coefficients from the integrand.

Wait, the number of loops in a diagram is tied to the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence formula is D = 4L - 2I + V, where L is the number of loops, I the number of internal lines, and V the number of vertices. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here since I don't have V and I counts.

Alternatively, I remember that the number of loops is also related to the order in perturbation theory. For example, a tree-level diagram has zero loops, one loop for the first order in loop expansion, etc.

Looking at the expression, the factors are: alpha^3 (which is the fine-structure constant cubed), g^2 (another coupling squared), sqrt(2), 8, 1/(4pi)^6, and (Q/M)^2.

I remember that in loop integrals, each loop typically introduces a 4pi factor from the integration over angular variables, and possibly factors from the metric (like 2pi)^n. Hmm, but wait, in dimensional regularization, 4pi factors come from the loop integrals after Wick rotation, but here it's 4pi in the denominator.

Looking at the denominator: 1/(4pi)^6. So (4pi)^6 is in the denominator. If each loop contributes a 4pi term, then maybe the exponent 6 tells us something about the number of loops. Let me think: for each loop, you get a factor of 1/(4pi)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime
