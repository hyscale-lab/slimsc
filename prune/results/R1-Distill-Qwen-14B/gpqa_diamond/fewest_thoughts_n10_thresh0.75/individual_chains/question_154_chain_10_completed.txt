Okay, so I need to figure out what this unknown white solid is using the spectral data provided. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest mass, so that's the molecular weight. The other peak is at m/z 158, which is two mass units higher. That might suggest a fragment that's lost something, or maybe it's an isotope peak. Wait, but chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope at m/z = 35Cl and 37Cl, but wait, 158 is 156 + 2. Oh, wait, maybe the molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 is M+2, which would be due to chlorine isotopes. So the molecule probably contains a chlorine atom.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually indicates an -OH group, but it's broad so maybe it's an acid or a phenol. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is a typical range for a carbonyl group in an ester, acid, or maybe a ketone. If it's an acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but 1720 could also be an ester or maybe a chloroformate. Wait, chloroformate has a higher carbonyl stretch? Not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Now the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which is a strong singlet. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, an aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, phenolic OH protons are usually around 5 ppm, but if it's an acid, the -COOH proton is broad around 10-12 ppm. Oh wait, but in the NMR they mentioned it's a singlet at 11.0. That's a strong peak, maybe a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, the integration is 1H, so perhaps it's a single proton, like in a benzoic acid. Also, the broadness might be due to exchange with water, but in the NMR it's a singlet. Hmm, but in the data, it's 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). So maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but then it's usually a broad peak, not a singlet. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a different environment.

Wait, let me think again. The 11.0 ppm is a singlet, which suggests no neighboring protons. So if it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's a deprotonated form? Or maybe it's an aldehyde, but then why is it so upfield? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in an ortho or para position, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like in para-substituted benzene derivatives. The downfield shifts are indicative of electron-withdrawing groups. Because the protons are at 8.02 and 7.72, which are higher than the typical 7.2-7.5 range for benzene. So the substituents are probably electron-withdrawing groups, like Cl or a carbonyl group.

So if the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, perhaps one is a Cl and the other is a carbonyl group. Wait, but wait: in the NMR, the protons are split into two doublets. So perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons, but that's not possible for a para substitution. Wait, no, wait: in a para-substituted benzene, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. So the protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Alternatively, if it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para), then the protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4, but wait, that's actually para. Wait, no, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. Wait, but a benzene ring is symmetric, so substituents at 1 and 4 would lead to two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene, making the protons in two sets of doublets. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think about this. For a para-substituted benzene, if there are two substituents in the para positions, like positions 1 and 3? No, that's meta. Wait, no. If substituents are at positions 1 and 2, it's ortho. Positions 1 and 3 are meta. Positions 1 and 4 are para. Wait, but in that case, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So the ring would have four equivalent protons, but that's not the case here. Oh wait, no. If substituents are at 1 and 3 (meta), the ring's protons would split into two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. Alternatively, if substituents are at 1 and 4, that's para. Let me think about the NMR. The peaks are at 8.02 and 7.72, each as doublets. So the substituents must be in positions that split the ring protons into two doublets.

Another possibility is that the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), so the ring would have two doublets each with 2H. Wait, no, actually, if substituents are in adjacent positions (ortho), the ring protons would be split into more complex patterns. Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be benzaldehyde with OH at position 2 and Cl at position 3. So substituents are at 2,3 positions. The aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, but that would probably lead to more complex splitting. Let me imagine the structure:

Positions 1 (Cl?), no wait, the numbering. Let's number the benzene ring. Position 1 is where the aldehyde is attached. Wait, no. Benzaldehyde has the aldehyde group at position 1. So for 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the substituents would be at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring would have substituents in positions 1, 2, 3? No, that's more than two substituents. Wait, but the NMR only shows four protons, two doublets each integrating to two H. So maybe the molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring, making four H.

So looking again, the NMR has four aromatic protons. So the molecule must have two substituents on the benzene ring. So, perhaps options like benzoic acid or chlorobenzoic acid.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the substituents are Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. Wait, no, benzoic acid has COOH at position 1, and Cl at position 4. So substituents at 1 and 4. The ring would have substituents para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but then each pair would be equivalent. So the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be one set, and 3 and 5 another. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring positions 2,6 are adjacent to COOH, and 3,5 are adjacent to Cl. But how would that affect the NMR?

Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the two substituents are opposite each other. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Wait, but that's actually the same as substituents at positions 1 and 3, which is meta. No, wait, no. If the COOH is at position 1, then the Cl is at position 4 (para). So the substituents are across from each other.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The two protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded more than the others. Similarly, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded. But the substituents are para, so the coupling between protons would lead to each pair (2 and 6, 3 and 5) as doublets. Each pair would have two protons, so in the NMR, we'd see two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So in this case, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. The chemical shifts would be determined by the substituents. The COOH is electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent protons would be more downfield. The Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent protons would also be downfield. But how would their shifts compare?

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons next to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (downfield) than those next to Cl (positions 3 and 5). So their shifts would be higher. So in the NMR, the higher ppm would correspond to the protons next to COOH, and the lower ppm to those next to Cl.

Looking at the given NMR data: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So one set is higher, the other lower. So maybe the higher shift (8.02) corresponds to the protons next to COOH, and the lower (7.72) those next to Cl.

Additionally, the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. Wait, but in the NMR, that's a singlet. However, carboxylic acid protons are typically broad singlets because of hydrogen bonding. But in the data, it's a singlet, which could make sense. Also, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which fits a carbonyl group from a carboxylic acid (around 1700 cm^-1), but the shift being higher might suggest it's an ester or maybe an acid with some hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl from an acid chloride, but that would have a higher shift. But in this case, the IR suggests a strong carbonyl, which fits the carboxylic acid.

So putting it together: the molecular formula, the NMR, and IR suggest a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me check the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, let's calculate the molecular weight. C is 12, H is 1, Cl is 35.5, O is 16. So 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So molecular weight is approximately 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, but wait, wait, the molecular ion is at 156, but the formula would be 156.5. So that's close, perhaps rounded. The M+2 peak at 158 would be due to the Cl isotope (35Cl and 37Cl). So 37Cl would add 2 mass units, making M+2 at 158, which is 32% abundance, which is about the natural abundance of Cl (about 3% for 37Cl, but perhaps the abundance is higher because M+ and M+2 include both Cl isotopes). Hmm, wait, the molecular ion is M, and M+2 would be 37Cl. So the molecular ion is at 156 (from 35Cl), and M+2 is 158 (from 37Cl). The abundance would be about 3% of the 37Cl isotope, but wait, the M+2 is 32% of the M peak. That suggests that the molecular ion has Cl, because the M+2 would be due to Cl's isotopes. So the molecular formula must contain Cl. So the m/z 156 is for 35Cl, and 158 is 37Cl, which is about 3% of the Cl isotopes, but in reality, the M+2 peak would be about 3% of the M peak, but here it's 32%. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the molecular formula.

Wait, let me re-calculate the molecular weight of option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding a Cl (35.5) gives C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (7×12)=84, (5×1)=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total: 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So molecular weight is 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would be the M peak (from 35Cl), and M+2 at 158 (37Cl) should be about 3% of the M peak. But in the data, it's 32% which is higher. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe option B is not correct, because the M+2 peak is too large.

Let me check another option. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight same as option B, 156.5. So M is 156, M+2 is 158 at 3%. But the data shows M+2 at 32%, which is way higher. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCO-O-Ph. Molecular formula would be C6H4ClO3. Molecular weight: C=72, H=4, Cl=35.5, O=48. Total: 72+4=76+35.5=111.5+48=159.5. So molecular ion at 159.5, but the given data is 156. So that doesn't match.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7×12=84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32 (O) = 156.5. So M would be at 156, M+2 at 158 (37Cl), which again would be about 3% of M. But the data shows M+2 at 32%, which is 10 times higher than expected. So this might suggest that the molecule has more than one Cl? But all the options have only one Cl.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the NMR analysis. The singlet at 11 ppm. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the -COOH proton would be a broad singlet. Also, in the IR, the strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl. So that fits benzoic acid. So perhaps the M+2 peak is not due to Cl but some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is not in the molecule. Maybe the M+2 is due to something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the molecule has two Cl atoms. Let me check the options. Option A has a Cl and an OH. Option B has one Cl. Option C: phenyl chloroformate has one Cl. Option D has one Cl. So all options have one Cl. So the M+2 peak should be 3% of the M peak, but the data shows 32%, which is an order of magnitude higher. That's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the molecular ion is not the M but M+ something else. Let me think again. The molecular ion is at 156, which is the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. Let me compute the formula for each option:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Formula: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7×12=84, 5×1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2×16=32. Total: 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So M is 156.5.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula: C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. C6H4ClO3. Molecular weight: 6×12=72, 4×1=4, 35.5=35.5, 3×16=48. Total: 72+4=76+35.5=111.5+48=159.5.

So the molecular ion is 156, which matches options A, B, D. So their M is 156.5, which is close to 156. The M+2 is 158. So for each of these, the M+2 would be due to Cl. So the peak at m/z=158 would be about 3% of the M peak. But in the data, the M+2 is 32% of the M. That's a big difference. So maybe I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's not Cl. Maybe another element. Let me see: 32% of the M. Cl has a natural abundance of about 3% for M+2. So 32% is 10 times higher. That suggests that perhaps there's another Cl in the molecule or perhaps another isotope effect. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula isn't matching, and the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2. Let me compute that: 8×12=96, 7×1=7, 35.5=35.5, 2×16=32. Total: 96+7=103+35.5=138.5+32=170.5. That's higher. So no.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a double bond. Let me think about the option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula C6H4ClO3. Molecular weight is 6*12=72, 4=4, 35.5=35.5, 3*16=48. 72+4=76, +35.5=111.5, +48=159.5. So M is 159.5, but the data is 156. So that's not a fit.

Hmm. Another angle: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. What functional groups have that? Ester: around 1740-1720. Amide: about 1680-1700. Acid: 1700. So 1720 is more like an ester or maybe an acid chloride, but the M is 156, which doesn't fit acid chloride.

Wait, phenyl chloroformate would have a carbonyl around 1720 because it's an ester (maybe a bit higher than regular esters). Let me think about the structure: Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the carbonyl would be part of an ester group, which typically absorbs around 1740 cm^-1. But the given IR is 1720, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonate. Wait, but that's not one of the options.

Let me go back to the NMR. The 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so 11.0 seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol or a carboxylic acid. Phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm as singlets, but in the case of a para-substituted phenol, perhaps the proton is more deshielded.

Wait, but in the options, option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a phenol group (OH at position 2) and an aldehyde (CHO at position 1), and Cl at position 3. So the NMR would have an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm), a phenol OH (broad around 5 ppm), and aromatic protons. But the given NMR data doesn't show a peak around 5 ppm. Instead, it shows a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR would have a singlet for the Cl-CO-O group, but wait, the chloroformate group is O-CO-Cl, but in this structure, it's O-Ph-CO-Cl. Wait, the structure would have an O linked to the benzene, then COCl. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as a singlet if para-disubstituted. Wait, no. Wait, for phenyl chloroformate, the substituents are O-COCl and maybe another group? No, wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the benzene ring is attached to an O, which is connected to COCl. So the substituent on the benzene is O-COCl. That's a single substituent, so the aromatic ring would have one substituent. So the aromatic protons would be a triplet? No, wait, if the substituent is in the para position, the ring would have a substituent at position 1, and the rest would be in ortho and meta positions. So the NMR would show a singlet for the aromatic protons? No, benzene is symmetric, so if the substituent is at position 1, the protons would be equivalent at positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5, and 4. So maybe two doublets and a singlet. But the given NMR only has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the substituents are COOH and Cl at positions 1 and 4. So the aromatic ring would have four protons: two at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to COOH, and two at positions 3 and 5, adjacent to Cl.

In that case, the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons next to COOH (downfield, higher ppm) and another for those next to Cl (less downfield, lower ppm). So 8.02 would be the ones next to COOH, and 7.72 next to Cl. The singlet at 11 ppm would be the COOH proton.

But in that case, the molecular weight is 156.5, which matches the molecular ion at 156. But the M+2 is at 158, which is 32% of M. The expected M+2 should be 3% due to Cl. So that's a discrepancy. Maybe the M+2 is not due to Cl. Could it be something else?

Wait, maybe the molecule has a double bond, which would lead to M+2 due to 13C. Because 13C is about 1.1% abundant. But 32% is way higher than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 is due to sulfur or another element with a higher isotope abundance. But the options don't include sulfur.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the M is 156, and M+2 is 158. If the molecule has one Cl, the M is 156 (35Cl), and M+2 is 37Cl, which is about 3% of M. But the data shows M+2 as 32%, which is about 10 times higher than expected. So that would suggest that there are two Cl atoms, each contributing 3% M+2. 3% * 2 = 6%, which is still lower than 32%. Hmm, alternative possibilities.

Wait, maybe the M is at 156, and the M+2 is from another isotope. For example, if the molecule has two Cl atoms, then M would be 156 (35Cl) and M+2 would be 158 (35Cl and 37Cl), but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a bromine, but bromine's M+2 would be even higher.

Alternatively, maybe the M+2 is not an isotope but another fragment. Maybe a fragment loses something to give a peak at 158. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the options again, ignoring the M+2 for a moment.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. IR shows a strong carbonyl, which fits. The NMR has two doublets in aromatic region, which fits. The singlet at 11 ppm is the COOH proton. The M is 156.5, which matches the data. But the M+2 is 32%, which is way higher than expected for Cl.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the molecular formula is different. Let's compute the molecular weight again. For option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C7H6ClO2? No, that would be 7×12=84, 6=6, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+6=90+35.5=125.5+32=157.5. So M would be 158. But the data shows M at 156, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the molecular formula. Let me recheck.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid (C7H6O2) with a Cl replacing a H. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12×7=84, 5×1=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So M is 156.5, which would appear as 156 in the mass spec. The M+2 would be 158, but that's 3% of M, not 32%.

So this is conflicting. Perhaps the M+2 is not due to Cl, but another factor. Maybe it's due to something else in the molecule, like a double bond or another functional group.

Wait, another angle: the singlet at 11 ppm. Could it be an aldehyde proton? But earlier I thought aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high. But maybe in certain environments, it could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but I don't think any of the options have a ketone.

Wait, option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl is part of an ester group. So the NMR would have the aromatic protons as a singlet? No, because the substituent is at one position. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at one position (the O-CO-Cl group). So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, perhaps. Let me imagine the structure: the benzene ring with an O-CO-Cl group attached. The substituent is at position 1, so the ring would have substituent at 1, and protons at positions 2,3,4,5,6. But because of the substituent, the ring would be deshielded. However, the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons would be downfield.

Wait, but for phenyl chloroformate, the substituent is O-CO-Cl. So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in the range of about 7.5-8.5 ppm. But since the substituent is in the para position, the protons would be split into two sets. Or perhaps the substituent is in the para position, but wait, phenyl chloroformate is just O-CO-Cl attached to benzene. So the substituent is in one position, making the ring have a single substituent. So the aromatic protons would be split into a triplet or something else, but the data shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests two substituents, para to each other.

Ah, so phenyl chloroformate doesn't fit the NMR data because it would have only one substituent on the benzene ring, leading to a different splitting pattern.

So going back, the only option that fits the NMR aromatic data is option B or D (4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid), as they have two substituents on the ring, para to each other. So their aromatic protons would split into two doublets.

But the M+2 peak is an issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the M+2 peak is not due to Cl but due to another factor, like a double bond. For example, if the molecule has a double bond, you can have M+2 due to 13C. But 13C is about 1.1% abundant. So the M+2 would be about 1.1% of M. But the data shows 32%, which is way higher. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 is from the presence of another element. For example, if the molecule has a sulfur atom, but none of the options include sulfur. Option C has Cl and O but no sulfur.

Wait, perhaps the M+2 is from the loss of a fragment. For example, the molecular ion could lose a fragment and produce a peak at 158. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, and the M+2 is at 158, but the molecule has two Cl atoms. Let's check that. For option B, molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. If it had two Cls, M would be 156 + 35.5 = 191.5, which doesn't match. So that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe the M+2 isn't related to Cl. Let me think about the IR. The peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong and sharp. A sharp peak suggests a symmetrical carbonyl group, like an ester. Because in an acid, if it's -COOH, the peak is a bit broader due to hydrogen bonding. But an ester's carbonyl is often sharper.

So if the IR suggests an ester, then option C (phenyl chloroformate) would be a better fit. But wait, the NMR doesn't fit.

Phenyl chloroformate would have a structure of Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as a triplet or something else because the substituent is O-CO-Cl. Wait, no, the substituent is at one position, so the ring would have two sets of protons: ortho and para. But phenyl chloroformate is a mono-substituted benzene. So the NMR would show a triplet for the aromatic protons, but the data shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests two substituents. So option C's NMR doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. If it's an aldehyde, that's too high. If it's a carboxylic acid, then that's correct. So the IR would show a strong carbonyl, which fits. So perhaps the molecule is a benzoic acid derivative.

So despite the M+2 discrepancy, option B seems to fit the other data.

Wait, perhaps the M+2 is due to another factor. Let me calculate the exact molecular weight of option B: C7H5ClO2.

C:7×12=84, H:5×1=5, Cl:35.5, O:32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5.

So M is 156.5. The M+2 would be 158.5, which is 37Cl (35Cl +2). The abundance of 37Cl is about 3%, so the M+2 peak should be about 3% of the M peak. But the data shows M+2 at 32%, which is way higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H5ClO2? No, that would be C6H5ClO2. Molecular weight:6×12=72, 5=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 72+5=77+35.5=112.5+32=144.5. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecular ion is not the molecular weight. Perhaps it's M+ something else. Like M+H or M+Na. But the data says molecular ion peak at 156. So it's likely the molecular weight.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider each option again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: M at 156, M+2 at 158 (32%). Doesn't fit with Cl.

But the other data fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The substituents are at 1 and 2. So the ring's protons would be at 3 (adjacent to Cl and COOH?), 4 (meta to Cl and COOH?), 5, and 6.

Wait, in this case, the aromatic protons would be split into more complex patterns. Let me imagine the structure. The substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring's protons at 3 would be between Cl and COOH, which would make them deshielded. The protons at 4 would be opposite the COOH group, and 5 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH. Actually, in this case, the aromatic protons would not form two doublets each of 2H. They might form more complex splitting.

So the NMR for option D might not fit the given data, which has two doublets each of 2H.

So perhaps option B is the better fit, despite the mass spec issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 isn't Cl. Let's think about another possibility. Maybe the molecule has a deuterated something. No, that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the M+2 is due to a double bond, but in that case, the molecule would have a double bond, which isn't indicated in any of the options except possibly option C.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR for aromatic protons would be a singlet? No, because it's a mono-substituted benzene. So the aromatic protons would be split into a triplet or something else. But the given data has two doublets, each 2H.

So I'm stuck between option B and the M+2 issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2 with a molecular weight of 156.5, and the M+2 at 158 is due to both the natural abundance of Cl and something else. Wait, but 3% is not 32%.

Alternatively, perhaps the data's M+2 is not an isotope but a fragment. For example, perhaps the molecule loses a HCl molecule, but that would lower the molecular weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 is from something else. Let me think about the mass difference. 158-156=2. So a mass increase of 2. That could be due to a double bond (which would be 2 H less, but that's a loss, not a gain). Alternatively, perhaps it's from a deuterated molecule, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the M+2 is due to a +CH2 group? No, that's 14 mass units.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 is from a +O2 or something, but that's 32 mass units.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the M+2 part. Let me focus on the other data.

The IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720, which is more like an ester. So option C would fit that. But the NMR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 11 ppm is a chlorine atom attached to something else. Wait, Cl in an aromatic ring doesn't have protons. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 could be from a chloroformate group (O-CO-Cl). Chloroformate esters have strong carbonyl peaks around 1720-1750 cm^-1. So that fits. But the NMR of option C would have aromatic protons as a triplet or something else, not two doublets each of 2H.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is in the para position. No, option C has the substituent in one position.

Another angle: the broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That suggests an -OH group. If it's a phenol, the peak would be around 3500 cm^-1, broad. But the given IR data doesn't specify a broad peak, just a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a wide range, which could indicate either an -OH or an -NH group. But in the options, only option A has an -OH (as a phenol), and option B has a -COOH.

Wait, carboxylic acids have broad peaks around 2500-3300 cm^-1 due to O-H stretch. So the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 would include the O-H stretch. So that's consistent with either a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

So going back to the NMR. The singlet at 11 ppm would fit a carboxylic acid, but not a phenol. Because phenols typically have protons around 5 ppm. So the singlet at 11 suggests a carboxylic acid.

So that points to options B or D.

Now, considering the M+2 issue. The data's M+2 is 32% of M, which is much higher than the expected 3% for Cl. That suggests that perhaps the molecule has more than one Cl, but all the options have only one Cl. So that's a problem.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the M+2 is due to a different isotope. For example, for option B, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. The mass is 156.5. The M+2 at 158 would be 37Cl (35Cl + 2). So the M+2 should be 3% of M. But the data shows 32%, which is 10 times that. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a dimer or has another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the M is 156, and the M+2 is something else, like the parent plus a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 isn't from Cl but from another element. Wait, 158 - 156 = 2. So perhaps it's a +2 fragment. For example, adding a deuterium or something, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the M+2 is due to Cl, even though the percentage seems off, and see which option fits the other data.

So the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But wait, let me check the NMR again. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, so they're more downfield. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, so less downfield.

In the NMR, the higher ppm (8.02) would be protons at 2 and 6, and the lower ppm (7.72) would be at 3 and 5. So each is a doublet because they're adjacent to one substituent each. So the splitting would be as observed.

So, with that, despite the M+2 discrepancy, the other data fits option B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Mass Spectral Data:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: Indicates the molecular weight is approximately 156.
- **Peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: Suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as the M+2 peak is consistent with the natural abundance of $^{37}\text{Cl}$ ($\approx 3\%$). However, the observed 32% abundance is unusually high, which raises some concerns but is tentatively attributed to chlorine.

### IR Spectral Data:
- **Broad peak from 3500–2700 cm$^-$**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm$^-$**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.

### $^1$H NMR Data:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet at this chemical shift is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring. The higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm) corresponds to protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the lower shift (7.72 ppm) corresponds to protons adjacent to the chlorine atom.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains an aldehyde group (-CHO), which would produce an NMR signal around 9–10 ppm. However, the observed singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.  
   - Additionally, the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the para-substitution observed in the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated**.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular weight (156.5) matches the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  
   - The M+2 peak at m/z = 158 is consistent with the natural abundance of $^{37}\text{Cl}$.  
   - The NMR data fits perfectly: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the -COOH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons adjacent to the -COOH and Cl groups, respectively.  
   - **Fits all data**.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph).  
   - The molecular weight (159.5) does not match the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  
   - The NMR data does not fit, as phenyl chloroformate would show a different splitting pattern for the aromatic protons due to mono-substitution.  
   - **Eliminated**.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - The molecular weight matches the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  
   - However, the NMR data does not fit, as the aromatic splitting pattern for a meta-substituted ring would be more complex than the two doublets observed.  
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, particularly the NMR and IR, strongly support **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the correct structure. The M+2 peak at 32% is unusual but can be tentatively attributed to the natural abundance of $^{37}\text{Cl}$, considering the molecular formula and other spectral evidence.
