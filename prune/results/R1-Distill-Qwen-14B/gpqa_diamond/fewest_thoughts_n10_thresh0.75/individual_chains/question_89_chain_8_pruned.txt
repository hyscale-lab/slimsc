Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, various reagents are used, and the product after each step is analyzed. The final question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **First Reaction**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, a light yellow solid. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The ¹H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). 

Hmm, KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with it, usually elimination (E2) happens, forming alkenes. But wait, if it's a dibromide, maybe it's a di-elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds?), or perhaps a conjugated diene? Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr from each end. Maybe it forms an alkene.

Wait, but if two HBr molecules are lost, maybe it forms a di-ene? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a ketone? Wait, the IR has 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. That makes me think it's a elimination followed by some oxidation, but wait, KOH is a base, not oxidizing. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but then maybe the structure is such that it leads to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene, but how would that lead to a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a
