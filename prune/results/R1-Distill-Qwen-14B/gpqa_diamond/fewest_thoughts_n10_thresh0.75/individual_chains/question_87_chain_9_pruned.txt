Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let me break this down. So the compound is an aromatic ring with six members, like benzene, but it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached. The total number of carbons is 8. Since benzene has six carbons, the substituents must add two more carbons. Wait, no, because di-substituted would add two substituents, each possibly having multiple carbons. Wait, the total is 8, so the ring itself is 6 carbons, so the substituents together add 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon group? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, because di-substituted implies two substituents, so each substituent must be one carbon, but that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe each substituent is a single atom, like halogens? Because halogens (like Cl or Br) don't contribute a carbon.

Wait, but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (like an acetyl group) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe an acetyl group, which is -COCH3), or maybe a carbonyl as in a carbonyl group attached directly, but that would require a substituent like a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group or something else.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6 carbons. If the substituents are an acetyl group (which is -COCH3, adding 2 carbons) and a halogen (which doesn't add any carbons, like Cl), then the total carbons
