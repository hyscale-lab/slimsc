Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. They've given the form of Ay as c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh wait, I remember that S here probably represents the spin matrices, maybe analogous to the Pauli matrices. 

So the matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Wait a second, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. 

The operator Ay is then (h/(4π)) times this Pauli Y matrix. And we're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. But wait, since Ay is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix, maybe I can use some properties of Pauli matrices to make this easier. 

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, no, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but I think when you scale them by a constant, the eigenvalues get scaled by that same factor. So S has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Then, multiplying by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * 1 = h/(4π) and c * (-1) = -h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues I'm getting are purely real: ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, which means the imaginary parts would be zero. So perhaps option A is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts, which are zero in this case. 

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense either because from my calculation, the eigenvalues are real. So the imaginary part is zero, so B is probably wrong. 

Now, the next part: what about the eigenvectors? Well, the eigenvectors of the Pauli Y matrix are the same as those for the spin in the Y-direction. The standard eigenvectors are like |+y> and |-y>, which are (1, i)/√2 and (1, -i)/√2, perhaps. 

Wait, but the question is about the statements provided. Let's look at the options again. 

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Well, I know that for angular momentum operators, any component's eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum (since A² commutes with all components). So if Ay has an eigenstate, then A² should have the same eigenstate because A² is a scalar (proportional to identity matrix for spin-½ particles). So option C might be correct in that part. But it says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Is that true?

Wait, for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az. So if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's a linear combination of |+z> and |-z>, meaning it's not an eigenstate of Az. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az because they're not aligned with the z-axis. So option C's first part, about A², is correct. So C could be a correct statement. 

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of a matrix operator... I think that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but since Ay is 2x2, the eigenvectors will form an orthonormal basis. So any vector can be expressed as a combination of the eigenvectors. But I'm not sure if that's what option D is getting at. The statement seems a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should focus on the possible eigenvalue outcomes. 

Wait, are the eigenvalues purely real? Because Ay is a Hermitian operator. Let me double-check. The matrix S is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is Hermitian because S^\dagger = S. Then Ay is c*S, so it's also Hermitian because c is real. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real, which rules out options A and B, which mention imaginary parts. So options A and B can't be correct. 

Looking back at options C and D. So which is correct? 

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part, about not being eigenfunctions of Az, is also correct because the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of eigenstates of Az. So option C is a correct statement. 

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, but the basis functions of the operator might refer to the standard basis. I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the statement might imply that the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis vectors of Ay. But I'm not certain about that. 

So based on this, the correct statement is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay will be eigenfunctions of A², and they won't be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix: 

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**  
   The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), giving \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian (as \( S \) is Hermitian and \( c \) is real). This rules out **Options A and B**, which incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**  
   The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) correspond to the eigenstates of the \( Y \)-component of spin. These eigenstates are superpositions of the eigenstates of \( A_z \), meaning they are not eigenstates of \( A_z \). This supports the second part of **Option C**, which states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \):**  
   The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of \( A \), including \( A_y \). Therefore, any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). This supports the first part of **Option C**, making it a correct statement.

4. **Option D:**  
   While the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, the phrasing "the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \)" is ambiguous and less precise than the statement in **Option C**. Thus, **Option D** is not the best choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
