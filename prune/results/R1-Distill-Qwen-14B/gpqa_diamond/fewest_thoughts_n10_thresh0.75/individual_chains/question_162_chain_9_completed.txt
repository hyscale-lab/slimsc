Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's expressed in terms of dx and dy. So this is a 2D spacetime? Or maybe just a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions. Since the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, this might be a hyperbolic space.

I remember that the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model or the upper half-plane model. The given metric seems similar to the Poincaré disk model. The general form for the Poincaré disk model with radius a is ds² = (4a²)/( (1 - (x² + y²)/a²)^2 ) (dx² + dy²). Wait, let me check that. Oh no, wait, the denominator would be (1 - r²/a²) where r is the radial coordinate. So perhaps for a disk of radius a, the metric has a denominator (a² - x² - y²) or something like that.

Wait, in the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me compute 4 as 2 squared. So perhaps a=2 in this case, because 4 is (2)^2. So if a=2, then the metric would be ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait, let me compare this with the standard Poincaré model. The standard model has a metric like ds² = (4a²)/( (1 - (x² + y²)/a²)² ) (dx² + dy²). Wait, maybe I'm getting the denominator wrong. Alternatively, another way to write the Poincaré disk metric is ds² = (a²)/( (a² - x² - y²)^2 ) (dx² + dy² + dz²) for 3D, but wait, that's for three dimensions. Oh, wait, no, the Poincaré disk is 2D, so maybe it's just (a²)/( (a² - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the given metric in polar coordinates to make it clearer. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². Substituting into the metric, ds² becomes [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the metric in polar form is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ². Hmm, comparing this to the standard hyperbolic metric, which is usually written as ds² = (a²/(a² - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) for the Poincaré disk. Wait, but in our case, the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²). So perhaps 32 is the a squared term multiplied by something.

Wait, let me think again. The standard Poincaré metric is ds² = (a²)/(a² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Here, the given metric has 32/(4 - r²) as the coefficient. So 32 must be equal to (a²)/(a² - r²)^2 multiplied by (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the given metric, the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²) for dr² and similarly for the angular component. So the overall coefficient for the line element is 32/(4 - r²), which would be the same as (something)^2 multiplied by the standard hyperbolic metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not in the standard form. Maybe I should figure out the Gaussian curvature from the metric to determine if it's a pseudosphere.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K of a 2D metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ² (assuming no cross terms) can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2√(EG))) * [ ∂/∂r ( (1/√(EG)) ∂E/∂θ ) + ∂/∂θ ( (1/√(EG)) ∂G/∂r ) ]

Wait, but since E and G don't depend on θ here (since it's the Poincaré disk model), this might simplify. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recall that for the Poincaré disk of radius a, the Gaussian curvature is -1/a². So if the given metric is a hyperbolic metric, its Gaussian curvature is constant and negative, which would make it a pseudosphere.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the Gaussian curvature for the given metric. The metric in polar coordinates is ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², where A(r) =32/(4 - r²) and B(r)=32/(4 - r²).

Wait, so E=A(r)=32/(4−r²), and G = B(r) r²= (32/(4−r²)) r². Since E and G are both functions of r, but not θ, then the formula for K would be K = - (1/(2√(E G))) [ (∂/∂r (∂E/∂θ) ) + (∂/∂θ (∂G/∂r) ) ] / ...

Wait, but since E and G don't depend on θ, the partial derivatives with respect to θ would be zero. So the formula for K might be simplified.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r E)) [ ∂/∂r (E r) ) ] 

Wait, I think I remember a simpler formula when the metric is diagonal and axisymmetric.

Yes, for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature is:

K = - (1/(2 r √(A B))) ) * d/dr (√(A B) * r )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, let me think about the general expression for Gaussian curvature in 2D. For a metric ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², the curvature is given by:

K = - [ g_{rr}'' + (g_{rr}')/(2 r) ) ] / (g_{rr})^{1/2} } 

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Christoffel symbols and then the Ricci scalar.

But maybe it's easier to note that the given metric is conformally flat. Since it's in 2D, any metric can be written as ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²). In this case, f(r) = 32/(4 - r²). 

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²) is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r f(r))) ) * d/dr ( r f(r) )

Wait, let me compute that. So first compute r f(r):

r f(r) = r * [32/(4 - r²)] = (32 r)/(4 - r²)

Then, take the derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ (32 r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ 32*(4 - r²) + 32 r*(2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2 
Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute that derivative again. Using the quotient rule: numerator is (32 r) and denominator is (4 - r²). So derivative is [32*(4 - r²) - 32 r*(-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, so:

d/dr [ (32 r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [32*(4 - r²) + 64 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2
= [128 - 32 r² + 64 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2
= [128 + 32 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2
= 32 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, substitute into the formula for K:

K = - [1/(2 r f(r)) ] * [32 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ]

But f(r) is 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(f(r)) = (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = - [1/(2 r * (32/(4 - r²))) ) ] * [32 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ]

Simplify denominator terms:

1/(2 r * (32/(4 - r²))) ) = (4 - r²)/(64 r )

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64 r) ) ] * [32 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ]

Simplify:

The (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator cancels out once, leaving:

= - [1/(64 r) ) ] * [32 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²) ]

32 is 32, so 32 over 64 is 1/2.

So:

= - [ ( (4 + r²) ) / ( (2 r)(4 - r²) ) ) ]

Hmm, that's K. So K = - (4 + r²) / [ 2 r (4 - r²) ) ]

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be a constant negative value, right? Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. But the expression I've got for K depends on r, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant. That can't be right; maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in applying the formula. Alternatively, maybe the metric isn't for the entire hyperbolic plane but for a finite area. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but wait, the radius r in the metric is a radial coordinate, perhaps up to a certain maximum value. The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive, so 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r<2. So the maximum r is 2. So the radial coordinate goes up to r=2, and beyond that, the metric becomes singular.

So perhaps this is the Poincaré disk model with a=2, where the maximum radius is a=2. But in the standard Poincaré model, the radius a is the radius of the disk, but the hyperbolic plane extends infinitely beyond that. Wait, but in our case, the metric is only defined for r<2, so perhaps this is a finite area, like a hyperbolic cap.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, but in this case, the metric is only defined up to r=2, so maybe the area is finite.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area of this space. The area can be found by integrating the area element over the entire space. The area element in polar coordinates is given by sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) (dr dθ). Wait, but since this is a 2D metric, the area element is just sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ. But wait, in our case, the metric is ds² = E dr² + F dθ², so the square root of E*F would be the area element's measure.

Wait, our E(r) is 32/(4 - r²), and F(r) is (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is sqrt( E * F ) dr dθ = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ.

Compute this:

sqrt( (32 * 32 r² ) / ( (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = sqrt( 1024 r² / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

So dA = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The area would be the integral of dA over all r and θ. θ goes from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2, since beyond r=2 the metric is singular.

So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

First, integrate over r:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u → -16 ∫ (du/u).

Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). Wait, when r=2, u=4−4=0. So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (du/u) ) = -16 [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

But wait, as u approaches 0 from above, ln u approaches -infinity. So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → which seems to approach positive infinity because of the negative sign.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution limits. Let me re-do the substitution.

When r=0, u=4 - 0 =4.

When r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 =0.

So the integral:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4−r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r/(4−r²) dr ]

Let u=4−r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ (r dr) / (4−r²) ) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du/u ] from u=4 to u=0.

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (du/u )

= -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

But evaluating from u=4 to u=0 is the same as [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

ln(0) is negative infinity, so:

-16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → -16 ( -infty ) → positive infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because the area of a pseudosphere should be finite, right? Because a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent but finite area—like a horn. Or wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the hyperbolic plane with the pseudosphere.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The pseudosphere is a finite area surface with infinite extent, similar to how a cylinder has infinite length but finite area if you consider a unit cylinder over a finite interval.

Wait, but in our case, the integration from r=0 to r=2 gives an area element that, when integrated, becomes infinite. So that suggests the area is infinite. But that doesn't seem right because a pseudosphere has finite area.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, maybe the metric provided isn't correctly representing a pseudosphere. Or perhaps the given metric is for a finite portion, not the entire pseudosphere.

Wait, the question says "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Wait, no, pseudospheres don't have a radius in the same way as spheres. Wait, perhaps it's a typo and they mean a hyperbolic sphere or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic space of curvature leading to finite area.

Wait, but back to the calculation. The area integral is giving me an infinite result because the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent as r approaches 2, because the denominator approaches zero.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in computing the area element. Let me double-check.

The area element in 2D is sqrt( g_rr * g_θθ ) dr dθ. For our metric, g_rr is 32/(4−r²), and g_θθ is (32 r²)/(4−r²). So multiplying them gives:

g_rr * g_θθ = (32/(4−r²)) * (32 r²/(4−r²)) ) = (32 * 32 r²) / (4−r²)^2.

So sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) = sqrt( (1024 r²)/(4−r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4−r²).

So that's correct.

So the integral over r from 0 to 2 is ∫ (32 r)/(4−r²) dr. As r approaches 2, the integrand behaves like (32*2)/(4−4) = 64/0, which goes to infinity. So the integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

Let me compute this integral exactly.

Let me consider substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2 ) ) / u = -16 ∫ (du/u )

Which is -16 ln|u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0):

At r=2, u=0. So ln(0) is -infty. So when we evaluate from u=4 to u=0, it's:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → -16*(-infty) → +infty.

So the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

Wait, but the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the area is infinite, then the answer would be D.

But I'm a bit concerned because I thought pseudospheres have finite area, but perhaps that's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the metric given isn't correctly representing a pseudosphere.

Wait, another approach: the metric given looks like it's a two-dimensional space with a singularity at r=2. The area up to r=2 would be infinite, which would make the answer D) +infty.

So the area is infinite.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. To analyze the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first convert the metric to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). The metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \( g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) and \( g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} \). Thus:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \( dA \) over the entire domain of \( r \) and \( \theta \). The radial coordinate \( r \) is restricted to \( 0 \leq r < 2 \), as the metric becomes singular at \( r = 2 \). The angular coordinate \( \theta \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The area integral is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( r \):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-du/2}{u} = -16 \int_{4}^{0} \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_{4}^{0} = -16 \left[ \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right].
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
