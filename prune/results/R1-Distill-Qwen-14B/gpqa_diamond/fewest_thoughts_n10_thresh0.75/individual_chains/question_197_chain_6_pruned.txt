Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI elimination reaction, but wait, more specifically, I think it's the Clemmensen reduction. No, wait, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg)/HCl and H2SO4, right? Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is for eliminating carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, converting them into methylene groups. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl and treat it with H2O/HI and red phosphorus, it might be the formation of an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Let me think. Oh, wait! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes from aldehydes or ketones through the elimination of water. Or perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester? Wait, maybe I should focus first on identifying what compound X is.

The IR data: Looking at the peaks. The strong peak around 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests the presence
