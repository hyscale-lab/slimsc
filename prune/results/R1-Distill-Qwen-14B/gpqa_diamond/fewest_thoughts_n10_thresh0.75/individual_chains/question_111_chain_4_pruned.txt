Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose the major products for each, then pick the option that matches both. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A and B.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this probably isn't a typical acid-catalyzed reaction. Maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of enolate formation.

The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. Let me draw the structure quickly. The ketone is at position 1 (so the carbonyl is at C1). Then, substituents: 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. At C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl—so 2 has an ethyl and a methyl). Then C6 also has a methyl. So the structure would have the carbonyl at C1, C2 has ethyl and methyl, and C6 has methyl. So it's like:

Structure:
Positions 1 (C=O), 2 (CH2CH2CH3 and CH3?), wait no. Wait, 2-ethyl is one substituent, 2,6-dimethyl—so at position 2, two substituents: ethyl and methyl. And position 6 has a methyl.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclo
