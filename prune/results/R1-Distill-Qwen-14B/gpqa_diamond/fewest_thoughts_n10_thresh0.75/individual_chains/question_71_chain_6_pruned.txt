Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I think for this problem, the method of discovery might not be directly relevant. 

The key details here are that there are five planets, all in orbital resonance with circular orbits. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, let me note down the ratios:

Planet_1: 1
Planet_2: 2
Planet_3: 2.5
Planet_4: 3.5
Planet_5: 5

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so albedo isn't a factor here. 

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is:

T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π^2 * σ * a^2) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation and the fourth power for the blackbody radiation. Oh right, the formula is usually given as:

T_planet = T_star * ( ( (1 - A) / (16 * π) ) )^(1/4) * ( ( L ) / (4πσ a^2) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, perhaps a simpler way. Since all the planets are around the same star and have the same albedo (A), and assuming the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square of the orbital distance. 

Wait, the formula I remember is:

T = T_earth * ( (1 AU / a )^(1/2) ) * ( ( L / L_sun ) )^(1/4 )

Wait, maybe I should use the formula that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). Since L (star's luminosity) and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for all planets, the temperature depends on a^(-1/2),
