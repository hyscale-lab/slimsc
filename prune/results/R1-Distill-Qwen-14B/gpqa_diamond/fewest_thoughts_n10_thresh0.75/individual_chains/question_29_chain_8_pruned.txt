Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar. It's good because it can handle droughts, but the problem is it has an anti-nutritional compound. That compound makes it impossible to use the barley for food. So they found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The question gives the intact gene sequence and four mutant sequences, each showing changes in the first exon area. We need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the compound. The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So, the key here is probably to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, the gene probably codes for a protein that produces it. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made, making the barley usable.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene is in uppercase, and the mutants have lowercase changes. Let me write them out more clearly.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let me note the positions where each mutant differs.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, it looks like the 4th and 5th nucleotides change. The intact has 'TT', while mutant 1 has 'CT'. Then, at a later part, the last part shows 'GC' instead of 'GT' in the intact. Wait, no, let me look more carefully.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So the first part: positions 4 and 5. Intact is 'TT', mutant is 'CT'.

Then, further down, looking at the end, the intact has ...GTCGT…, and mutant 1 has ...GTCGC… So position where the last part changes is the last nucleotide before TGA. The intact has a G, mutant has a C.

So the changes are: at position 4-5, TT → CT, and at position near the end, GT → GC.

What about Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, first part is ATGTTCTAAGC... vs ATGTTTCTCGC. So in the first part, it's changed. Let me see:

Intact: after ATG, it's TTTCTC..., and mutant is TTCTAA. So at positions 4-7 perhaps? Because the fourth nucleotide might be the first 'T' in TTT.

Wait, the sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 2 is 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part: intact has ATG TTT CTC GCG..., mutant 2 has ATG TTC TAA GCT...

So the first part is: after ATG, intact has TTTCTC..., mutant has TTCTAA. So the nucleotides after ATG are changing.

Wait, maybe I should count the positions. Let me write the first part as:

Intact: positions 1-20 (just for example)
1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
... etc.

Mutant 1: position 4 is T in intact, but in mutant 1 it's C. So that's a point mutation. Similarly, the last part, position after ...GTCGT..., it's changed to GC.

Mutant 2: I think the first part has a change where the third C becomes an A, but wait, the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG...
Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT ...

Hmm, so the fourth nucleotide after ATG is T in intact (position 4), and in mutant 2 it's C? Let me look again.

Wait, the first part of intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG... So after ATG, it's TTTCTCGCTGG... So positions 4,5,6,7,8,9
