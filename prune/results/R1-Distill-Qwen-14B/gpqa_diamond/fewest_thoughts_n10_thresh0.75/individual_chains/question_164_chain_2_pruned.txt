Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2, with different eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. I need to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, the first thing I remember is that in binary systems, the radial velocity (RV) of each star is related to the mass ratio. Oh right, the more massive star will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving less. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the less massive star moves more, hence higher RV amplitude.

The problem gives the RV amplitudes for each system. For system_1, the stars have RVs of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So let me think: the more massive star would have the smaller velocity. So the star moving at 5 km/s is more massive than the one moving at 10 km/s? Wait wait, no, wait. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. Because the product of mass and velocity is the same for both stars (since momentum is conserved, the center of mass is stationary). So m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So if v1 is 10 and v2 is 5, then m1/m2 would be v2/v1. So m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 1:2. So m1 is half of m2. Wait, but wait, in the system, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So the star with higher velocity is less massive.

Wait another approach. Let me think about the mass function. Oh wait, but maybe I should consider the mass ratio. Alternatively, since the two stars in the binary system orbit each other, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So the mass ratio is (v2)/(v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio q = m2/m1 = v1/v2 = 10/5 = 2. So m2 is twice m1. So total mass of system
