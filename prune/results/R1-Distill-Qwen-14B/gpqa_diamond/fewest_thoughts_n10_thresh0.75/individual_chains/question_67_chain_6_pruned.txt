Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield eigenvalues of -ħ. So, the eigenvalues for L1z and L2z would each be -ħ times their respective m values. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalues for Lz are m multiplied by ħ. So for an electron in an l=1 orbital, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So the possible Lz eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

But in this problem, we're ignoring the spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. But wait, wait. The total m is the sum of the individual m's, right? So m = m1 + m2. Because when you couple two angular momenta, the total m is the sum of the individual m's.

Wait, but in the given state, it's |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But m = m1 + m2. So for each electron, their m1 and m2 values add up to -1.

The problem is asking for the probability that, when measuring L1z and L2z, both are -ħ. So that would mean each of their m1 and m2 is -1. Because L1z |m1> = m1 ħ |m1>, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

Wait, but wait: in
