Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is provided as a column vector, and the matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm. So, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation value of P_z squared and subtract the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root.

Wait, but wait. The state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh wait, no, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is given in that basis. That's probably important because it means that the components of the state vector directly correspond to the eigenstates of P_z.

Let me think. The state is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. So, in the P_z basis, each component is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate.

The operator P_z's matrix is diagonal, I believe. Because it's given as first row: (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So, the basis states |1>, |2>, |3> correspond to these eigenvalues.

Since the state is given in this basis, calculating the expectation value of P_z is straightforward. The expectation value is the sum of |amplitude|² multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the weighted average.

Let me write down the components. The state vector has three components: a1 = -1/2, a2 = 1/sqrt(2), a3 = -1/2. So, their squares are (1/4), (1/2), and (1/4) respectively.

Wait, no. The square of the absolute value of each component. Since these are real numbers, the square is just the square of the component.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:

⟨P_z⟩ = |a1|² * (ħ) + |a2|² * 0 + |a3|² * (-ħ).

Calculating each term:

|a1|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ = ħ/4.

|a2|² = (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2. But since the middle eigenvalue is 0, this term contributes nothing.

|a3|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue -ħ: (1/4)*(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Summing all terms: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So the matrix for P_z² will have (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2 on the diagonal, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a1|²*(ħ)^2 + |a2|²*0 + |a3|²*(ħ)^2.

Calculating each term:

|a1|² * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

|a3|² * ħ² = (1
