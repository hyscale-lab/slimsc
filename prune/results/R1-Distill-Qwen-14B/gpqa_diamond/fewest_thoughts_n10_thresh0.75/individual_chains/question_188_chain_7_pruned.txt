Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I think refers to the lattice parameter 'a' because in a rhombohedral structure, each edge is the same length.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Let me try to recall the formula.

Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(something) ). Wait, no, that's for a cubic system. But rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh wait, maybe the formula is more general. I think the general formula for interplanar distance when the lattice is not cubic is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * ( (1/a^2) (cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ - 2 cos α cos β cos γ) ) )^{-1} )

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula for a rhombohedral system is similar to the cubic case but adjusted for the angles
