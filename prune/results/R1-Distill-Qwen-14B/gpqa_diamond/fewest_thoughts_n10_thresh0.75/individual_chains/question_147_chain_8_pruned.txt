Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles, right? Like electrons and positrons annihilating into gamma rays. But this question is about protons and antiprotons annihilating into other particles.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So a proton and antiproton annihilate to produce two particles of A+ and two of A−. Interesting. I guess the key here is to figure out the velocity of particle A.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, that's important. So the antiproton's speed is much lower than the speed of light, which probably means we can use non-relativistic approximations here. But wait, when dealing with particle physics, even if something is moving slowly, sometimes you have to be careful because rest masses can play a big role.

We're given m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest mass energy of particle A is 300 MeV. But what about the masses of the proton and antiproton? I remember that the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², so same for antiproton since they're just the opposite.

Wait, but in the reaction, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are each approximately 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. But the products are four particles, each A has 300 MeV, so total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Hmm, that's less than the initial. But wait, in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is low. But then, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is low, and the products must carry away the energy. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low. Let me consider the center-of-momentum frame. Oh wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but not too high.

Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial system isn't at rest. Let me model this.
