Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Wow, that's a lot to unpack. Let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is a norbornene (since there are double bonds) with an ether substituent.

Then, it's reacting with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, the structure of that is a cyclohexadiene (since cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds at 1,3?), but wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, right? Wait, no, that's not possible because 1,3-diene would be alternating, but in a six-membered ring, it's conjugated. So positions 5 and 6 have dibromomethyl groups. So each of those positions has a -CH2Br2 group? Wait, no, bis(dibromomethyl) means each of the two groups is a dibromomethyl, which is CH2Br2. So each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups at positions 5 and 6.

So the reaction is between the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene, with sodium iodide. I'm trying to think what kind of reaction this is. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile and can act as a catalyst in some reactions. Wait, maybe it's an elimination reaction or an addition. Oh, wait, the norbornene has a double bond, and the other molecule is a diene as well. But considering the presence of Br2 in the substituents, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Because Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, norbornene is a good di
