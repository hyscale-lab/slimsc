Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with a compound and going through several steps to produce a final product, which is product 4. The question is about determining how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A to D, with numbers 4, 7, 8, 10.

First, I need to understand each step of the reaction and figure out what each product looks like, especially product 4. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure, which is a bicyclic compound. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure should have a bridge, and the oxygen is attached as an ether group to the bicyclic ring.

Next step, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, that sounds like an elimination reaction, maybe a substitution. Sodium iodide is often a nucleophile, but in the presence of a good leaving group, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction. But wait, the other compound has dibromomethyl groups. Oh, wait, dibromomethyl groups are -CH2Br2. So each of those positions is a CH2 with two bromine atoms.

Wait, but when you have two leaving groups on a CH2, like two bromines, perhaps the iodide could substitute one of them. Or maybe it's a eliminations reaction, like an E2? But the conditions are elevated temperature, which might favor elimination.

Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being a CH2Br2 group.

So when this reacts with the norbornene compound, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Since the starting norbornene is a diene. Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. But in this case, the other molecule is a cyclohexadiene, which is a conjugated diene. Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic diene. So perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. Another thought: when you have two equivalents of a dihalide, maybe it's a coupling reaction, like a Grignard or some cross-coupling. But with sodium iodide, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, norbornene has an oxygen substituent (tert-butoxy). When combined
