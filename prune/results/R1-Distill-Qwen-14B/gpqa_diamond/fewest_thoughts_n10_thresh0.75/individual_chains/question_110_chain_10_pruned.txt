Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that the question gives some details about each star's magnitude, distance, and some extinction values. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. Each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So a star must be bright enough (apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES) to be detected by both. Wait, no, actually, wait. Because the question says which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be below the limit for both instruments. Let me get that straight.

Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means if a star's V magnitude is 17 or lower (brighter), ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES), which is stricter. So the apparent magnitude has to be <=16, because 16 is brighter than 17. Oh wait, no: the lower the magnitude number, the brighter the star. So a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is at 16.5, it's dimmer than 16, which is the limit for HIRES. Because HIRES can only observe up to 16. So a star with apparent magnitude 16.5 would be too faint for HIRES, but okay for ESPRESSO.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me rephrase. The apparent V magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The lower the number, the brighter the star. So for a star to be observable by a spectrograph, its apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to the given limit. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17, HIRES up to V=16.

So for a star to be seen by both, it must have apparent V magnitude <=16 because that's the stricter limit. Because if it's <=16, it's definitely <=17. So the first thing I need to do is calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust that makes them appear dimmer).

Wait, but some stars have E(B-V) given, which is the color excess. The question says that total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So the extinction (A_V) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction (since extinction makes it appear dimmer, so higher magnitude). Wait, no, wait: when you have a star with an intrinsic magnitude M
