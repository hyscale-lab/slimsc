Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like finding exoplanets via the radial velocity method. But the question is about their detection limits.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16.5 V mag. Oh wait, actually, wait. The description says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be detected, because lower magnitude means brighter. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 (like 16 or 15), it's observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude <=16.5.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, that's the opposite. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, then ESPRESSO can detect it. Because apparent magnitude is how bright it appears to us. So for example, a star at 15 mag is brighter than 17, so detectable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16.5 mag (so apparent mag â‰¤16.5) can be detected.

So each star's apparent V magnitude is what determines if they can be detected by each instrument.

Wait, but some of the stars don't directly give us their apparent V magnitudes. Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude would be the same as the absolute magnitude if it's at 10 pc. So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5. So since 15.5 is less than 16.5 (HIRES limit) and less than 17 (ESPRESSO limit), it can be detected by both. So Star1 can be observed by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag is given as 16.5. So that's exactly at the HIRES limit (since HIRES can do up to 16.5). Wait, can it? If the limit is brighter than 16.5, then 16.5 is exactly the threshold. So would it be detected? Hmm, I think if the limit is 'brighter than 16.5', then 16.5 is the cutoff. So Star2 is 16.5, which is the edge. Maybe it's detectable by HIRES but not by ESPRESSO? Because HIRES can go up to 16.5, and Star2 is 16.5. Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So for ESPRESSO, Star2's mag is 16.5, which is brighter than 17, so it's observable. But for HIRES, the limit is 16.5. So if the star has apparent mag 16.5, it's right at the limit. I think in some cases, telescopes can observe up to and including the limit, but the question says 'brighter than' which is a bit ambiguous. It might depend on whether it's strictly less than or less than or equal.

Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So Star2's V mag is 16.5, which is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can detect it. For HIRES, it's Apparent V mag
