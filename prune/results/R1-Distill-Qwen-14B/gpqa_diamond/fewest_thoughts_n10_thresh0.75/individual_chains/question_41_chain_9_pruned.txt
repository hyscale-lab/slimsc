Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about a light beam moving through a glass slab, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame, and we need to find the speed of light relative to this observer. The options are A, B, C, D with different expressions.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, we might need to use velocity addition formulas, like the ones from special relativity. But wait, the speed of light in a medium isn't the same as in a vacuum, right? Oh wait, but the question specifies that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So, in the glass, the speed would be 1/n, because speed v = c/n. But wait—that's in the rest frame of the glass, right?

But the glass is moving relative to the lab. So, the observer in the lab would see the light moving at a different speed. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So, from the lab frame, the light's speed would be (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²), where v' is the velocity of the glass.

Wait, wait, no. Because the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Let me clarify the directions. The problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass; the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. But the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit conflicting. Wait, maybe the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion—so if the glass is
