Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm not super confident about the details. Let me think through this step by step.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So this is a 2-dimensional metric because it has dx² and dy² terms. But what kind of geometry is this?

I think this might represent a space with constant curvature. Because the metric looks similar to the one for a sphere but maybe scaled differently. Wait, the standard metric for a sphere of radius a is (a²/(x² + y² + a²)) (dx² + dy² + dz²) or something like that. Wait no, maybe that's for a different coordinate system.

Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, but perhaps this is in a two-dimensional space. Let me think. The given metric is for 2D because it's only dx and dy. So perhaps it's a surface of revolution or something else.

Wait, wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that's like 4 - (x² + y²). So when x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive, right? Because 4 is a positive number. So the metric will be real when x² + y² < 4. But wait, if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which makes ds² blow up. So the radius of curvature must be related to 4 somehow.

Wait, the problem asks about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere usually refers to something with negative curvature. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions.

Wait, let me recall. A pseudosphere (or tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric can be written in terms of a parameter, maybe like r being the radius. But I'm not sure how that ties into the given metric.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is that of a hyperbolic plane or something similar. The hyperbolic plane has a metric of the form (dr² + dz²)/ (1 - r²/a²), something like that. Wait, but here we have a similar denominator structure.

Wait, let me write down the given metric again: ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). So this can be rewritten as ds² = (32 dx² + 32 dy²) / (4 - (x² + y²)).

Hmm. Maybe this is a conformally flat metric, because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²), which is the Euclidean metric. So the conformal factor here is 32 / (4 - x² - y²).

Wait, if I think of this as a 2-dimensional space, the Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. The formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates (since the metric is conformally flat) is K = - (1/(2r²)) * ∂²(ln f)/∂x² - (1/(2r²)) * ∂²(ln f)/∂y², where f is the conformal factor.

But wait, maybe I should use the general formula for Gaussian curvature for a metric in conformal form, which is:

K = - (1/(2f)) * [ (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) ) ]

Wait, I think the formula is K = - (1/(2f)) [ (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) ) ].

Because for a metric ds² = f(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by that expression.

So let's compute that. Our f is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Compute ∂f/∂x: let's see. Let me denote the denominator as D = 4 - x² - y². So f = 32/D.

df/dx = (32) * d/dx (D^{-1}) ) = 32 * (-1) * D^{-2} * (-2x) ) = 32 * (2x) / D^2 = 64x / D².

Similarly, df/dy = 64 y / D².

Now, compute the second derivatives.

d²f/dx²: take derivative of 64x / D².

Let me compute it step by step.

Let me denote D = 4 - x² - y².

So, D² = (4 - x² - y²)^2.

df/dx = 64x / D².

d²f/dx² = [64 * D² - 64x * 2 D (dD/dx) ] / D^4.

Wait, using the quotient rule: (d/dx)(numerator/denominator) = (num’ * denominator - num * denom’) / denominator².

So, numerator is 64x, denominator is D².

d²f/dx² = [64 * D² - 64x * (2 D (-2x) ) ] / D^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is D squared, so the derivative of denominator is 2 D * dD/dx.

Wait, more precisely:

d²f/dx² = [ (64) * D² - (64x) * (2D * (-2x)) ) ] / (D^4)

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

First term: derivative of 64x is 64. Multiply by denominator D² → 64 D².

Second term: 64x times derivative of denominator (D²). The derivative of D² is 2D * dD/dx. dD/dx is derivative of (4 -x² -y²) with respect to x → -2x.

So 2D*(-2x) = -4x D.

So the second term is 64x * (-4x D) → -256 x² D.

Thus, numerator of d²f/dx² is 64 D² - (-256 x² D) → 64 D² + 256 x² D.

Wait, no. Wait, the second term in the quotient rule is subtracted. So the formula is [ (num’)(denom) - (num)(denom’) ] / denom².

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recompute the derivative.

d²f/dx² = [ (64) * (D²) - (64x) * (2 D * (-2x)) ) ] / (D^4).

Wait, let's see:

d/dx [64x / D^2 ] = [64 * D² - 64x * (d/dx D²) ] / D^4.

d/dx D² = 2 D * dD/dx.

dD/dx = -2x.

So d/dx D² = 2 D * (-2x) ) = -4x D.

So,

d²f/dx² = [64 D² - 64x*(-4x D) ] / D^4

= [64 D² + 256 x² D ] / D^4

Factor out 64 D:

= [64 D (D + 4 x²) ] / D^4

Simplify:

= 64 (D + 4 x²) / D^3

But wait, D is (4 -x² - y²), which is 4 - (x² + y²). Let me substitute that.

So,

= 64 [ (4 - (x² + y²)) + 4 x² ] / [ (4 - x² - y²)^3 ]

Simplify numerator: 4 - x² - y² +4x² = 4 + 3x² - y².

So,

d²f/dx² = [64 (4 + 3x² - y²)] / (4 - x² - y²)^3.

Similarly, d²f/dy² would be the same process.

Wait, let me compute d²f/dy².

df/dy = 64 y / D².

d²f/dy² = [ (64 D²) - (64 y) (2 D * (-2y) ) ] / D^4.

Which is [64 D² + 256 y² D ] / D^4.

Factor: 64 D (D +4 y²) / D^4 → 64 (D +4 y² ) / D^3.

Again, substituting D =4 -x² - y².

Numerator becomes 4 -x² - y² +4 y² =4 -x² +3 y².

So,

d²f/dy² = [64 (4 - x² +3 y² ) ] / (4 -x² - y²)^3.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is,

K = - (1/(2f)) [ d²f/dx² + d²f/dy² ].

f is 32 / D.

So,

K = - (1/(2*(32/D))) [ (64 (4+3x² - y²) ) / D^3 + (64 (4 - x² +3 y² )) / D^3 ]

Wait, let me factor this out.

Compute the sum inside the brackets:

Sum = [64 (4 +3x² - y²) + 64 (4 -x² +3 y² ) ] / D^3

Factor out 64:

= 64 [ (4+3x² - y²) + (4 -x² +3 y²) ] / D^3

Simplify inside the brackets:

4 +4 =8

3x² -x² =2x²

- y² +3 y² =2 y²

So,

Sum = 64 (8 + 2x² + 2 y² ) / D^3

Factor 2:

= 64 * 2 (4 +x² + y²) ) / D^3 → 128 (4 + x² + y²) / D^3.

So,

Sum = 128 (4 +x² + y² ) / D^3.

So now,

K = - ( 1/(2*(32/D)) ) * (128 (4 +x² + y² ) / D^3 )

Simplify denominator: 2*32=64.

So,

K = - ( D/(64) ) * (128 (4 +x² + y² ) ) / D^3 )

Simplify terms:

128 /64= 2.

So,

K = - ( 2 (4 +x² + y² ) ) / D^3.

But D is (4 -x² - y²), so,

K = - 2 (4 +x² + y² ) / ( (4 -x² - y²)^3 )

Hmm, but wait, this expression for K seems to depend on x and y, which would mean the curvature isn't constant. But that can't be right for a pseudosphere, which has constant curvature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric is in the form of a sphere but scaled, so maybe it's a sphere with a certain radius.

Wait, the standard metric for a sphere of radius a is (a²)/(x² + y² + a²) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but that's in 3D. Alternatively, in 2D, the metric for a sphere of radius a is (a²/(x² + y² + a²)) (dx² + dy²) if we're using polar coordinates or something else.

Hmm, but given that, the denominator in the metric is (4 -x² -y²), which would be similar but with a negative sign. So perhaps it's a hyperbolic space?

Wait, for a hyperbolic space, the metric can be written as (dr² + dz² )/(1 - (r²/a²)), but that's in Poincaré coordinates or something.

Alternatively, the metric could be for a sphere of radius a when x² + y² < a². But in our case, the denominator is 4 -x² - y². So perhaps a is 2, because 4 is 2 squared.

So if this metric is for a sphere of radius 2, then why is it called a pseudosphere? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the metric is for a space with negative curvature, making it a pseudosphere.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given metric is a conformally flat metric with a certain curvature. Let me think about the form.

Wait, perhaps the area element can help. The area of the pseudosphere is given, but in the options, some are functions of x and y, but others are constants or infinities.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, and I need to compute its area.

Wait, the area (surface area) of a pseudosphere is known. Wait, I think the pseudosphere has infinite area. Because it's a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a complete surface, so its area should be infinite. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given metric, the area can be computed by integrating the area element over the entire space.

The area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, g = (32/(4 -x² - y²))².

Wait, no: the metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so in matrix form, it's diag( a, a ), where a = 32/(4 -x² - y²). So determinant is a².

Thus, dA = a dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the domain of integration is where 4 -x² -y² >0 → x² + y² <4.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, this looks like a tricky integral. Let me switch to polar coordinates, since x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So,

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Compute the integral:

= 32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So,

Integral becomes:

= 32 * 2π ∫ (u=4 to 0) [1/u] * (-du/2 )

= 32 *2π * (1/2) ∫ (0 to4 ) (1/u) du

= 32 * π [ ln(u) ] from 0 to 4.

Wait, ln(u) from 0 to 4: ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh no, that suggests the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

Hmm, so the area would be infinity. But let me check the limits. The substitution: When r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the integral from 0 to4 of 1/u du is ln(4) - ln(0^+), which is ln(4) - (-infty) → infty. So the area integral diverges; the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius 2. So if I'm getting infinite area, that would correspond to option D) which is +infty.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Is a pseudosphere really an infinite area? I thought the pseudosphere is a finite surface, but perhaps it's the tractricoid which is a finite area. Wait, no, wait: the tractricoid is the pseudosphere, and it's a surface of infinite extent but finite area? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The tractricoid (pseudosphere) is a surface of revolution of the tractrix. It's a finite surface in the sense that it's a surface of revolution, so it's a compact surface? Or is it non-compact?

Wait, I think the tractrix has asymptotic lines, and when you rotate it, the surface extends infinitely in the z-direction. So the pseudosphere is non-compact, but does it have a finite area?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Maybe the metric given doesn't represent the usual pseudosphere. Because the given metric seems to have a denominator that approaches zero at r=2, leading to an infinite area.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0

B)4 pi (x² + y² )

C)4 pi (x² - y² )

D) +infty

So, from the integral, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but in the question, the pseudosphere has radius r=2. So if the metric given is that of the pseudosphere of radius 2, then the area should be finite or infinite?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the metric. The metric is ds² = 32/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 -r², where r is the radial coordinate in 2D. So when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, leading to infinite curvature. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a 2D surface, so its area would be the integral of the area element, which we found to be infinite. So the area is infinite, so the answer is D.

So looking at the options, option D is +infty, which is correct.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests that the metric is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), and it diverges as \(x^2 + y^2 \to 4\). This indicates a singularity at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), which corresponds to the boundary of the domain.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element \(dA\) associated with the metric. For a conformally flat metric \(ds^2 = f(dx^2 + dy^2)\), the area element is given by:

\[
dA = f \, dx \, dy.
\]

Here, \(f = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\). When \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{-du}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln(u) \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the area is infinite. This result is consistent with the fact that the pseudosphere, as described by this metric, has infinite area due to the diverging curvature at the boundary \(r = 2\).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
