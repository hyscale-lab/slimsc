Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. Oh right, I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. So when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer, their relative speed isn't just u - v. Instead, you use the formula (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, wait. Wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So relative speed is about 0.14c.

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that leaves me with those two. 

Next, the total energy of the system. Oh right, total energy in relativity is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies, but wait, no, more accurately, each astronaut's total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy.

So for each, I need to compute gamma and multiply by their respective masses.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36.

Gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * m * c² * 2m? Wait, no. Wait, each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest energy. So rest energy is mc², but their rest mass is 2m and 3m. So first astronaut's energy is gamma_1 * (2m)c². Second is gamma_2 * (3m)c².

Wait, let me compute each gamma.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c → v²/c² = 0.36 → 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 → sqrt(0.64)=0.8 → gamma = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Second astronaut: v=0.5c → v²/c²=0.25 → 1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660 → gamma ≈ 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547.

So their energies:

First: 1.25 * (2m) c² = 2.5 m c².

Second: 1.1547 * (3m) c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait wait, 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.464? Let me calculate that: 1.1547 *3 = 3.4641.

So total energy is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which would be if we just added wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.1547 is approximately 1/(sqrt(3)/2) )? Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866, so 1/0.866 ≈1.1547.

So 1.1547 *3 is indeed approximately 3.464.

So summing, 2.5 +3.464 is 5.964, which is roughly 5.96 mc².

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option is C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: same v_rel but E=5 mc^2, which is 5, which is less than what I calculated.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at velocities \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

#### First Astronaut (\( m = 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\( m = 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
