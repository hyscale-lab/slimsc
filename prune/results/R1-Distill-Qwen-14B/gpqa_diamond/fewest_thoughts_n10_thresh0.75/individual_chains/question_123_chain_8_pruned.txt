Okay, so I've got a physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, things get a bit tricky. But wait, the question says both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, so maybe I don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that. 

The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That's a pretty high speedâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me calculate that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 divided by 3e5 is 0.2, which is 20% the speed of light. Hmm, okay, relativistic effects might be important here, but maybe the problem expects a classical approach, given the options are in the millions of kilometers.

Wait, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so we have time in one frame and need to find distance in another. That sounds like a problem involving time dilation or length contraction, but again, I'm not sure if relativistic effects are required here. Because the speed is 20% of c, which is non-negligible, but perhaps they're simplifying it.

Let me think. If we're in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s, right? Because in the absence of acceleration or other forces, the relative speed should be the same in both frames. Wait, wait, but if the frames are moving relative to each other, the velocities would add up according to special relativity. But here, the problem states that both are inertial, so perhaps I can just use the classical velocity addition? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, the problem says in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,
