Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So, (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. That means four degrees of unsaturation. That could be one benzene ring (which counts as 3 DoU) and one double bond (1 DoU), or another ring or double bond. But since both are aromatic compounds, they must have the benzene ring, so 3 DoU, so the remaining one must be something else, like a methyl group attached in a way that doesn't add more unsaturation, but wait, methyl groups themselves don't contribute. Oh, wait, maybe it's another ring? Or perhaps the substituents have something else. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So, for each substituent, like a methyl group, which is C1H3. Let's see, if each substituent is a methyl, then:

Benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups would be C6 +4C = C10, and H: 6 - 4*3 +4*1? Wait, no, wait. Each methyl group is three H's. Hmmm. Maybe I should think about the substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula C10H14: Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents must account for C4H8. So,
