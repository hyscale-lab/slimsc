Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me think through what I know.

So, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the formation constant, K, is related to the stability of the complex ion. A higher K means the complex is more stable. But how does that tie into the concentration of the calcium ions?

Wait, right. When you have a complex ion like Ca-EDTA, the dissociation can be considered. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have an equilibrium constant that's the reciprocal of K, right?

So the formation reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this formation is 5e10. So the dissociation would be CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-, and K_dissociation would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, we have the complex already, so we're looking at the reverse reaction. So the concentration of free calcium ions would be based on the dissociation equilibrium.

We can model this with the equation. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, some of this will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let the change be x. So:

At initial:
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

At change:
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:

K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2−] = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 2e-11.

Since K is very small (2e-11 is tiny), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the equation to x² / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So, x² ≈ 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

Wait, but why is the concentration so low? Because the formation constant is very large,
