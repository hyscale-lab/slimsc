Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So in this case, Ca²+ is binding with EDTA to form the Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem says it's a 1:1 complex, so the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the key here is to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. Formation constants are for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. The general equation would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) )

But wait, EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form, right? Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe I don't have to worry about the different species of EDTA. So I can assume that EDTA is present as the Y^4- ion.

In the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. But the problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, but the total EDTA comes from the complex and any free EDTA. But if the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA is in excess or not? Hmm, I think in this scenario, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we're assuming that the EDTA is in excess,
