Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm. Let me read it again and try to think step by step.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. The sphere has radius R.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence theorem relates volume integrals of divergence to surface integrals of the vector field. Oh right! The divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So maybe I can use that instead of computing the volume integral directly.

But first, let me think about the divergence of f. The field is purely radial, so in spherical coordinates, the divergence might be easier to compute. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only a radial component (F_r) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). Because the other components (like theta and phi) are zero.

So for this field, F = F_r e_r, and F_r is 1/r². Let me plug that into the divergence formula.

Divergence ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's compute that. r² multiplied by 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero? That would mean the volume integral of the divergence is zero. But wait, am I sure about that?

Wait, no. Because when F_r is 1/r², then the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So it seems like the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. But because the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere except at r=0, the volume integral would be zero. But wait, that can't be right because if I use the divergence theorem, the surface integral would be something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So for any region that doesn't include the origin, the integral would be zero. But if the sphere includes the origin, maybe the divergence isn't defined there, but the integral might still have a value.

Wait, no. The divergence theorem is applicable when the vector field is smooth within the volume. If there's a point charge or something at the origin, like in the case of an electric field, then the divergence isn't zero, but the flux through the Gaussian surface is non-zero. So maybe the divergence is not zero, but I made a mistake in calculating it.

Wait, let me re-examine the vector field. The field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So F = (1/r²) e_r.

Computing the divergence again: ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r ). Since F_r = 1/r², r² F_r = 1. The derivative of 1 is zero, so ∇·F = 0. Hmm, so in all space except at r=0, the divergence is zero. But wait, at r=
