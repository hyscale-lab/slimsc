Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

First, let's figure out what's happening at 25% titration. And then the equivalence point.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should calculate the initial concentrations after dilution.

Okay, so initial concentrations:

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So diluted to 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/dm³, and 20 cm³ is 0.02 dm³. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then total volume is 40 cm³ = 0.04 dm³. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 mol/dm³. Yep, that's correct. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from earlier). So to reach equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is same as acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 dm³, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume.

25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, wait, no. Because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would be when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, no, another way: 25% of the equivalence volume is when 25% of the required NaOH has been added, which would mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So yes, that's correct.

So at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions.

So the first part is to calculate the pH at 25% titration.

For the 25% point, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), where [A^-]
