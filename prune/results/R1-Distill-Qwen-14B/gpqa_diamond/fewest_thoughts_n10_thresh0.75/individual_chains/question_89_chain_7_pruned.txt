Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism, to form an alkene. So, heating dihalide with KOH should give an alkene—specifically, an adamantene with a double bond.

The product after this reaction is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR spectrum shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests maybe an -OH group or something deshielded. Wait, but wait, after elimination, we get an alkene. But the IR spectrum has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), like a ketone or an ester. Hmm, that's confusing because elimination usually gives an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Oh! Wait, when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, especially when heated, sometimes a different reaction can happen. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Oh wait, no. Wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons that are two apart? Or maybe on adjacent carbons in a chair-like structure. But when you eliminate two bromides, you form a double bond.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer or a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with KOH, which is a base, more likely elimination. Wait, could it
