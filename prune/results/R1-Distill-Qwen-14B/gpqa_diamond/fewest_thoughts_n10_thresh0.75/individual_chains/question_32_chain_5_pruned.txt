Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when this nucleus is moving at 0.96c. I remember that for relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy formulas. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc².

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma first.

So, v = 0.96c. Plugging into gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me compute that. (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/(0.28) ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have messed up the square root. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 = 0.0784, yes. So sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714... Maybe more accurately, 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.57142857.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I need its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus. I'm a bit unsure about the exact value for Li-6. Let me think; I remember that for a nucleus, the mass can be approximated using the sum of protons and neutrons, but wait, actually, the exact mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass, but maybe for simplicity, I can look up the approximate mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, I might remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c² each. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, that's 6 nucleons. So 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.6
