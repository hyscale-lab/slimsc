Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. Dark spots on a star would make it appear cooler, so the effective temperature would go down. But wait, the effective temperature is an average measure, right? So the spots must be emitting less, making the overall average temperature lower.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, level i and level j, is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem tells us that the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So that's the emission or absorption line we're considering.

Now, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, so does that mean that the temperature in the photosphere is changing? Or perhaps, the effective temperature is the average, but the actual conditions where the line forms might change. Or maybe the entire photosphere is cooling, but that doesn't seem right because spots are localized. Hmm, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so I think we can take that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere (on average) is now 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So each spot is presumably cooler than 6000 K, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but the
