Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the para-isomer yield in different benzene derivatives when they react with excess bromine. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.

So, the substances are numbered 1 to 6. Each is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, when a benzene ring has a substituent, it can activate or deactivate the ring and direct electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions. For electrophilic substitution, activating groups like -OH, -OCH3, -NH2, and alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups, especially strong ones like nitro, -COOH, -COOR, -COR, and halogens (but I think halogens are weak deactivating and ortho/para directors), direct meta.

So, for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para or meta director.

Let's list each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So the incoming bromine would add to para or ortho positions. Wait, but in electrophilic substitution, the substituent directs where the new substituent goes. So, for a benzene with CH3, the substituent is activating, so the ring is more reactive, and the new electrophile (Br+) would attack para or ortho.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like NO2 or COOH, then the ring is less reactive, and the substitution occurs at meta positions relative to the existing group.

So, the para-isomer's yield depends on whether the substituent is a meta or ortho/para director. For meta directors, the substituent will direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, so the para-isomer may not be the major product. Wait, no, wait. The substituent
