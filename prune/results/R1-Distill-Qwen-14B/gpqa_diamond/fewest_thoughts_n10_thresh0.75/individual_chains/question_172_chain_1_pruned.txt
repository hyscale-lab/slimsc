Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on stellar atmospheres, but let's think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh right, when atoms are more excited, they have higher energy states. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the problem states that both photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means each region is at a uniform temperature, and the distribution of atomic energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. 

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature. The formula I remember is something like n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i is the number of atoms in state i, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the excitation is the ratio of n (number of atoms) in two states. The energy difference is given, and the ratio of excitation is 2:1. So for star 1, n1/n2 is 2, where n1 is the excited state and n2 is the lower state maybe.

Wait, but wait, actually the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So in star_1, the number of atoms in the higher energy level is double that in star_2 for the same level. Or is it the ratio of the two stars? Maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the statement is that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So if the energy levels are E, then for star_1, n1 is twice as much as n2 (but wait, n2 here would refer to star_2's same energy level).

Let me think. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for a particular transition, the ratio between two energy levels i and j (let's say j is the lower level) is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is E_i
