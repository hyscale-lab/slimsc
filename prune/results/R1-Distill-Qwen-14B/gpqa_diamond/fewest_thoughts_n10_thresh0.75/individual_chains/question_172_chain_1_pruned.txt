Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) equals exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, but here, the energy difference is given as positive, so E2 - E1 is ΔE.

In this problem, the excited state is higher in star_1. Let me think. Let's denote star_1 as having temperature T1 and star_2 as T2. The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Wait no, the question says that the excitation is twice as much. So for each star, the ratio of upper to lower states is n_upper / n_lower. So for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

So setting up the equation: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, wait, no. Because if star_1 has twice the excitation, then that ratio is higher. Let me think again. The ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for star_1, that ratio is higher than for star_2, because the excitation
