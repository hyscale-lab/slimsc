Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

Astronomers are observing a star similar in radius to the Sun. Half of one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, so that means the spots take up 20% of the hemisphere's surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The star is rotating, causing these spots to come into and out of view, which affects its brightness over time. The situation mimics the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming no spots were present?

The options are A to D. I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) during a transit is approximately (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So, if I can find ΔF, I can find Rpl/Rstar.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation. Let me think about how that works. When a spot is on the side of the star facing us, and the star rotates so that the spot moves into our view, the observed brightness changes. Since the spots are cooler, when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer than when they're not visible. So, the brightness variation is due to the spots being in or out of view as the star rotates.

The problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet. Therefore, I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by a planet, then solve for the planet's radius.

But wait, the star isn't completely covered by spots. The filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area blocked by spots when facing us isn't the entire hemisphere but just 20% of it.

Wait, the star is symmetric? Or is the hemisphere the same as the area visible? Let me clarify. When the star rotates, we see one hemisphere at a time. If 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots, then each spot covers a certain area.

Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But in this case, it's one hemisphere that's covered with a 20% filling factor. So, the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. But since the star is a sphere, a hemisphere is half the surface area of the star.

Wait, no. The star's surface area is
