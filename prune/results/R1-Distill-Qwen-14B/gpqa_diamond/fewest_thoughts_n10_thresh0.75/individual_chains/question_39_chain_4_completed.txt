Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question says.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Since the particle isn't found outside 1 and 3, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That looks a bit odd. Wait, the wave function usually is a complex function, but in this case, it's given as a sum of real and imaginary parts. Let me write it out:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - (0.5)i

But wait, wait. Wait, I think I should consider ψ(x) as a complex function where the real part is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the imaginary part shouldn't be a constant. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the expression. Let me read again.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5*i. Oh, so it's a complex number with real part (a / sqrt(1 +x)) and imaginary part -0.5. But wait, the wave function should depend on x, right? Because the particle's position varies with x. So having the imaginary part as a constant (-0.5i) seems odd because that would make the imaginary part the same for all x. That's probably not right. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but the way it's written isn't clear. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function has two terms, but the question says that each particle is in a part of space where it can exist, implying that it's a valid solution.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). But the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that would be ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. Hmm.

Wait, but the wave function's modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So for each x, the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

But for a valid wave function, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1, since the total probability is 1.

Wait, but in the expression given, the imaginary part is a constant (-0.5i), so the square of the imaginary part is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So when I square the modulus, it's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So integrating this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Let's write that equation.

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but let's compute this integral. Let me split it into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx and the integral of 0.25 dx.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2), because ln(4)=2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So adding those two parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Computing that, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that.

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Let me calculate: sqrt(0.72) is approximately 0.8485. So a ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation; let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, I think I messed up the integral. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So from x=1 to x=3, 1+x goes from 2 to4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So yes, the integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(2).

Then the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931).

Compute 0.5 / 0.6931: approximately 0.7213.

sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function's imaginary part is a constant, which is unusual. Typically, the wave function's real and imaginary parts vary with x. But the problem states that this is the wave function in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3). So perhaps the wave function is normalized in this interval.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the wave function includes the imaginary part as a constant. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) -i * 0.5.

Wait, but in that case, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I compute |ψ|², it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral of |ψ|² from 1 to 3 is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ 0.849.

Which is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must integrate to 1 over this interval:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **Integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Integral of \( 0.25 \):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
