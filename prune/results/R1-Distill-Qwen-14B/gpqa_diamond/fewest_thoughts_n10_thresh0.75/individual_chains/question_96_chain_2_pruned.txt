Okay, so I have this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data are the distance to the galaxy, d = 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size of the event horizon, θ = 10^-17 degrees. The options are all powers of ten, so I just need to figure out which exponent is right.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right! The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, maybe it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G)? I think the exact formula might vary, but the area is proportional to entropy. So the key is to find the area A of the event horizon.

The event horizon is a sphere, so the area A = 4π r², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, how do I find r? I think the Schwarzschild radius r_s is given by 2GM/c². But maybe I can find r directly using the angular size and the distance.

Oh, right! The angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance. So θ ≈ r / d. So r = θ * d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

Let me do the unit conversion. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees). Let me calculate that. 10^-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians (since π ≈3.1416, so 3.1416/(180) ≈ 0.01745). So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. But I need to convert parsecs into meters because I'll be using SI units for area and other constants. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So r ≈ θ * d = (1.745e-19 rad) * (3.0857e26 m). Let me compute that. 1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.745 * 3.0857) * 1e7. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, but actually 1.745 *3.0857 ≈ 1.745 *3 =5.235, but let's be precise
