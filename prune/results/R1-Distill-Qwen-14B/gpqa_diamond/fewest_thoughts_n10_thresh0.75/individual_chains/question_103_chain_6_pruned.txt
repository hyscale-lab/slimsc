Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, so I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is on the ethanone part, which is connected to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts where? Let's see, the ketone is attached to the benzene in position 1. So the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So that's meta to each other, but wait, if the ketone is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are both meta to it, but are they adjacent? Hmm, maybe I should think of the benzene ring as having substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment for the ketone.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (ethan-1-one) group, a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, and then at the meta positions relative to that, a bromine and a nitro group. Wait, but wait the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring. So if the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. So how are they arranged? Let me imagine the benzene ring: position 1 is where the ketone is attached. Then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go
