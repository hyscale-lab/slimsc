Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

First, I remember that any angular momentum operator, like P here, can be represented in terms of its components. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's made up of Px, Py, and Pz components.

The problem gives me the matrices for each component:

- Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but I think these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2, I suppose. So the operator P must be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector.

Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, that means the direction is given by some angle θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in x-z. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is the one where the angle φ is zero or π, because that's where y is zero. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along direction n is P · n. So that would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is in x-z, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So P_n = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Wait, but in the given, the operator components are each scaled by ħ/
