Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem is about a muon, which is like a heavier version of an electron, but I think the specifics of the particle might not matter too much here. The operator in question is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = λ|ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So here, λ is +ħ/2.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

Let me write down each component as I understand them:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so each component is a Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P is (ħ/2) times each of these. So, the operator P in the x-z plane... but wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh, probably because the problem says the vector is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator must be the component along that direction.

Wait, no, the operator is given as P, which is in components. But if we're looking for the eigenvector of the operator along n, then we have to construct the operator along n and then find its eigenvector. Oh, right, that makes sense.

So, the operator along the direction n is given by the vector product of the components. So, if n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, say making
