Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The setup is that there's a charge q moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a later time when t is greater than the time tr, which is when the field was generated. 

Wait, so the charge is moving, and we're considering the electromagnetic fields at a later time. I remember that electromagnetic fields have retarded potentials. Retarded because the effect is seen later than the cause. So the potentials depend on the position of the charge at an earlier time, because the influence can't travel faster than the speed of light.

The problem gives me a vector d, which is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So if I imagine, at time tr, the charge was at some position, and now we're looking at a point r, which is a distance d away from where the charge was at tr.

The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. So that's important because moving charges can create magnetic fields, which are related to the vector potential.

I remember the general expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential V is usually due to the charge itself, and the vector potential A comes from the motion of the charge. Both are calculated considering the retarded time.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Because the effects are retarded, the distance isn't just the current distance, but the distance at the retarded time.

The vector potential A is given by something involving the velocity of the charge. The formula I think is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r), or something like that, but it's not exactly that because it depends on the direction and other factors.

Wait, but in the options, the expressions involve terms like dc minus the dot product of d and v. Let me think about that. The denominator in the options C and D has terms like (d
