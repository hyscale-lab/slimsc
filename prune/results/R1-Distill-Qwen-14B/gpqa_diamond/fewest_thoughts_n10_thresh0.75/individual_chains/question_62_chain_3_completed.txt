Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me visualize the target molecule. It looks like it has two cyclohexane rings. One of them is attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and the other is a carbaldehyde. Wait, so the structure is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl-cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, right, the substituents are on the cyclohexane ring.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a C≡CH group attached.

I need to figure out the reagents used in each step to get to the target. Let's look at the options provided (A to D) and see what each step does.

First, I'll think about the possible reactions. Maybe I need to functionalize the triple bond. Triple bonds can undergo various additions. For instance, they can be hydrogenated, or they can be used in alkyne chemistry reactions like hydration, oxidation, or maybe even some kind of addition to form rings.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. Oh, how do we get an aldehyde from a triple bond? Well, one way is through the hydration of an alkyne to form a ketone, but that's not directly an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe we can do something else. Oh wait, another thought: maybe using a hydrolysis reaction to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach. Ethynylcyclohexane could be converted into a cyclohexenone via some method, but not sure if that's the right path.

Let me think about the steps. Let's imagine the reaction steps:

Step 1: Maybe deprotonate something. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, like in dehydrohalogenation or for forming enolates. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Oh, perhaps step 1 is about alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is going to be converted into an aldehyde. So, from C≡CH to CHO. How do you do that? One way is through the Stephen reduction or maybe via oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first hydrogenated. Wait, if you hydrogenate a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it becomes a single bond, CH2CH2, but that would just be ethylcyclohexane, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe partial hydrogenation to a double bond?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. Let's see, the triple bond could be converted into a ketone or aldehyde via hydration or oxidation.

Wait, another approach is using the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz reaction, but that might be more advanced. Alternatively, think about ozonolysis which cleaves triple bonds. Ozonolysis of alkynes gives diketones or maybe other products, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. Let's look at the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is part of a larger system. Let me think about possible steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via a hydroboration or some other method. Or perhaps we need to form an epoxide or another functional group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options given and see which sequence makes sense.

Option A: Steps 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride; step 2: H2/Pd; step 3: Ba(OH)2; step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Step 1: Using NaNH2 (a strong base) with methyl chloride probably leads to alkylation. But wait, where would the methyl group go? If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which has a triple bond. So maybe the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, making it a strong base. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it? Hmm, perhaps introducing a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a sp-hybridized carbon at the end. Deprotonating that with a strong base like NaNH2 would give a strong base, maybe an acetylide. Then adding methyl chloride could be an alkylation. So perhaps we get (cyclohexyl)(methyl)acetylide?

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe step 1 is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a larger alkyne.

Wait, but then step 2 is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond. So, if the alkyne was ethynylcyclohexane, after alkylation, it would be maybe propargylcyclohexane or something similar, then hydrogenation would give ethylcyclohexane? Not sure if that's useful.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming a Grignard reagent, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent, not a Grignard reagent.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each reagent's function.

Option B: Steps 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; step 2: Li in liquid NH3; step 3: O3 and H2O; step 4: NH4OH.

NaNH2 would deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form an acetylide. Then ethyl chloride would alkylate it, adding an ethyl group. So after step 1, perhaps we have ethyl-ethynylcyclohexane or something similar?

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a condition for Birch reduction? Or for deprotonation to form a strong base. Or maybe it's for elimination or alkyne reactions.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent, sometimes used for dehalogenation or for reductions. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of alkenes from alkynes (like for deprotonating and then elimination, perhaps forming a trans-alkene? Or maybe for the formation of carbides? Not sure.

Then step 3 is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, producing carbonyl groups. So if step 2 forms a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a workup for ozonolysis, perhaps hydrolyzing to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group.

Option C: Steps 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride; step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; step3: O3, (CH3)2S; step4: Ba(OH)2.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride likely alkylation of the acetylide, adding a methyl group. Step 2: H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, after step 1, perhaps the alkyne is longer, say, methyl added, then hydrogenation would make a single bond. So, maybe we get a longer chain.

Step 3: Ozone in the presence of (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis would break double bonds into carbonyls. But if step 2 is hydrogenation, perhaps a double bond forms here? Wait, H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds, not double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to cis or trans-alkene? Wait, no. H2 and Pd typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds (alkanes) if excess H2 is used, or to cis alkenes if partial hydrogenation is done, but it depends on the conditions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has two cyclohexane rings connected by a CH2OH group and a CHO group. Wait, no: the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a hydroxymethyl group, which itself is attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring (ring A) attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is connected to another cyclohexane (ring B). Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the synthesis steps. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (which is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group).

Let me think about the target. Looking at the structure, perhaps it's formed by adding groups to the cyclohexane ring. The aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group are substituents.

So, perhaps the process involves:

1. Adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.
2. Hydrogenating the triple bond to form a single bond.
3. Oxidizing to form a ketone or aldehyde.
4. Doing some kind of ring-opening or addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a ring. Wait, another approach: The triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group. How? For example, through hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone, and then further oxidation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. Hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. So, if I add water to the triple bond, I get a cyclohexanone group. Wait, but that would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde if it's a primary position, but ethynyl is at a position that's perhaps in a way that hydration would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, no, because ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is directly attached to the cyclohexane: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Hydration of an alkyne can be done under acidic conditions. For example, H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which are used in the oxymercuration reaction). Oxymercuration hydration of an alkyne would give a ketone. So, if I have cyclohexane-C≡CH, after hydration, it becomes cyclohexane-C(OH)CH3, which would be a ketone, cyclohexanecarbonyl group.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps we need to do something else.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, but in a way that gives an aldehyde instead of a ketone. That would require a different condition. Wait, oxidation of an alkyne can lead to a diketone, but that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process. First, partial hydrogenation to a trans-alkene, then oxidation of the alkene to a diol, then further oxidation to a carbonyl. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via alkylation of the alkyne. So, using a base like NaNH2, which deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, then treat with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes methyl-ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps as (cyclohexyl)ethynyl methyl.

Then, step 2 might be hydrogenation of the triple bond. If hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the product would be (cyclohexyl)ethyl methyl? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is partial, giving an alkene. Pd and H2 can control the degree of hydrogenation based on conditions. If it's a Lindlar catalyst, you get cis addition, but with regular Pd, you get full hydrogenation. So, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond.

But then, step 3 in option C is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the alkene is between two cyclohexane rings, then ozonolysis would form two aldehyde groups. But the target has only one aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target again. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl substituent. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent, then forming the aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a hydroxymethyl group through some steps. For example, adding a hydroxyl group via oxidation. Let's think: the triple bond could be converted to a carbonyl, then further to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → something → then add substituents.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D: Steps 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li in liquid NH3; 3. O3, (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, methanol is a methylating agent? Or maybe it's for forming an enolate. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Wait, if ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, methanol (CH3OH) could methylate it. So, perhaps adding a methyl group to the acetylide, giving (cyclohexyl)ethyl methyl or something.

But I'm not entirely sure. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination reactions. Could it form an alkene? If the previous step added a methyl group, perhaps elimination would form a double bond. Then step 3: Ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyls. Then step 4: NH4OH as a workup.

Hmm, I'm not seeing the connection to the target. Let's think about each option again.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. So, how can that be formed from ethynylcyclohexane?

One method is to oxidize the ethynyl group to a carbonyl. But to get an aldehyde from an alkyne, perhaps the alkyne is first converted to a trans-alkene, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but oxidation of alkenes typically gives ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the structure. For an aldehyde, perhaps the starting alkene must be at the end (terminal). So, if ethynylcyclohexane is converted to a terminal alkene, then oxidation would give the aldehyde.

So, the first steps would be to convert the alkyne into a terminal alkene. How? Maybe through hydrogenation. But if you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Lindlar catalyst, you get cis-alkene. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which can then be quenched to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Using ethynylcyclohexane, treat with a strong base to form the acetylide, then quench with a methylating agent to form a longer alkyne. Then hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation to form an alkane, but that doesn't help with the aldehyde.
Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, alternatively, let's think about the target's substituents. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl. So, perhaps that comes from a ring-opening of an epoxide or some kind of cyclopropane formation.

Alternatively, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution or addition occurs, adding a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves the formation of a larger ring or a bridged structure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the problem differently.

The target molecule has two rings. The central part is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (which is connected to another cyclohexyl group) and an aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent and then forming the aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a ketone, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a new carbon-carbon bond, which upon oxidation gives the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation and then oxidation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's look back at the options.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: Alkylation of the acetylide, adding a methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, perhaps making a longer chain.
3. O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which would break any double bonds into carbonyls.
4. Ba(OH)2: Maybe a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or some kind of elimination?

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions or ring openings.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe this is formed via some kind of epoxide ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, which is then subjected to some addition.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to add a methyl group (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl), forming a longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond (maybe giving a longer chain attached to cyclohexane).
3. Ozonolysis to break any new double bonds into carbonyls.
4. Ba(OH)2 for some kind of base-induced reaction.

But I'm not exactly seeing how this leads to the target.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps again. The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps that comes from a previous epoxide formation that is then opened.

Alternatively, perhaps a propargyl alcohol is formed, which is then epoxidized and opened.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then opened to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation with methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes [cyclohexyl]-C≡C-CH2-... Wait, no, maybe it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide, making [cyclohexyl]C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so [cyclohexyl]CH2CH2CH3? Not sure.

Wait, but then step 3: Ozonolysis. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds, but if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond. Unless step 2 somehow leaves a double bond.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene. How? Oh, wait, hydrogenation can be controlled to stop at the alkene. For example, using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's for cis addition, or with a certain pressure and temperature to stop at the alkene.

So, if after step 1, the alkyne is longer, say, [cyclohexyl]C≡C-CH2-..., then hydrogenation would stop at an alkene, making [cyclohexyl]CH2-CH2-CH2-... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 is adding a methyl group to the acetylide, so the alkyne becomes longer, and then hydrogenation stops at the alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkene to form carbonyls. So, if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the target has one aldehyde and another hydroxymethyl group. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination reactions, forming a double bond, or for epoxide ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms a ketone from an ester or ketone, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should consider the correct sequence of reactions to form the target.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. To make a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. So, the alkyne becomes a carbonyl.

How to do that? One way is through hydration. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4, which is the oxymercuration reaction. Oxymercuration typically hydrates an alkyne to form a ketone, but in some conditions, maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Hydration would give CH2-C(OH)CH3, which is a ketone attached to the cyclohexane. But the target has an aldehyde. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched with a methyl group or something else.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted to a trans-alkene, then oxidized to an aldehyde. So, the steps would be:

1. Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.
2. Oxidation of the alkene to an aldehyde.

But how to do that?

Alternatively, using O3 (ozone) on an alkene would break it into carbonyls. So, if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But again, I'm not sure how that fits into the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process.

Wait, another thought: Using the alkyne, perhaps form a propargyl alcohol, then perform an oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl ether, then opened under certain conditions.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about which reagents in the options could lead to the target.

Looking back at the options, let's think about option C again.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, add methyl to acetylide → [cyclohexyl]C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → may hydrogenate the alkyne to alkane. But that would give [cyclohexyl]CH2CH3.

Wait, but then step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but if the alkyne was fully hydrogenated, there's no double bond. So, perhaps step 2 is partial hydrogenation to an alkene.

If step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkene, say, [cyclohexyl]CH2-CH2, but no, it's more likely to be [cyclohexyl]CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Maybe another approach: The correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about each step in option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → forms an alkylated acetylide.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, perhaps adding two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond, so we have a longer chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't seem helpful. Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone would break any double bonds, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, unless a new double bond was formed in step 2.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but does something else. Wait, H2/Pd is a hydrogenation catalyst. If the starting material after step 1 is an alkyne, then step 2 would hydrogenate it to an alkane.

But then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So, unless there's a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Maybe the synthesis involves forming a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a bridge.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used to form a new ring via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → forms the acetylide, then maybe adds a methoxy group or a methyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by an O-methylation, forming an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which reduce aromatic rings, but our starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be used for elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis again, breaking double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup for ozonolysis, perhaps hydrolyzing to carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, maybe the synthesis involves epoxidation and then ring-opening with a nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a carbonyl, then subjected to some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps involve:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation (step 1 in options)
2. Hydrogenation to form an alkene (step 2)
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups (step 3)
4. Something else, like oxidation or reduction.

Hmm. I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should try to evaluate which option makes the most sense.

Looking at the target, the presence of an aldehyde suggests that an alkene must have been oxidatively cleaved. So, one of the steps must involve breaking an alkene into carbonyls.

So, in the options, steps involving ozonolysis (options B, C, D) would do that.

Let's think about option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → maybe adding a methoxy group or methyl group to the acetylide.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination, forming a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, maybe forming aldehydes.

So, if the starting material after step 2 is a compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. But the target has only one aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the double bond is between the two rings, leading to two carbonyls, one of which is an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage forms an aldehyde and another group that becomes the hydroxymethyl group after some steps.

Wait, but then step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous workup for ozonolysis, giving carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl group comes from another reaction.

Another angle: The target has a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps that comes from a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via reduction of a ketone.

Wait, but in that case, a ketone would need to be present, which I don't see in the steps.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here.

Wait, let's think about option C again.

Option C's steps:

Step 1: Alkylation with methyl chloride → adds a methyl to the acetylide, so the alkyne becomes longer.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond. So, the product after step 2 is a cyclohexane with a longer chain, perhaps CH2CH2CH3 or similar.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to form a double bond. So, how would step 3 (ozone) work?

Unless in step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, not a single bond.

Wait, but H2 and Pd typically hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene with a different catalyst, but the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is likely for full hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation gives a longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenation gives a longer alkane.
3. Ozonolysis can't act, so perhaps step 4 is something else.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions or for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it could be used to form a ketone from an alcohol, but that doesn't fit here.

Hmm.

Another thought: The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps forms a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But in the options, I don't see an oxidation step except in option A, which has H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the oxymercuration conditions.

Wait, option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation.
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation.
3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration.

So, step 4 could be converting an alkyne into a carbonyl.

Wait, but after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated. So, step 4 would be after hydrogenation, which would give a single bond. Then, how does step 4 (oxymercuration) fit? Because that's for alkenes or alkynes.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, making (cyclohexyl)propane or something, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not considering all the possibilities.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a structure that suggests a pinacol-like rearrangement or some kind of Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming an epoxide, then opening it with a nucleophile.

Hmm. I'm really not making progress. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think about which option uses the correct reagents for each step.

The target requires the formation of an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

So, one part is forming the aldehyde.

Which options have steps that could form an aldehyde?

Ozonolysis (steps 3 in B, C, D) could form carbonyls, which could be aldehydes if the right structure is present.

So, perhaps in the correct option, after ozonolysis, an aldehyde is formed.

Then, the hydroxymethyl group comes from another step, perhaps a reduction or a substitution.

Wait, looking back, the correct target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed via a Grignard addition.

Hmm, maybe the correct option is D.

Wait, option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms an acetylide, then maybe adding a methoxy group.
2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.
4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis to form aldehydes.

If the ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two aldehyde groups, but the target only has one aldehyde, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, another thought: The target has an aldehyde group and another cyclohexane connected via a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from the ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, but how does that fit into the steps?

In option C, after ozonolysis and workup, perhaps one of the carbonyl groups is a ketone, which is then converted into an alcohol, which upon further reaction becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

But I don't see how that fits into the steps.

I think I need to make a choice now, as I'm going in circles.

Considering that the target has an aldehyde, which is likely formed from the cleavage of a double bond via ozonolysis, I think the correct option is C.

Because option C includes ozonolysis, which can form an aldehyde.

So, the steps would be:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into two carbonyls, one of which is an aldehyde.

4. Ba(OH)2 might form the hydroxymethyl group via some reaction, perhaps elimination or nucleophilic attack.

But I'm not entirely sure, but among the options, option C seems to include the necessary steps.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl substituent. The synthesis involves functionalizing the alkyne group in ethynylcyclohexane to achieve the desired structure. Here's the analysis of the options:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Target Structure**: The molecule has:
   - A cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group (-CHO).
   - A (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

2. **Reagents and Reactions**:
   - **NaNH₂**: A strong base used for deprotonation of alkynes to form acetylides.
   - **Methyl Chloride (CH₃Cl)**: A methylating agent for alkynes.
   - **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenation catalyst for alkynes or alkenes.
   - **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, often used for elimination or nucleophilic substitution.
   - **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.
   - **NH₄OH**: A workup reagent for ozonolysis.

3. **Critical Steps**:
   - Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group or a structure that can lead to the aldehyde.
   - Form the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group via alkylation, hydrogenation, or other reactions.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, Methyl Chloride**: Alkylation of the alkyne to form a methylated acetylide.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, likely forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or substitution.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxymercuration hydration, which typically converts alkenes to ketones or aldehydes.

**Issue**: This sequence does not clearly form the required aldehyde group or the hydroxymethyl substituent. The steps seem disjointed and do not align with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, Ethyl Chloride**: Alkylation of the alkyne to form an ethylated acetylide.
2. **Li in Liquid NH₃**: A strong reducing agent, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis.

**Issue**: While ozonolysis can form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde is formed. The use of ethyl chloride instead of methyl chloride may not align with the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, Methyl Chloride**: Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups, potentially forming an aldehyde.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for forming the hydroxymethyl group via substitution or elimination.

**Strength**: This sequence includes ozonolysis, which can form the aldehyde group, and the use of Ba(OH)₂ may facilitate the formation of the hydroxymethyl group. The steps align reasonably well with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, Methanol**: Deprotonation and potential methylation of the alkyne.
2. **Li in Liquid NH₃**: A strong base for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis.

**Issue**: The use of methanol in step 1 is unclear, and the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is formed. The steps are less aligned with the target structure compared to Option C.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule. The alkylation step adds a methyl group, partial hydrogenation forms an alkene, ozonolysis cleaves the alkene to form carbonyl groups (including an aldehyde), and Ba(OH)₂ facilitates the formation of the hydroxymethyl group.
