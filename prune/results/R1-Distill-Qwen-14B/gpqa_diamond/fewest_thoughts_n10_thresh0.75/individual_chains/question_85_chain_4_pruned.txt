Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but I need to figure out the distance each planet is from the star using the data given.

The problem states that both planets are detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. I've heard that the transit method gives the planet's size (radius) and the distance can be estimated because the depth of the transit depends on the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size. The radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet based on the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum.

Wait, but how do I find the distance from the star for each planet? Oh right, the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) * (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - eÂ²)) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some formulas. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should think about the Doppler shift measurements given for each planet.

The problem says Planet1 induces a
