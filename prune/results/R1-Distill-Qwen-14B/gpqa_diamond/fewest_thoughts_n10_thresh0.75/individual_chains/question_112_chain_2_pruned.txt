Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, which means it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right, when a state is given as proportional, that means it's equal to some constant times the given vector. So I'll have to find the normalization constant by dividing the state by its norm.

Let me write down the state first. Let me represent |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Hmm, to find the normalization factor, I need to calculate the inner product of alpha with itself. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i), because the inner product in the standard basis for spin-1/2 particles is straightforward.

Wait, the inner product is |(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>|^2. So that's (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - (i^2) = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, let me think about what this matrix looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because the spin state is 2-dimensional), the elements are:

A = [
