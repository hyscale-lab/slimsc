Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid model allows for some stretching. But I'm not sure how that affects the photon absorption here. Maybe it's more about the vibrational energy levels?

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So for a diatomic molecule, that would be the ground state. And when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. But what's the next state? For rotation and vibration, transitions can involve either rotational, vibrational, or both changes.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So I need to find the photon's momentum that causes the molecule to move to the next state. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the selection rules determine allowed transitions. For diatomic molecules, the selection rules for rotation are ΔJ = ±1, and for vibration, Δn = ±1. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here since it's a non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So for rotation, the ground state is J=0, and for vibration, n=0 (assuming n starts at 0). So the next possible state
