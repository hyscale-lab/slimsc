Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? Let me try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So, first, I think I should probably normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, not that it's already normalized. Oh wait, right, because when you have a state vector, it's usually a unit vector, but here it's given up to a proportionality constant.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. Let me write down the state: |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. But actually, it's proportional to that, so the actual state would be that divided by its norm. So first, compute the norm squared, which is the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product would be (1+i)(1-i) + (2−i)(2+i). Wait, because when you take the inner product of |up> and |down>, they're orthogonal, so the cross terms would be zero. Oh wait, no—wait, no, in the inner product, the cross terms would involve <up|down> and <down|up>, which are zero. So the total inner product is just |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |a + b i|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So (1+i) has a=1, b=1, so squared modulus is 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

Similarly, |2−i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So that's the normalized state.

Next, the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, okay. So what's this operator look like?

In the z basis (|up>, |down>), the operator matrix would be 2x2. Let's think: For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0 (since i≠j only for i≠j, but when i=j, A_ij is 0). So the matrix is off-diagonal elements as hbar/2, and diagonal zero. So the matrix is:

[ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, so that's a matrix where each off-diagonal element is hbar/2, and the diagonal is zero.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, so A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. The diagonal A_11 and A_22 are zero.

So the operator is A = (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].

Wait a second, that matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix (sigma_x), because sigma_x is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, because A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

Wait, so the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients would be the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can think of this as finding <k|alpha>, where |k> are the eigenstates of A, and then the probability is |<k|alpha>|^2.

So first, I should find the eigenstates of A. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the eigenstates are the superpositions of |up> and |down> with equal coefficients.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same, because A is a multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, wait—actually, the eigenvalues for σ_x are +1 and -1, so for A, which is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), which are ħ/2 and −ħ/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, as above.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the probabilities. Alternatively, I can compute the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate and then square their magnitudes.

So let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

First, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

<+x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So that becomes [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ) + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

But <up|up> is 1, and <down|down> is 1. The cross terms are <up|down> and <down|up>, which are zero.

So this simplifies to [ (1+i + 2−i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )

Simplify the numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = (3) + (0i). So 3.

So <+x| alpha> = 3 / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude, which is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So about 0.643.

Similarly, for |−x>:

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So <−x| alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| − <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Expanding, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> − (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> − (2−i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ] * 1/sqrt(2).

Again, cross terms are zero, so this becomes [ (1+i) − (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, let me do that again.

Wait, the expression is:

(1+i) * 1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) [ from <up|up> ]
plus
(2−i) * (-1)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) [ because it's <down| multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| − <down| ), so the term is (2−i) * (-1) from <down|down>, hence the negative ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Breaking it down:

= [ (1+i) * (1) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) ) ] 
  + [ (2−i) * (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) ) ]
Because the first term comes from <up|up>, and the second from <down|up> (which is zero, but actually, no, no: wait, the expansion is:

<up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2−i)|down> − <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2−i)|down>

But since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero, this reduces to:

(1+i) <up|up> + (2−i)(-1) <down|down>

So it becomes:

(1+i) * 1 + (2−i) * (-1) 

But wait, when you take <−x| alpha>, the expression is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| − <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Which equals (1+i)(1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [from <up|up>] + (2−i)(-1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [from <down|down>].

So the numerator is (1+i) − (2−i) = (1+i) −2 + i = (1−2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So <−x| alpha> = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is |−1 + 2i|^2 / 14.

Compute |−1 + 2i|^2: (−1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So the probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is about 0.643 and 5/14 is about 0.357, which sum to 14/14=1, so that checks out.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Hmm, that's close. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36.

So the first part of the question gives probabilities around 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is finding the average value of the operator A.

The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and σ_x has expectation value <sigma_x> = <+x| sigma_x |alpha> ?

Wait, no, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, we can compute it directly.

Another approach: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that A_ij is 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So A in the z basis is the matrix:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So |alpha> is a column vector with components [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the expectation value is alpha^† A alpha.

Let me compute that.

Let me denote |alpha> as a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

So alpha^† is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, alpha^† A alpha = 

[ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the matrix product A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2−i)/sqrt(7) ),
              ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2−i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, alpha^† times that:

= [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the product is:

= (1−i)(2−i) * (ħ/2) / (7) ) + (2+i)(1+i) * (ħ/2) / (7)

Wait, let me compute each term:

Term 1: (1−i)(2−i) * (ħ/2) /7

(1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= (2-1) -3i
= 1 -3i

Term 2: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2+3i -1 (since i²=-1)
= 1 +3i

So adding Term1 and Term2:

(1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2

So the entire expectation value becomes (2) * (ħ/2) /7 ) 
= (2 * ħ/2 ) /7 = ħ /7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the average is hbar /7.

Option D says 2hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So this would fit.

Option D has other probabilities and average.

So the correct option would be A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( | \alpha \rangle \)
The norm of \( | \alpha \rangle \) is calculated as:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Identify the eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
These are also the eigenstates of \( A \).

### Step 3: Express \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The inner products of \( | \alpha \rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( | \alpha \rangle \), the calculation yields:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
From the above results:
- Probabilities: \( P(+x) \approx 0.64 \), \( P(-x) \approx 0.36 \),
- Average value: \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

These match **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
