This places:\n   - Carboxylic acid at position 1.\n   - Carbaldehyde at position 3.\n   - Cyano at position 5.\n\n3. **Substituents Ortho to the Carboxylic Acid**: Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. These positions are occupied by:\n   - Hydroxyl (-OH) at position 6.\n   - Dimethylamino (-N(CH\u2083)\u2082) at position 2.\n\n4. **Substituent Para to the Carboxylic Acid**: Para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is position 4, which is occupied by the methoxy (-OCH\u2083) group.\n\n5. **Substituent Ortho to the Cyano Group**: The cyano group (-CN) is at position 5. Its ortho positions are 4 and 6. The methoxy (-OCH\u2083) at position 4 and the hydroxyl (-OH) at position 6 are both ortho to the cyano group, satisfying the given condition.\n\n6. **Substituent Positions**:\n   - Position 1: Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n   - Position 2: Dimethylamino (-N(CH\u2083)\u2082).\n   - Position 3: Carbaldehyde (-CHO).\n   - Position 4: Methoxy (-OCH\u2083).\n   - Position 5: Cyano (-CN).\n   - Position 6: Hydroxyl (-OH).\n\n7. **Alphabetical Order of Substituents**: In the IUPAC name, substituents are listed in alphabetical order:\n   - Cyano (-CN) comes first.\n   - Formyl (-CHO) comes next.\n   - Hydroxyl (-OH) follows.\n   - Methoxy (-OCH\u2083) follows.\n   - Dimethylamino (-N(CH\u2083)\u2082) comes last.\n\n8. **Final Name**: Incorporating the positions and alphabetical order, the correct IUPAC name is:\n   **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches **Option A**.\n\nAnswer: A"
