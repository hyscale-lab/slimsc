A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it has at least one stereocenter and no plane of symmetry that makes it superimposable on its mirror image. Below is the analysis for each compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond with substituents arranged in the Z configuration. However, there are no stereocenters, and the molecule lacks chirality. **No optical activity.**\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound has stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, and the E configuration of the double bond contributes to the asymmetry. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. **Optical activity.**\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is a symmetrical molecule, and the (2R,3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral. **No optical activity.**\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: In this case, both stereocenters have the same configuration (R), which breaks the symmetry of the molecule. The lack of a plane of symmetry makes it chiral. **Optical activity.**\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The hydroxyl group on C1 is attached to four different substituents (two ring carbons, a hydrogen, and the hydroxyl group itself), making C1 a stereocenter. The molecule is chiral. **Optical activity.**\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The three hydroxyl groups are positioned symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring, creating a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule a meso compound and achiral. **No optical activity.**\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound does not have any stereocenters, as all substituents are symmetrically arranged. **No optical activity.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, a total of **3** compounds are optically active.\n\n**Answer: B**"
