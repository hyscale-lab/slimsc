Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Reaction 1**: Cyclooctatetraene reacts with maleic anhydride in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a bicyclic structure (product 1) with the endo rule determining the stereochemistry.\n\n2. **Reaction 2**: Product 1 is esterified with methanol and sulfuric acid, converting the anhydride into a dimethyl ester (product 2), retaining the stereochemistry from product 1.\n\n3. **Reaction 3**: Product 2 reacts with cyclopentadiene in another Diels-Alder reaction, with the endo rule dictating the stereochemistry of the new substituents.\n\nThe major isomer of product 3 is determined by the stereochemical outcomes of both Diels-Alder reactions, both favoring the endo rule. Among the options, option B aligns with the expected stereochemical outcome.\n\nAnswer: B"
