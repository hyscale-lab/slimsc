Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy U = ½ kx². The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I think I can't use the classical expressions directly. Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max class is found by setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy. So, (1/2)mv² = ½ kA². Wait, no, actually, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². And at maximum speed, all of that is kinetic. So E = ½ mv²_classical. Solving that gives v² = (kA²)/m, so v_max_classical = sqrt(kA²/m) = (A√k/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. Since the question is relativistic, option C is probably not the answer. But let's check.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy. However, in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just ½ kx² anymore. Or is it? Wait, no, the question says it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx, so the potential is still U = ½ kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but how is the total energy handled here? In the classical case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, each proportional to x². But relativistically, the kinetic energy depends on velocity, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy in terms of the oscillator's maximum amplitude. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which would be the maximum speed.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, does the total energy change? Or perhaps the maximum speed is such that the total energy (kinetic plus potential) equals the relativistic expressions.

Let me think. The total energy E of the oscillator in the relativistic case should still be the sum of kinetic energy (K) and potential energy (U). So E = K + U. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so K = 0, E = ½ k A². This should be the same as the energy at any other point.

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So E = K = (gamma - 1) m c². But E is also equal to ½ k A². So setting them equal:

(gamma
