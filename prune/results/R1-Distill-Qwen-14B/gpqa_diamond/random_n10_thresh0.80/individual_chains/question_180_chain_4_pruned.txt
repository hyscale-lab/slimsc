Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e... Oh right, the elementary charge is e, so each has double that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, so I guess I calculate and pick the right one.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy between point charges is calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

Since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate all the pairwise interactions and sum them up. But wait, how many pairs are there? Let me think. If all the 13 charges were free to move, but in this case, 12 are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, so the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So maybe the potential energy comes from two parts: the interaction between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, and the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained at 2m from P. Are they arranged in some configuration, like a sphere? Because if they're all at the same distance from P but not interacting with each other, that might not be possible. Oh wait, no; the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of them is 2 m away from P, but what about their distance from each other? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that they are far apart compared to their size, such that the potential energy between them is negligible? No, wait, but 12 identical charges at the same distance from a central point... Maybe they form a regular icosahedron or something. But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual potentials.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, so maybe the 12 charges are placed as far away as possible from each other to minimize the potential energy due to their mutual repulsion. But when charges are positive, the potential energy is positive (since repulsion), so to minimize the total energy, maybe I can just consider the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 others, because the mutual energy among the 12 might be very large, but perhaps in this problem, it's neglected or considered to be zero? Wait, the problem states "minimum energy of this system." That suggests that perhaps we are to find the minimum possible energy, which might involve some arrangement where the mutual potential energies are minimized, but how?

Wait, alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are fixed at
