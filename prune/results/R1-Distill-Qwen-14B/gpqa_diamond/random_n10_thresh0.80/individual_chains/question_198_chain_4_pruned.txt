Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. Stability constants, right. So, the Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- in different stoichiometries. The stability constants β1 to β4 correspond to the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN ligands.

Wait, I think the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, for example, β1 would be for Co(SCN), which is [Co(SCN)]^+ / (Co^2+ [SCN^-]) ). But wait, let me think about the charges. Co^2+ with one SCN^- would form [Co(SCN)]^+, so the charge would be +1. But I'm not sure about that, maybe the complexes are neutral or other charges. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) or something else. Hmm, but maybe that's not essential right now.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because two SCN^- would balance the +2 charge of Co^2+. So that would be the third complex, β3=63. Because β3 is the formation constant for the complex with three ligands? Wait, no. Wait, β1 is for one ligand, β2 for two, etc. Or maybe βn is the cumulative constant for n ligands? Or perhaps each β is for a step-wise formation.

Wait, I need to clarify. The stability constants are generally given as β1, β2, etc., where each β is for the nth step. So, for the first complex, β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+/ (
