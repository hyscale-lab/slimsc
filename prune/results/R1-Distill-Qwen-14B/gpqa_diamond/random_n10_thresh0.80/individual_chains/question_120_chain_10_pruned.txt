Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So a higher plx means closer star.

The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means they spread out evenly in all directions. But how does that affect the number of stars we see with a certain range of parallax?

Wait, let's think about it. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So stars with small parallax are far away, and those with large parallax are nearby. If the distribution is uniform, the number density of stars depends on the volume. But wait, in a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a volume would be proportional to the volume itself.

But we're considering a range of parallaxes. So maybe we need to figure out how many stars fall into a given parallax interval, say from plx to plx + dplx, which corresponds to a range in distance.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by a small amount dplx, the corresponding distance change is dd = d(d)/d(plx) * dplx. Let me compute that derivative. d = 1/plx, so derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx^2). So dd = ( -1/plx^2 ) * dplx. But since plx increases as d decreases, perhaps I should consider the absolute value, so the distance change is (1/plx^2) * dplx.

Wait, maybe another approach. The number of stars in a shell between distances d and d+dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density. Volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So if the number density is n (stars per volume), then number of stars N is n * 4π r² dr.

But since d is the distance, and plx is 1/d, we can express this in terms of plx. Let's change variables from d to plx. So d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = (d(plx))/d
