Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to think about each option. Let me start by recalling what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then later removing it by taking a limit or renormalizing.

So the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. That means the correct theory doesn't have these divergences, or perhaps handles them in a different way without needing regularization.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a type of quantum theory that replaces point particles with strings. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because they work at higher energies and require extra dimensions, maybe they don't need regularization. Or do they? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that in perturbative string theory, calculations can sometimes lead to divergences, but maybe they don't require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs. Or perhaps they naturally avoid it because of the way they handle interactions.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does require renormalization. Because of things like the running coupling constant and the behavior at different energy scales, you definitely have divergences that need to be handled.
