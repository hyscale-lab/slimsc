Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the given solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, I remember that stability constants tell us about the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to a complex. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN)1^2+, β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co^2+, so that's the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, right? So that's the second complex, with β2=40.

But wait, I might be mixing up the terminology. Blue is the color of the [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato, so n=2. So we need to find the concentration of this complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration c(Co) includes all forms: the free Co^2+ ions and all the complexes. So, c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^2-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]. Or wait, wait. Wait, the charge on the complexes: Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m, the charge m would be 2 - n. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+, n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-, so that's n=2. So we're dealing with [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact complexes, but maybe that's not the critical point here.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (or whatever the correct charge is), I need to find the concentration of that complex relative to all the other species.

I think the approach here is to use the stability constants and set up the expressions for each complex, then compute their concentrations relative to each other.

The general approach for such problems is to express each complex in terms of the free ions and the stability constants. The total cobalt is the sum of all the species.

Let me denote the free [Co^2+] as x. Then, each complex can be expressed as:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are defined as βn, which is the formation constant for the nth complex. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, all the complexes can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]. The total cobalt is the sum of all these, plus the free [Co^2+].

So, c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

We can factor out [Co^2+] from each term:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] * [1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-}^4 ]

We can solve for [Co^2+] because we know c(Co) and [SCN^-].

Let me plug in the numbers:

c(Co) = 1e-2 M
[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

So, the denominator inside the brackets:

1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

Let me compute each term:

β1*(0.1)=9 * 0.1 =0.9
β2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4
β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063
β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now add all these plus 1:

1 +0.9 =1.9 → +0.4 → 2.3 → +0.063 →2.363 → +0.0016 →2.3646.

So, denominator D = 2.3646.

So, [Co^2+] = c(Co) / D = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if [Co^2+] is 4.223e-3, and the total c(Co) is 1e-2, that would mean [Co^2+] is about 42% of the total. But let me check: 4.223e-3 is 0.004223, and 1e-2 is 0.01. So 0.004223 / 0.01 = 0.4223, so about 42% free Co^2+.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, no, no, because [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, perhaps. Wait, let me think. The charge would be 2+ minus 2*(−1) → 0. So neutral.

But regardless, the concentration is [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2.

So, the concentration we're interested in is β2 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 4.223e-3 * (0.01) = 40 * 4.223e-5 = 1.6892e-3 M.

But wait, let me compute that correctly:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * (4.223e-3) * 0.01 = 40 * 4.223e-5 = 40 * 4.223e-5 = 1.6892e-3 M.

Now, to find the percentage of this species, we take [Co(SCN)_2] divided by the total c(Co), which is 1e-2 M.

So, percentage = (1.6892e-3 / 1e-2) * 100 = (0.16892) *100 = 16.892%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations, because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute the denominator.

So, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 * [SCN]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Adding all these to 1:

1+0.9=1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So yes, D=2.3646. So [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2 =40 *0.004223 *0.01.

Wait, 40 * 0.004223 = 0.16892; 0.16892 *0.01=0.0016892 M.

So, 0.0016892 is 1.6892e-3 M.

Percentage is (1.6892e-3 / 1e-2) *100= 16.892%, which rounds to 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, the options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So the correct answer should be D.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering which complex is which. Oh wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato complexes". I'm pretty sure that [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. But perhaps the dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

Another thought: wait, the stability constants could be for different complexes. Wait, the β1 is the first complex, which is [CoSCN^+], β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^–, β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2–.

So, when looking for [Co(SCN)_2], the stability constant is β2=40. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but wait, another point: when we have multiple complexes, sometimes the formation is stepwise, so each βn is the formation constant for the nth step. So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 to βn. But wait, no, the way the question presents β, it's the overall stability constant for each complex. Wait, no, βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, so [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

I think I got that right. So, the calculation seems correct.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

### Step 1: Express the total cobalt concentration
The total cobalt concentration includes all species:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]
Factoring out \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\), we get:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot \left(1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4\right)
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
Substitute \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\) and the stability constants:
\[
1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4
\]
\[
1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.01) + 63(0.001) + 16(0.0001)
\]
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\)
Using \(c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\):
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{2.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\)
The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is given by:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2
\]
Substitute \(\beta_2 = 40\), \([\text{Co}^{2+}] = 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\):
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 40 \cdot (4.223 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (0.1)^2
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 40 \cdot 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01 = 1.6892 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\)
The percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{1.6892 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \cdot 100 = 16.892\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.

**Answer: D**
