Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives information about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and extinction (E(B-V)) in some cases. The key point is that each spectrograph can observe stars up to a certain V magnitude. ESPRESSO can go down to 17 mag, and HIRES can go to 16 mag. So, the star needs to be bright enough (apparent V magnitude ≤ 17 for ESPRESSO, ≤16 for HIRES) to be detected by both.

Wait, no, wait. The question is asking which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So each star must be observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So, the star's apparent magnitude should be ≤16 because that's the more restrictive condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (like 15), both can see it. But if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me read the question again. The question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, apparent V mag ≤17. With HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16.

So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16. So, the star must be brighter than 16 mag in V. Because if it's 16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since it's brighter than 16), but ESPRESSO can.

So, the first thing is to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust extinction) which affects the apparent magnitude. Because some stars have E(B-V), which relates to extinction in the V band.

Extinction (A_V) is calculated from E(B-V) using A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, for each star, if they have E(B-V), we have to calculate A_V and then find the apparent magnitude from the absolute magnitude plus distance modulus plus extinction.

Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude m is:

m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V

Where M is the absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction in V band.

So for each star, let's compute the apparent V magnitude.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude M = 15.5 mag.
- Distance d = 10 pc.
- No extinction (E(B-V) not given? Wait, the question says Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V). So Star1 doesn't have any extinction. So A_V = 0.

So m = 15.5 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 5 log10(1) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 mag.

So apparent mag is 15.5. That's less than 16, so both spectrographs can see it. But wait, the options don't have Star1 in all the options. Let me check the options again. Options are A to D, which include combinations of Star4, 5, 3, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So, Star1's apparent mag is 15.5, which is detectable by both. So, if an option includes Star1 and another, but looking at the options, only D includes Star1 and Star4.

But let's continue.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag is given as 16.5 mag. Wait, the question says Star2 has an apparent V mag of 16.5. No E(B-V), so no extinction. So m =16.5. So, for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, that's too faint. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star2 can't be detected by both, only ESPRESSO. So options that include Star2: option C includes Star2 and Star3. So only Star2 is 16.5, so it's too faint for HIRES. So option C is out.

Star3:
- Apparent V mag is 15.5 mag. But wait, Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V =3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

Wait, but wait. The apparent magnitude given is already the observed value, right? Or is it the intrinsic magnitude before extinction?

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6. So, I'm a bit confused. Do I need to correct the apparent magnitude for extinction? Or is the given apparent magnitude already the observed one.

Wait, I think the given m is the observed apparent magnitude, which includes extinction. So, for stars with extinction, the observed m is dimmer than the actual m without extinction. But wait, when the question says, for Star3, apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed (i.e., already including extinction), so the actual (intrinsic) would be brighter. But that's not necessary for our calculation.

Wait, but in our calculation, we have:

m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V

But if the apparent magnitude is already observed (so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V), then is the given m_observed already including A_V? Or is the given m the intrinsic, and we have to add A_V?

I think I need to clarify. If a star has extinction, the apparent magnitude increases (becomes fainter) because light is absorbed. So if the star's absolute magnitude is M, and without extinction, its apparent magnitude would be m0. But with extinction, m = m0 + A_V.

In the case of Star3, the given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V = 1.86. So, the observed m is 15.5. But that would imply that the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But that's not necessary for our calculation because we're given the apparent magnitude as observed, so it's already including the extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for apparent magnitude m is:

m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10) + A_V.

So M is the absolute magnitude (intrinsic), d is distance, and A_V is the extinction. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude that is already observed (so, includes A_V), then how do we proceed?

Wait, perhaps in the question, the given apparent magnitudes for some stars (like Star2 and Star3) have already been corrected for extinction. Or perhaps not. Because Star2 gives an apparent V mag of 16.5, but it doesn't mention extinction. Star3 gives apparent V mag of 15.5 and extinction. So, perhaps for Star3, we have to calculate its m after considering A_V.

Wait, no. Let me see. The question says: for Star3 and Star4, we have E(B-V). So, for Star3, given the apparent V mag is 15.5, but we have extinction. So is this apparent magnitude before or after correction? Because in astronomy, extinction makes objects appear dimmer, so their apparent magnitude increases.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is without considering extinction. Because when you have E(B-V), you can compute the extinction and correct the apparent magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured such that the given apparent magnitude (when provided) is the observed one, which includes extinction. So, for example, Star2's apparent mag is 16.5, which is after considering extinction because it doesn't have any E(B-V). Star3's apparent mag is given, but we have E(B-V), so perhaps we need to calculate its actual apparent mag (corrected for extinction) because the given apparent mag is without extinction.

Wait, that might make sense. Because when a star has extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V, where m0 is the apparent mag without extinction.

But if E(B-V) is given, so A_V is known, then m_observed = m0 + A_V. So m0 = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, but for stars that don't have E(B-V), like Star1 and Star2, their m is the observed (including any extinction, but since E(B-V) isn't given, perhaps they have no extinction, or it's negligible. So for Star3, perhaps the apparent mag given is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we need to compute the observed m by adding A_V.

Or maybe the other way around: the given apparent mag is already the observed one. So, for Star3, even though it's affected by extinction, its apparent mag is 15.5, so that's the m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's perhaps clarify.

The formula to compute the apparent magnitude of a star when considering extinction is:

m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V

where m_intrinsic is the apparent magnitude if there were no extinction.

In the question, for some stars, the apparent V mag is given. For Star3, E(B-V) is provided, so A_V can be calculated.

So, to get the observed m, we can either:

1. If the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then m_observed = m + A_V.

OR

2. If the given m is the observed (including extinction), then m_observed is already known, and A_V has no effect on it.

But I think it's more likely that the given m for each star is the intrinsic (without considering extinction), so we have to compute m_observed by adding A_V.

Wait, but for Star1, M=15.5, d=10, no extinction: so m = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) =15.5.

For Star2, apparent V is 16.5, which includes any extinction (but since E(B-V) is not given, perhaps there's no extinction, so m_observed is 16.5).

For Star3, the given m is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. Therefore, the observed m would be m = 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it too bright.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Because if the given m is 15.5 without extinction, then adding A_V would make it 15.5 +1.86=17.36. But then, that's a very dim star, which would only be visible to ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is already the observed value, so we don't need to add A_V. But then, how do we account for extinction?

Wait, let me think about the formula.

The distance modulus is M + 5 log (d/10) = m0, where m0 is the apparent magnitude without any extinction. So, the observed m is m0 + A_V.

So, the formula is m = M +5 log (d/10) + A_V.

In that case, for Star3, m = M +5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, but the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So perhaps that's the m0, without extinction. So, the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So, Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit (brighter than 17 mag is detectable). Wait, but wait, ESPRESSO can detect up to 17. So, if the star's apparent mag is 17.36, which is fainter than 17, so it's not detectable by ESPRESSO either.

Wait, but that would mean Star3 can't be detected by either. But wait, that can't be right because the question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitudes (for Star2 and Star3) are the observed m, which include the extinction, so we don't need to add A_V again. So, for Star3, observed m is 15.5, which is already less than 16.5. So that's too faint for HIRES (which can only go up to 16), but ESPRESSO can see it (up to 17). So can both detect it?

Wait, no. Because for Star3, m_observed =15.5. So, both spectrographs can detect it, because 15.5 is ≤16 (HIRES limit is 16) and ≤17 (ESPRESSO). So, Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but what about extinction? If the given m already includes the extinction, then we don't need to do any further correction. So, for Star3, m=15.5, so it's 15.5, which is within both's detection limits.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

The question states: for simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits and altitudes. So, the only thing that matters is whether the star's apparent V magnitude is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES), regardless of other factors.

So, for each star, calculate apparent V mag, considering any extinction (if given), and see if it's ≤16 (so both can detect) or ≤17 but only ESPRESSO can.

Hmm.

Let's proceed for each star.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction.

m = 15.5 +5*log10(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5. So, m=15.5.

So, both ESPRESSO (≤17) and HIRES (≤16) can detect it. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: apparent V=16.5, no extinction.

So, m=16.5. HIRES can't detect (since 16.5 >16), but ESPRESSO can. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

Wait, but here's the confusion: is the given apparent V magnitude (15.5) the intrinsic or observed?

If the given m is without extinction, then the observed m would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V =15.5 +1.86=17.36. So, m=17.36.

But that's brighter than 17 (wait, wait, magnitudes are such that lower numbers are brighter. So 17.36 is fainter than 17. So, only ESPRESSO can detect, as it goes up to 17.

But that would make Star3's m=17.36, which is fainter than 17, so not detectable by ESPRESSO either? No, wait, 17.36 is fainter than 17, meaning it's beyond ESPRESSO's limit. So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

Alternatively, if the given apparent V=15.5 is already the observed value, including extinction, then no correction is needed. So, m=15.5, which is ≤16, so both can detect it.

But which scenario is correct? The way the question is written, the apparent V magnitude is given for Star3 as 15.5, and E(B-V) is provided. So, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we need to compute the observed m.

Wait, but that would make the observed m = m_intrinsic + A_V. So, m=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but that can't be right because it would make the star too faint. So perhaps the given m for Star3 is the observed (including extinction), so no correction is needed. So, m=15.5, and both can detect it.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to proceed with both approaches and see which makes sense.

Let me proceed with the assumption that the apparent V magnitude given is the observed value, which includes any extinction. So, for Star3, m=15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So, compute m.

m = M +5 log10(10/10) + A_V =15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

So, m=16.74. That's above 16, so HIRES can't detect it (HIRES only up to 16). But ESPRESSO can, as it goes up to 17. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc, no extinction.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) → log(0.5) is -0.3010.

So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

So m=16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995 ≈15.0 mag.

So, m=15.0, which is ≤16, so both can detect it.

Wait, but wait. Wait, distance modulus is M +5 log10(d/10). So for d=5, d/10=0.5. Log10(0.5)= -0.3010. 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So, m =16.5 -1.505=14.995 ~15.0.

So, Star5's m is 15.0, which is within both spectrographs' limits.

So, let's summarize:

Star1: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 (if given m is observed) → can be detected by both.

But if the given m for Star3 is the intrinsic, then m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36 → only ESPRESSO can detect (but 17.36 is fainter than 17, so no, even ESPRESSO can't detect).

Wait, that's conflicting. So, I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m for Star3 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So, to get the observed m, we add A_V.

So, Star3: m_intrinsic=15.5, A_V=1.86 → m_observed=17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's 17 limit. So can't be detected by either.

Wait, but that's making Star3 not detectable, which conflicts with the initial thought.

I think perhaps the given m in the question is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction, and we have to compute the actual m_observed by adding A_V if applicable.

So for Star3:

m_intrinsic =15.5.

E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86.

m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is fainter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can't detect, HIRES can't either.

So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Hmm, but that's a problem because in the options, Star3 is in option C and B.

Let me proceed with the assumption that the given m for Star3 and Star4 is the intrinsic (without extinction), so we have to compute the observed m by adding A_V.

So:

Star3: m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36 → can't be detected by either.

Star4: m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74 → can't be detected by HIRES.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

Wait, but Star5's m is 15.0, so both can detect.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

So, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m_observed=16.74, which is above 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect. So option D is out.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m is 17.36, can't be detected. So option B is out.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so option A is out.

Option D includes Star1 (m=15.5, detected by both) and Star4 (m=16.74, only ESPRESSO). So, Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, so only Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But looking at the options, no option matches that. The options are A to D as listed earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3: m=17.36 → only ESPRESSO (if Star3 is 17.36, but wait, 17.36 is beyond ESPRESSO's 17 limit. So Star3 can't be detected by either. So option B is out.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO. Star3: can't be detected by either. So option C is out.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1: can be detected by both. Star4: can't be detected by HIRES. So option D is out.

Wait, but the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0).

But the options don't have an option that includes both Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations for each star.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction.

m =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5 → both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: M=15.5, d=15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6.

So, d=15 pc.

m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(15/10) =15.5 +5 log(1.5).

Log(1.5)=0.1761.

5*0.1761=0.8805.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 +0.8805≈16.38.

Then, A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m_observed=16.38 +1.86=18.24.

Wait, that's even higher, making it even fainter. So, m=18.24, which is beyond both's limits.

Wait, but earlier I thought m for Star3 is 15.5, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5. So, that's the m_observed. But wait, if that's the case, regardless of E(B-V), then we don't need to do anything, because the given m is already the observed. So, Star3's m is 15.5 ≤16, so both detect.

But wait, the E(B-V) is given, which would imply that the apparent magnitude would be affected by extinction. So, perhaps the given m is without extinction, and we have to compute the observed m.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me think again.

If a star has E(B-V), its observed apparent magnitude (what we measure) is dimmer than the intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude. So, m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But in the question, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So, that must be the observed m. So, no need to add A_V again. Because the given m is already the observed, which includes extinction.

So, for Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m_intrinsic.

m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(10/10) =15.5.

Then, m_observed =15.5 + A_V (1.24) →16.74.

So, m=16.74, which is above 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc, no extinction.

m_intrinsic =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

So, m=15.0 → both can detect.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

Now, looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected → this is a possible option.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So, option B includes Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5, so both can detect. So option B is Star3 and Star5, both can be detected.

But wait, let me check Star3 again.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5. So, m=15.5, which is ≤16. So both can detect. Star5: m=15.0, so both.

So, option B is correct.

But wait, earlier I had a confusion about whether the given m for Star3 includes extinction or not. But according to the question, Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, and E(B-V) is given. So, that suggests that the given m is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed m by adding A_V. But that would make m=15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit. But that can't be right because the option B would then be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent mag is the observed value (so it already includes extinction), so no correction is needed.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5, both can detect. Star5's m=15.0, both can detect. So, option B is correct.

But why would the question provide E(B-V) if the given m already includes extinction? That might not make sense. Because E(B-V) is used to calculate A_V, which is then added to the intrinsic m to get the observed m.

So, perhaps the given m for Star3 is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the E(B-V) is provided to compute the observed m.

So, for Star3:

m_intrinsic =15.5.

A_V=1.86.

m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36 → which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit of 17 (since 17.36 is fainter, higher magnitude). So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

But that would leave Star5 as the only star (besides Star1) that can be detected by both.

So, Star5's m is 15.0, which is within both's limits.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

So, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1 and Star5.

But none of the options include both. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3: cannot detect, Star5: can detect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2: cannot detect with HIRES, Star3: cannot detect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1: can detect, Star4: cannot detect with HIRES.

So, the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5, but no option includes both.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5.

Wait, Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m_intrinsic =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So, m=15.0, which is within both's limits.

So, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both.

But looking at the options, none includes both. So perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine Star3's situation.

Alternative approach: If the apparent magnitude given is the observed (already includes extinction), then we can ignore E(B-V) because m is already corrected.

So, for Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. But since m is already observed, we don't need to adjust. So, Star3's m=15.5, both can detect.

Similarly, Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m_intrinsic: 15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Which is fainter than 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect.

So, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

So, option B would be the correct answer.

So, the answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Key Calculations and Analysis for Each Star:

  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- **Given**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**  
- **Given**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
- **Extinction**:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]  
- **Interpretation**: The given \( m = 15.5 \) is the **observed apparent magnitude**, which already includes extinction. Therefore, no further correction is needed.  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star4**  
- **Given**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
- **Extinction**:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
- **Apparent magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star5**  
- **Given**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
- **Apparent magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 \approx 15.0
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.
