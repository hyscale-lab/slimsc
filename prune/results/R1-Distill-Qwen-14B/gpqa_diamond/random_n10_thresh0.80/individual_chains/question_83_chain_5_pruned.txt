Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I should do is find out the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, right, dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that makes sense because doubling the volume halves the concentration.

So now, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, they'll react completely.

The next part is the titration. The volume of NaOH used is 25% of the equivalence point volume. Wait, but wait, to find the equivalence point, I need to know how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid.

So let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume is 2.5 cm³ (since 10 * 0.25 = 2.5). So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me find out how many moles of NaOH that is. NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so moles = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid that have reacted are 0.00025. So initial acetic acid was 0.001 moles, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

But wait, when NaOH is added to acetic acid, it converts some of it into its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the solution will have both acetic acid and acetate ions. This is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.74 (since log(1.85e-5) is about 4.74, so negative log is 4.74? Wait wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, about 4.73.

So at 25% titration, the moles of acetate (A^-) will be equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 moles. The remaining acetic acid (HA) is 0.00075 moles.

But wait, I need to account for the total volume of the solution at this point. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2
