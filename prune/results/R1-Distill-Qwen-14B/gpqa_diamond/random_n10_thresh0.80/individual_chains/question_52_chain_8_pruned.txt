Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), they notice that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy)
- E is the energy of the level
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

Wait, but the ratio given is n1/n2, right? Because the question states the ratio decreases. So if the ratio n1/n2 is going down, that means n2 increases relative to n1, which would happen when temperature increases because higher temperatures make the distribution more spread out, so higher energy levels get more populated.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-Î”E/(kT)). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So n2 increases with T.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs. 6000 K). So when the star has spots, T decreases. So at lower T, n2/n1 would be smaller, meaning n1/n2 would be larger. But the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when there are spots. Wait, that can't be right. Because lower T should cause n2/n1 to decrease, so n1/n2 would increase. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify. The observed ratio is n1/n2. So when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower. So if the overall Teff is lower, then the ratio n1/n2 would increase because at lower temperatures, the lower energy level is more populated. So higher n1, lower n2, so n1/n2 goes up. But the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. That seems contradictory. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when there are no spots. So when the
