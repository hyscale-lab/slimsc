Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. In this case, it's calcium. So, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion, which means it's made of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (I think EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form when it's binding, so the charge would be 4-). The formula of the complex would be something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

The formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The larger the K, the more stable the complex, meaning the complex doesn't dissociate much. So, in this case, with K being so large, the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions should be very low, because almost all the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Let me think about the equation. The formation of the complex would be:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Wait, wait, no, the formula is CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA. So, the reaction is:

Ca^2+ + Y^4- → CaY^2-.

The formation constant K is given by [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) ) = K.

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M.

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning that all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. But
