Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such problems, the Boltzmann equation comes into play, right? Let me think.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2's. Oh wait, wait, no, it's more precise than that. The energy difference between the specific energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, and both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can apply the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where n2 and n1 are the populations, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, let me parse that again. It says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Oh, wait, so the ratio n1/n2 is 2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, because if the excitation is higher in star_1, that would mean more atoms are in the higher energy level (assuming the energy difference is the same, but maybe the temperature affects it). Or perhaps the ratio is of the excitation, so if star_1's excitation is higher, then n_upper for star_1 is higher. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much. Let's clarify. Let's say the number of iron atoms in the specific (higher?) energy level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2, where n1 is for star_1 and n2 for star_2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation gives the ratio between two energy levels. Let me think. Let me denote the two energy levels as E_upper and E_lower, but in the problem, it might not matter because the energy difference is given. So for each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower would be determined by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and for star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

But the question is about the relative excitation. Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the upper to lower level in each star, and star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. Or perhaps the other way around. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the excited state (n_upper) compared to the lower state. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher for star_1 than for star_2.

But the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So perhaps n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper /n2_lower) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

Let me denote for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) as follows:

For star 1: ratio R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: ratio R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Taking the natural log on both sides:

ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2)

But R1
