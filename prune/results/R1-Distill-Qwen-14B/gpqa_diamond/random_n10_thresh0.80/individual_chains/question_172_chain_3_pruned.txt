Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me see. The question is about why the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. That's the thing that tells us about the distribution of particles in different energy states based on temperature, right?

So, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, wait, here E2 is higher than E1 because it's an excited state. Oh wait, no, wait. The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy levels are different.

In the question, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So in star_1, the population in that higher energy level is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: n1 is the number in star_1, n2 in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, the problem says twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of excitation. Let's say, the excitation is the population in the higher level compared to the lower. Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, let's parse the question again. It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, maybe the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, the ratio n_excited / n_ground is different.

Wait, but the question gives the energy difference between the energy levels as 1.38e-23 J. So each star has the same energy levels, I think. Because the same iron atoms are considered.

So for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state (say, level 2) compared to the ground state (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n1_2 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -Î”E/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2, n
