Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems because they don't give meaningful physical results. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite so you can renormalize them, right?

Let me think about each option. 

Option A is Superstring Theory. I know that string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. One of the key things about string theory is that it's a theory of quantum gravity. I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "point particle" is avoided because strings have length scales. Also, I think that in string theory, the interactions are different and maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or wait, do they? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think that in some cases, string theories don't require the same kind of divergent regularization because the theory is inherently different. Maybe they don't need as much regularization as other QFTs because the structure is different.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and quarks behave almost like free particles. But wait, QCD calculations do involve loops and divergences, so I think regularization is needed. Like, for calculating things like beta functions and other QCD processes, you have to regularize them. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED definitely requires regularization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's magnetic moment, where you get divergent terms. These are handled by regularization and then renormalization. So C needs regularization.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum effects, so they don't have the same divergences that quantum theories have. In classical E&M, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but those are handled differently, maybe through the use of distributions or other mathematical tools. But the question is about regularization in the context of high energies, which is more of a quantum field theory concern. Since classical theories don't use regularization in the quantum sense, D might be the answer.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if I'm right, the only theory that doesn't need regularization in the quantum sense is the classical one. Because the others (A, B, C) are quantum theories and would require regularization. But wait, I thought Superstring Theory is a quantum theory as well. So the only option left is D, Classical Electrodynamics, because it's not a quantum theory, so it doesn't need regularization at high energies.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Regularization is a procedure used in quantum field theories to handle divergences. So any classical theory wouldn't need regularization because it doesn't have these
