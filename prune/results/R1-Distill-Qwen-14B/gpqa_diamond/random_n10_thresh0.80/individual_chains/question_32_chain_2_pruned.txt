Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question here must be a heavy one. The problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's Li-6, I think. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The question is about the energy of the collider. I think the energy refers to the kinetic energy each ion has when it's moving at 0.96c. But wait, sometimes in particle physics, the energy can be the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. I need to clarify that. Oh wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the total energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the kinetic energy. Hmm. I'll proceed and see.

First, I need to calculate the total energy or the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Let's think about the formula. The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The speed v is given as 0.96c. So let's calculate gamma. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0c²) of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is the atomic mass. I think the atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So the mass number is 6, so m = 6 * u.

Wait, but wait. The mass number is 6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is slightly less than 6 u because of the binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate m0c² as (6 u)c². Alternatively, perhaps we can use the exact mass in terms of atomic mass units and then convert to energy.

Wait, another approach: the rest energy m0c² is equal to the mass in atomic mass units multiplied by 931 MeV/u. So 1 u is approximately 931 MeV. So for Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6 u, m0c² = 6 * 931 MeV = 5586 MeV, which is 5.586 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of Li-6 might be a bit less than 6 u because the actual mass is less due to the mass defect (Einstein's equation). But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 u. But wait, I'm actually not sure. Maybe the problem expects me to just use m0c² as 6 u, or perhaps the exact value is given elsewhere, but since the problem doesn't provide it, I probably have to proceed with the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton as 938 MeV/c², and a neutron as about 939 MeV/c², so adding them up. Let me think: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m0c² = 3*(m_p c²) + 3*(m_n c²).

m_p is about 938 MeV/c². m_n is a bit more, about 939.565 MeV/c². So m0c² = 3*(938) +3*(939.565) = 3*(1877.565) → 3 * 1877.565 = 5632.695 MeV. 5632.695 MeV is 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, that's more precise. Let me calculate that exactly. 3 * 938 = 2814, 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695. Adding them gives 5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

But wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually less than 6 * 938 MeV because of the binding energy. Oh wait, no, the binding energy is the energy released when the nucleus forms, so the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So the actual m0c² of Li-6 is less than 5.6327 GeV.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any specific mass, so perhaps we can proceed with the sum of the individual particles' rest masses. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation using the mass number A=6, so m0c² = A * 931 MeV. So 6 * 931 = 5586 MeV = 5.586 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a deuteron or something else, but I think the correct approach is to use A=6, so m0c² is 6 * 931 MeV, which is 5.586 GeV.

But wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units. So if 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², then 6.015 u would be 6.015 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.015 * 931.5 ≈ 13.9725 MeV. So total is 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV ≈5.60297 GeV.

Hmm, but perhaps that's more precise than needed. I think the problem expects me to just use the rest mass as 6 u, which would be 5.586 GeV.

Wait, but maybe the exact number is needed. Let's think again. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0150 u. So m0c² = 6.0150 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0150 * 931.5 ≈ let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015 * 931.5 = 13.9725 MeV.

Adding them gives 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

So m0c² ≈5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0c². Gamma was approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5.603.

Let me break it down. 3 *5.603=16.809.

0.5714 *5.603: 0.5 *5.603=2.8015, 0.0714 *5.603≈0.4016. So total about 2.8015+0.4016=3.2031.

Adding that to 16.809 gives 16.809 + 3.2031 ≈20.0121 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.012 GeV.

But wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.603.

Let me do it step by step.

5.603 * 3.5 = 5.603 *3 =16.809, 5.603 *0.5=2.8015 → 16.809 +2.8015=19.6105.

Then 5.603 *0.0714 = let's compute 5.603 *0.07 = 0.39221, 5.603 *0.0014=0.0078442. So total 0.39221 +0.0078442=0.4000542.

Adding to 19.6105: 19.6105 +0.4000542=20.01055 GeV.

So approximately 20.01055 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV.

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.603.

3.5714 ×5.603.

Compute 3.5714 ×5 =17.857

3.5714 ×0.603 → 3.5714 ×0.6 =2.14284, 3.5714 ×0.003=0.0107142. So 2.14284 +0.0107142=2.153554.

So total is 17.857 +2.153554=20.010554 GeV.

So about 20.0106 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Because earlier I approximated 1/0.28 as 3.5714, but perhaps the exact value is better.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c → v²/c² = 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²= 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.603 exactly.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.603:

Break it down:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 × 0.6 =2.142857142.
