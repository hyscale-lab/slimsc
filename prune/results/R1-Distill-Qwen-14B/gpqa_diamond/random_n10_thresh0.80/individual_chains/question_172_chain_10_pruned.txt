Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that the conditions in each photosphere can be treated as if they're in equilibrium.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, E2 > E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so in this case, for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another lower state) would depend on the temperature of the star.

The problem states that for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. I'm not exactly sure if that's n1/n2 = 2, but I think it's about the ratio of the populations. Let me clarify. If star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, that probably means that the ratio of excited to non-excited (or lower) states is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So, for star_1, n_excited / n_lower = something, and for star_2, it's half of that. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the question says "twice as excited"—so star_1's atoms are twice as likely to be in that excited state compared to star_2's. So, the ratio (n_excited)/(n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, let me define it properly. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is r1 = n1/n2, and for star_2, it's r2 = n1'/n2'. The problem says that r1 = 2 * r2.

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE =
