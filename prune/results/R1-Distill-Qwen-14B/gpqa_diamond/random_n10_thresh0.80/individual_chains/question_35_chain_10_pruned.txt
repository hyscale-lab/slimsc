Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and often used to represent spin-1/2 systems. The S matrix here must be one of them. Let me think: the standard Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Oh yes, that's exactly what S is here. So S is σy.

So the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. Since c is h/(4π), I should write that down. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since σy is a Pauli matrix, I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I remember that the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. 

So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(1) and c*(-1). Let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have h in the eigenvalues as such. Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait the question says the eigenvalue is 'a', so a = c * eigenvalue of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, then a would be ±c. So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which doesn't match because our eigenvalues are real numbers. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the eigenvalues of a spin-1/2 system for σy are ±1. So multiplying by c which is h/(4π), gives eigenvalues of ±h/(4π). But wait, h is Planck's constant, which has units of J·s. But in quantum mechanics, when we talk about angular momentum, the units are ħ (hbar) which is h/(2π). 

Wait another thing: sometimes, in these contexts, the spin matrices are multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, S is the spin operator. Oh wait, wait: in the problem statement, S is a 2x2 matrix, so it's likely representing the spin, and perhaps S is (σ/2) where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, wait the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). Which is exactly σy, so S is σy. So the operator Ay is c *
