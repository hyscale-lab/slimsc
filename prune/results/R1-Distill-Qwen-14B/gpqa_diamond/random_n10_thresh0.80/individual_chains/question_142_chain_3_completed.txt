Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are pure projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are more complicated.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ has equal weight, and then multiplied by 1/2. So it's a completely mixed state, meaning it's like being in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities.

Now the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices correspond to geometrical points. I recall that for a single qubit, the state space is a Bloch sphere. The Bloch representation maps density matrices to points on a unit sphere in 3D space.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix can be represented by the vector r. 

Let me break this down. The identity matrix I is 2x2. The term r·σ is the sum of the components of r multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So, if I have ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then when I expand this, I can find the components of r.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2. 

Wait, so ρ = I/2. How does this fit into the Bloch sphere representation? The general form is (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. Comparing this with ρ = I/2, that implies that (r·σ)/2 must be zero. So r must be the zero vector. Because any non-zero r would contribute something, but here, it's all zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Therefore, the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the north pole if r were (0,0,1), but that's not the case here. Option A is (1,1,0), which is not the case. Option D is all ones, which I don't think applies here.

So the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero, corresponding to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\( r = (1,1,0) \)) and **Option D** (\( r = (1,1,1) \)) are incorrect because they imply non-zero Bloch vectors, which would correspond to mixed states with specific orientations on the Bloch sphere.
- **Option B** (\( r = (0,0,1) \)) is incorrect because it corresponds to the north pole of the Bloch sphere, which would represent a pure state along the \( z \)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.
- **Option C** (\( r = (0,0,0) \)) is correct because it corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
