Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both pH values and see which option matches.

First, I should probably figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. Dilution affects the concentration, right? So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding equal volume of water. That should halve the concentration because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half.

Wait, wait, let me think. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Here, V1 and V2 are the same (20 cm³), so M2 is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) should produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So we'll have a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. The pH there should be greater than 7.

For the equivalence point, I need to find the concentration of the acetate ions. Let's see, the moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume. The volume is in liters, so for 20 cm³, it's 0.02 L.

Moles of CH3COOH initially = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be the same as moles of CH3COOH. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH used at equivalence point? The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (20 + 20). Then, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, so the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³.

But wait, maybe I need to think about the concentrations. Let's see, for equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate would be equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus the volume of NaOH added (which is 10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, to find pH at equivalence point, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

So Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root: x ≈
