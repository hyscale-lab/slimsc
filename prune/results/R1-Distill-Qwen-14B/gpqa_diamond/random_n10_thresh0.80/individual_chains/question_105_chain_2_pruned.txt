Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They say that when only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations show brightness variations because the star rotates, modulating the observed light. This setup can mimic an exoplanet's presence. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, I think the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what would be caused by an exoplanet transit. Because when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots on the star changing visibility as it rotates would cause brightness variations.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the star is covered with spots on one hemisphere, which causes brightness variations as it rotates. Without the spots, the same amplitude would be produced by an exoplanet. So, the signal from the exoplanet (the dip) should match the amplitude of the spot-induced variation.

So, first, I need to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by the planet transit and solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

Let me think about the brightness change due to spots. The spots are cooler (6000K - 1000K = 5000K). The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered. Wait, the star is a sphere, so one hemisphere is 50% of the surface area. Wait no, one hemisphere is half the surface. Wait, but the filling factor is 20%—so 20% of that hemisphere is spotted. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) = 0.4πR²? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire star's surface.

Wait no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface, and 20% of that is spots. So the total area with spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * π R²) ) multiplied by two hemispheres? Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere only. Wait, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the total spotted area would be 20% of one hemisphere, but since the other hemisphere isn't spotted, the total area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) / 2? Wait, perhaps I should model the total area as 0.2 * (π R²) ), because each hemisphere is half the star, and the filling factor is the fraction on that hemisphere. So each spot covers 20% of one hemisphere, meaning 0.2*(0.5 * 4π R²) = 0.4 π R²? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area with spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star is only showing one hemisphere at any given time. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So the maximum change in brightness would be when the spotted area is entirely visible or not.

Wait, but the problem says that the star is observed in a way that the brightness variations are periodic due to rotation. So the brightness change would vary as the area of the spots comes into view and then goes out of view.

Wait, but when the
