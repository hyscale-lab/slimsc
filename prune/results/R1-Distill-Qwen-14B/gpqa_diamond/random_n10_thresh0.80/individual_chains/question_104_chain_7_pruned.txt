Okay, so I need to figure out how the orbital periods of these two exoplanets compare. Both planets are around stars with the same mass as the Sun, and both have masses similar to Neptune. The detection method is the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Wait, the RV method detects the star's wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. So the amplitude of this shift is related to the mass of the planet and the properties of the orbit.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Since both stars are similar to the Sun and the planets have similar masses, the difference in the shift must come from other factors.

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity) is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. The formula is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star >> M_planet, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular, so that term is 1.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) )) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate this as:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (something with (M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and the orbital period. Let me rearrange the formula.

I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_earth) ) * ( (M_jup / (M_earth + M_p)) ) )^(-1/2) * ( (P/(yr)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula in terms of the period. Let me recall the relation between K and the period.

Wait, another approach. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But because M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_p/M_* is negligible, so (1 + M_p/M_*) ≈ 1, and (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*. So we can approximate it as:

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

But since e=0, that term is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/
