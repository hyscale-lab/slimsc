Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide... Oh wait, that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the general reaction is R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN.

But wait, what's the role of reagent A here? I think in the formation of cyanohydrins, you usually need an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile, so you protonate the carbonyl to make it more electrophilic. Common catalysts are H3O+ or maybe H2SO4. Oh, but in the options, the first part is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm.

So the first reaction uses NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, that makes sense because it's an acid catalyst. So that's probably option A or B for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the starting material has a nitrile group, and the product is a carboxylic acid. I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

Hydrolysis of nitriles typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Let me think: under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, and under basic conditions, they form carboxylate salts, which then can be acidified.

The starting material is a 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, the molecule is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the first product. Then, in the second reaction, it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done? I think it's done under acidic hydrolysis. The general reaction for nitrile to acid is using H3O+ (like H2SO4, HCl) as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes using HCl in aqueous conditions. Or maybe using a strong acid like H2SO4 with heat.

Wait, but the second reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. So what's B? Looking at the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again (option C), or CH3COOH (option D). So let's think about which is correct.

So the second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for that are HCl (HCl in H2O), or perhaps other strong acids. Alternatively, maybe a buffered solution with something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. There's another possibility: the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can also be done with a strong acid like concentrated H2SO4, but in this case, the options don't have H2SO4. Looking again, the options have B as HCl or CH3COOH.

Another thought: the second reaction is in H2O. So for the nitrile hydrolysis, the conditions should be acidic. So for that, using HCl (HCl in water) would be a strong acid, which would drive the hydrolysis to completion. Alternatively, if B is HCl, then that would make sense.

Wait, but sometimes when doing hydrolysis, you might need to acidify the solution. So if the reaction is in water, the reagent B could be HCl to create the acidic conditions necessary for the hydrolysis.

Let's recap the first reaction. It's a ketone reacting with NaCN and A. So A must be an acid catalyst, probably H3O+ or something else. So in the options, A is either H3O+ (options A, B) or NaHSO3 (options C, D). Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate. It's a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, do you need H3O+ or can another acid work? I think H3O+ is a typical choice because it's a strong acid. But NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, but maybe still can act as an acid catalyst. So in the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, would that work? Or is H3O+ more appropriate?

I think for the formation of cyanohydrin, the usual reagent is an aqueous solution of NaCN with a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl. For example, in the lab, the preparation of cyanohydrins often uses H2SO4 as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes a solution of KCN in H2SO4.

Wait, but in the problem, reagent A is given as either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So which would be better for this reaction?

H3O+ is a strong acid, which would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, but I'm not sure if it's strong enough. So if A is H3O+, then the first part uses that.

So for the first reaction, A = H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now the second part, reagent B for the nitrile hydrolysis. The options for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D).

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So if the hydrolysis of nitrile to acid requires strong acid conditions, then using CH3COOH (a weak acid) might not be sufficient. HCl is a strong acid, so that would drive the hydrolysis. So for the second reaction, B should be HCl.

So looking at the options, the first part is H3O+ (so A or B), and the second part is HCl (so A or C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → matches both.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → second part would be weak acid, may not work.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → first part may not work if acid needed is H3O+.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → both seem less appropriate.

So the correct option should be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but I should double-check. What if the first step uses NaHSO3 instead of H3O+? Let me think. NaHSO3 in aqueous solution would provide H+ and SO3^2-. The H+ would help in protonating the carbonyl, so maybe it can also act as an acid catalyst. So could NaHSO3 work as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation?

I think H2SO4
