Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, that might be a typo or unclear. Oh wait, maybe the interaction term is more like L = -λ ψ̄ (y) ψ(y) (v + X(y)), but perhaps the exact form isn't essential for the decay question. The key part is that X is a boson that interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decay modes of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, first, what determines whether a decay is kinematically allowed? Well, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. So, for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, I need to know the masses of all the fermions. Let me recall. Fermions include quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t), leptons (e, mu, tau, neutrinos). But neutrinos are very light, almost massless, so their masses can be neglected. So, for each pair, I have to consider the mass of the fermion times two (since it's a pair).

Wait, but for quarks, the masses are a bit tricky because they're confined, but for decay purposes, we consider their current masses. Let me think:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy, since X is 6 GeV)
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible

So, possible decay products would be pairs where the sum is less than 6 GeV.

Let me list all possible fermion pairs and check their masses:

1. b b-bar: 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less. So decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So any option that includes b bar b is wrong. Looking at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar. Option D includes it too. So those two are out because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV needed.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 4.5 GeV per b quark. So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so 6 <9, so X cannot decay into b and anti-b. So any option with b b-bar is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

A) Includes b b-bar. So A is out.

B) Doesn't include b b-bar, so that's possible.

C) Includes b b-bar? Let me check: C's options are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, no, t t-bar would be 2*173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So C includes t t-bar, which is impossible. So C is out.

D) Includes b b-bar, so D is out.

So now between options B and the others, but actually, wait, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Option C: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, so in the problem statement, the options don't list all possible fermion pairs but only those that are possible.

So from the above, any decay into a pair heavier than 6 GeV is disallowed.

So which fermions have mass sum below 6 GeV?

Let's list all possible pairs:

u anti-u: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV → allowed.

d anti-d: 2 *5 MeV = 10 MeV → allowed.

s anti-s: 2 * 100 MeV = 200 MeV → allowed.

c anti-c: 2 *1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → allowed.

tau anti-tau: 2 *1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed.

e anti-e: 2 *0.5 MeV → allowed.

mu anti-mu: 2 *105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV → allowed.

What about others?

b anti-b: 4.5 *2=9 GeV → X is 6 GeV, not allowed.

t anti-t: way too heavy.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, tau tau-bar, e e-bar, mu mu-bar.

Wait, but wait. The question says, what are the kinematically allowed decays. So any of these fermion pairs can be decay products as long as their combined mass is ≤ 6 GeV.

So the possible decays are into any of these pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-, mu mu-, e e-.

So, that's all the allowed ones except for maybe t t-bar and b b-bar, which are excluded.

Wait, what about neutrinos? The interaction term given includes fermions, but perhaps the Lagrangian is for charged fermions only? Because if the interaction term is ψ, which is a spinor field, perhaps it's for Dirac fermions, which include charged leptons and quarks. But neutrinos are leptons but are usually left-handed and may not be included in the Dirac equation as charged. Hmm, but the problem states the interaction is given, so perhaps the X boson can decay into any of the charged fermions mentioned.

But in any case, the options don't include neutrinos because their mass is negligible, but even so, X can't decay into neutrinos because each neutrino is nearly massless, but you can't have a pair without their antiparticles. Wait, but for a real decay, you need to have a pair, but neutrinos may have negligible mass but are still considered in their own terms.

Wait, no, the decay would produce a pair like ν and anti-ν, but their combined mass would be negligible, but I don't see any of the options including neutrinos. So perhaps the X can decay into any of the allowed pairs I listed earlier.

So which option lists all possible allowed decays? Let's check the options.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So that's all the allowed pairs except for the ones that are too heavy. So option B includes all the allowed pairs except for the b and top quarks.

Wait, but wait. What about the tau? Tau has a mass of about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would sum to 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So option B has all the allowed pairs except for the b and top quarks, which are too heavy.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option A includes b b-bar, which is impossible. So option A is wrong.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible, so option C is wrong.

Option D includes b b-bar, so also wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we must ensure that the total mass of the decay products does not exceed 6 GeV. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs, and their combined rest masses must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Fermion Masses (approximately):
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded due to very high mass)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Neutrinos: Negligible mass (not relevant here)

### Allowed Decays:
1. \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{MeV} = 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
2. \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2 \times 5 \, \text{MeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
3. \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2 \times 100 \, \text{MeV} = 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
4. \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2 \times 1.5 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
5. \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2 \times 1.78 \, \text{GeV} = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
6. \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2 \times 0.5 \, \text{MeV} = 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
7. \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2 \times 105.7 \, \text{MeV} = 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)

### Disallowed Decays:
1. \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2 \times 4.5 \, \text{GeV} = 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (exceeds 6 GeV, not allowed)
2. \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2 \times 173 \, \text{GeV} = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (exceeds 6 GeV, not allowed)

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is disallowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is disallowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is disallowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
