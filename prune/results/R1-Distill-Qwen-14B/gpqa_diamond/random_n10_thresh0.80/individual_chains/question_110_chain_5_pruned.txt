Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different capabilities. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the key points of the question. The question is asking which stars can be observed by both spectrographs. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES should be able to detect them. The options are A to D, each pairing two stars.

From the question, I know the brightness limits for each instrument. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag". Oh wait, no, when a star's magnitude is brighter, it's a smaller number. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17. Wait, no, wait—no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can detect it. Because higher numbers mean fainter. So if a star's apparent V is brighter (like 16), it's within ESPRESSO's limit. But if it's 17.5, it's too faint.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16. So that's a higher brightness requirement than ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be <=16 (since HIRES is brighter limit) and <=17 (which is less strict). So the more restrictive condition is <=16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be V <=16.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the question says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed." So brighter than 17 is V <17. Similarly, "brighter than 16" for HIRES. Wait, no: wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V brighter than 17 can be observed. So if the V is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, stars brighter than
