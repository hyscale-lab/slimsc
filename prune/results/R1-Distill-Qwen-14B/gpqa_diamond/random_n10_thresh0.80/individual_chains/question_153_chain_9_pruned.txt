Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question has three different reactions, A, B, and C, each with their own reactants and products. Then, there are four options (A to D) each giving possible products for A, B, and C. I need to figure out which option correctly matches all the products.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (enone). It's a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. The reaction is typically done under basic conditions, like with a base such as NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in ethanol. 

So, let's look at each part one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A**

Dimethyl malonate is a diester, right? Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2, and it's a good nucleophile because the enolate can form easily. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCO2Me, but wait, no, the substituents here are at 3-position. So, it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Actually, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH(C6H4-4Me)CO2Me? No, wait. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO2Me. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon, but wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the 3 position would be the CH2, the CH, and the COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(C(p-tolyl))CO2Me. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Let me think again: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have
