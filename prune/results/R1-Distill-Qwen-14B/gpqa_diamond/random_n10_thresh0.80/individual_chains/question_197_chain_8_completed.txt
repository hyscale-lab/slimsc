Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I should analyze the spectral data provided. Let's start with the IR.

IR data: 
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests the presence of either an alcohol or possibly an amine, but considering the other peaks, maybe an alcohol. Alternatively, this could be due to O-H or N-H stretching. But the other peaks might help clarify.
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But since there's another peak around 1610, which is often around where conjugated carbonyls or aromatic C=C stretches appear.
- 1610 cm-1: This is in the range for aromatic rings (C=C stretching) and maybe conjugated carbonyls. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.
- 1450 cm-1: This could be due to C-O stretching in an ester or ether, or possibly C=C in a conjugated diene, but more likely something else. Maybe it's part of the aromatic ring's bending or another functional group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an acidic proton, possibly from a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or maybe an aldehyde proton. But carboxylic acids typically have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): In aromatic regions, a doublet for two protons. This suggests perhaps a substituent on a benzene ring causing splitting. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons would be two doublets if there's substitution in the para position.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but at a lower shift. That would fit with a para-substituted benzene where there are two sets of doublets. So maybe it's a 4-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, but wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent.

Wait, if the aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating for 2H, that suggests a di-substituted benzene, with substituents in the para positions. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, one at position 4 and another, but wait, maybe it's a mono-substituted with two types of protons. Hmm, perhaps a more complex substitution.

Looking at the rest of the NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, probably from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe part of a carbonyl group's adjacent CH, like a ketone, or an ester.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps from CH2 groups, maybe in an ethyl chain or part of a larger substituent.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet? No, wait, the splitting is given as a doublet. So a doublet integrating for 3H. This is likely a methyl group attached to another CH group, such as in an isopropyl or isobutyl group. For example, in an isopropyl group, the CH would split the methyl into a doublet.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group, part of an ethyl or longer chain. Like an ethyl group attached to something else.

Putting the NMR together: There's a benzoic acid (from the 10.5 ppm peak), a para-substituted ring (the two doublets in aromatic region), and a substituent that includes a branching. Let's think about the substituent.

The substituent may have a structure like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps a chain with a branching. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be a CH between two sets of CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a sec-butyl group. Let me see: 

So, the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position which is something like a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)—maybe that's the methyl attached to a CH, so like in an isopropyl group. Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The H at 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. If the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2- group, but that might not fit the branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH. Let's think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, so a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent might be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Because a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the substituent. The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal CH3, so that would be from an ethyl group. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a -CH2- group, perhaps next to another CH2. And the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't really support that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group attached to a CH. Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is CH2CH(CH2CH3), making it a 3-methylbutyl group or something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that would give a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me try to map the protons:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be the terminal methyl of an ethyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH that's attached to the benzene ring. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to that CH. Wait, that makes sense for a structure like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-... Hmm, perhaps a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group. Let's consider the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Wait, let's think about the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that would make it a iso-propyl group attached to another CH2. Let me think about the possible structure.

Let me try to reconstruct the substituent based on the NMR peaks:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) → terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) → probably adjacent to the CH2 group.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) → a CH group connected to other groups.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) → a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group.

So perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, no. Let's try to sketch it.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring, then the structure would be benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But wait, that would be a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a iso-propyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular structure. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. But the NMR doesn't show any other carbonyl protons, unless it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is probably the -COOH proton.

So compound X is likely a benzoic acid derivative. So the benzene ring has a -COOH group and another substituent.

So the NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (COOH, 1H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, para-substituted. So the ring is substituted in the para position with another group besides the COOH.

Wait, but wait. If the ring has two substituents: one at position 1 (say, COOH) and another at position 4 (another group), then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (meta to the substituents), or ortho and para. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong.

Alternatively, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. So the COOH is at position 1, and the other substituent at position 4, making the ring para-substituted with two groups.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) relative to the substituents. So each substituent would cause the neighboring protons to split into doublets. So for the COOH group at position 1, the protons at 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear as two doublets. Similarly, the substituent at position 4 would have protons at 3 and 5, which would be another set of doublets, but perhaps with a different chemical shift.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, each integrating for 2H. So maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, causing the aromatic protons to split into two sets of doublets. For example, if the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions, but that's meta, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have two substituents in para positions. Let me draw that:

Positions 1: COOH, position 4: substituent R. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. But in that case, positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and para to substituent R. Positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to substituent R.

Wait, but that might lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps substituent R is at position 4, making the ring have substituents at 1 and 4. Then the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and meta to substituent R. The protons at 3 and 5 would be ortho to substituent R and meta to COOH.

But that would mean that each of these sets of protons would have different chemical shifts and coupling, leading to more than two doublets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about what would cause two doublets each integrating for 2H.

If the ring has one substituent, say at position 4, then the protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, each with different shifts. But perhaps in this case, the substituent at position 4 is such that the ring protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent (due to symmetry), and the protons at 3 and 5 are another set of equivalent protons. So for example, if the substituent is in position 4 and is a strong electron-withdrawing group, the 2 and 6 protons would be deshielded and appear as a doublet, while the 3 and 5 protons would be more shielded and appear as another doublet.

But wait, in that case, the substituent at 4 would be such that the ring is para-substituted. So perhaps the ring has a substituent at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but that would make the ring have two substituents: COOH at 1 and R at 4.

In that scenario, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6.

If the substituent R is a strong electron-withdrawing group (like a nitro group), the protons at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded and appear downfield, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be more shielded and appear upfield. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets: one at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and another at 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests that each pair of protons is a doublet. So perhaps the substituent R is such that it's causing the 2 and 6 protons to be a doublet (higher shift) and the 3 and 5 to be another doublet (lower shift).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, but the ring is such that the two substituents are in para positions. So R is in position 4, COOH in position 1, and the ring has symmetry so that the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent.

Wait, that would make sense. So the ring has two substituents: COOH at 1 and R at 4. This would make the ring structure symmetric along the axis passing through positions 1 and 4. Therefore, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be another set of equivalent protons.

So, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would correspond to the protons at 2 and 6, which are ortho to COOH and para to R. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would correspond to the protons at 3 and 5, which are meta to COOH and ortho to R.

Now, the substituent R: what would that be? Let's consider the NMR data.

Looking at the non-aromatic peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or another electronegative group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps CH2 groups adjacent to a branching point.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

This seems to suggest a structure where R is a substituent attached via a CH group, which is connected to a CH2 group, then another CH2, and ending with a CH3. But wait, let me think about the substituent R.

Wait, the substituent R is attached to the benzene ring through a CH group. That CH is then connected to another CH2 (from 1.7 ppm), which in turn is connected to a CH group that has a methyl (1.4 ppm, d) and another ethyl chain (0.9 ppm, t).

Hmm, perhaps the substituent R is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps R is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? No, that would be a pentyl group, but the NMR data doesn't fit that.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. A sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I should think more clearly.

Wait, a butyl group has four carbons. The structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that's actually a neopentyl or something else. Wait, no. Let me think, for a butyl group:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a straight chain).

- iso-butyl (or 2-methylpropyl): CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent we're looking at in the NMR has a structure that would give these peaks. Let me try to sketch it:

The substituent R is at position 4 on the benzene ring. It's connected via a CH group (from the 2.9 ppm peak). This CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), which is connected to another CH group (perhaps) and then a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and also a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

Wait, that sounds like a structure where R is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but then the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm, which fits. The CH group would be attached to the benzene, then a CH2, then a CH(CH2CH3), but that would give a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that might be a pentyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Let me think differently.

Let me try to think about the substituent as a butyl group, either iso, sec, or n.

If R is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent. Let's see:

The benzene ring is connected to a CH group (the 2.9 ppm peak), which is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), which is connected to another CH group (the 1.4 ppm peak), which is connected to a CH3 (d, 3H), and then another CH2 (with a terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm, t, 3H). Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think, that would give:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene (2.9 ppm, 1H: perhaps that's the central CH group in the substituent).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that would give a structure where the CH2 is attached to the benzene, then a CH with a CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an iso-propyl group attached via a CH2. But that would give a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, but then the NMR might not match.

Wait, another approach: Let's sum up the possible structure.

Compound X has a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a substituent R in the para position. The substituent R is connected via a CH group to the ring. The CH group has neighboring groups which include a CH2 group (1.7 ppm), a methyl group attached as a doublet (1.4 ppm), and a terminal methyl as a triplet (0.9 ppm).

So the substituent R is probably a propyl group with a branch. The structure could be:

Benzene ring: COOH at position 1, R at position 4.

R is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe R is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring, giving the 2.9 ppm peak (the CH2 would be split into a triplet, but in the NMR it's a multiplet). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of R as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, attached to the ring. Then:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (the CH between the ring and CH(CH3)) would have protons that are split into a multiplet. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a singlet? No, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH would be attached to the ring. The CH2 groups would give the 1.7 and 0.9 ppm signals.

Wait, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to a CH2. That is, R is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be: benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3). Then, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

Let me see:

- The CH2 connected to the ring (the first CH2) would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, not 2H. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a tertiary butyl group. But wait, that would have a (CH3)3C- group, which would give a singlet for the methyl groups, but in the NMR, the methyl groups are split into doublets and triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the substituent's NMR.

The substituent's NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)

Then, the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, but let me think of the structure as:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

No, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-pentyl group. Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's longer than needed.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

In this case, the CH2 attached to the ring (the first CH2) would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't match. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to the ring, with a CH2CH2CH3 group. But that would mean the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, so the structure would be:

Ring-CH(CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but then the CH would have two CH2 groups attached. Let me think about the NMR.

The CH group would be split into a multiplet (2.9 ppm, m, 1H). The next CH2 would be attached to the CH, giving the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Then, that CH2 is connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a four-carbon chain, making it a pentyl group, which seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would be a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. So if the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group, that wouldn't fit because the CH3 would be attached to the central CH, but the chain would be longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the structure would be:

Ring-CH(CH2CH3)

So the substituent is an iso-propyl group attached to the ring. Then, the CH group would be the 2.9 ppm peak (1H), the CH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm (but in the NMR, it's a doublet). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the substituent is a -C(CH3)2CH2- group, but that would give a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but again, I'm not matching the data.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would be a iso-butyl group.

Wait, an iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But wait, the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)2.

So if the substituent is an iso-butyl group, then the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the substituent is an iso-butyl group. Let's see how that would match the NMR.

The iso-butyl group would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (from the iso-butyl group) would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. What if the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure is:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

In this case, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group? Or perhaps a 2-methylpropyl group.

Wait, in that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (the first CH2): would have two protons, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a single H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, making it a pentyl group with a branch. No, I'm not getting this right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. Hmm, but the NMR doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think about the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, Clemmensen uses HCl with Zn and Hg, not HI. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, that's not right.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI might be used in the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, this reaction could be a substitution.

Wait, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the elimination of HX from a vicinal dihalide to form an alkene, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, or perhaps it's a Halogenation reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid from an ester. No, but the starting material is the acid.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group. Wait, in the IR, the carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. But if X has a carbonyl, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might reduce it.

Wait, Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. But if X is a ketone, then the product would be an alkane. But looking at the options, the product options are all benzenes with substituents, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if X is a benzoic acid, reacting with HI might do something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by HI. For example, if X has a tosylate or mesylate group, but I don't see evidence for that in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid from a nitrile, but I don't see nitrile peaks in the IR.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is formed via elimination. For example, if X has a structure that upon treatment with HI would undergo an elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the starting material would be an ester, but the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm).

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the decarboxylation of a benzoic acid, but that typically requires heating and a base, not HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the IR and NMR again.

IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely an ester or a ketone. But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which suggests a carboxylic acid. That's conflicting because a carboxylic acid's carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but the 10.5 ppm is the O-H stretch. Wait, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad and around 10 ppm, and the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. So the 1720 cm-1 peak could be an ester or ketone. But if the compound is a benzoic acid, that would explain the 10.5 ppm peak. Then, perhaps the carbonyl at 1720 is an ester or another carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe X is a benzoyl ester. For example, something like a methyl benzoate would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. But the NMR would show an OCH3 group. But in the NMR data provided, I don't see any singlet around 3.8 ppm, which would be typical for an OCH3. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde. The carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, but the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. However, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more downfield than an aldehyde. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the compound is a ketone, but the 10.5 ppm peak is something else. But that doesn't make sense because 10.5 ppm is more typical for a carboxylic acid.

So perhaps X is a benzoic acid with an ester group? No, that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, maybe X is a substituted benzoic acid with an ester substituent, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the IR is showing a carbonyl from an ester, and the NMR is a benzoic acid. But that would require X to have both a carboxylic acid and an ester group, which is possible but less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think of the structure again.

If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's an ethyl group, then the substituent would be a -CH2CH2- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be a tert-butyl group. Then, the substituent would be a tert-butyl group attached to the ring. The NMR would show a singlet for the 9 H in the tert-butyl, but that's not what's observed. So that's not it.

Another approach: Let's look at the options and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the product would be one of these. So, if X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which product would form.

Wait, but first, I need to figure out what X is.

Assuming X is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think about the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

The NMR would show:

- A broad peak for the COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm.

- Aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating for 2H, because the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), making the ring para-substituted.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

The substituent (sec-butyl) is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

So, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (the central CH in the substituent) would have a peak around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2-CH(CH3)) would split into a multiplet around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH(CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm doublet for the methyl (3H), as it's attached to the CH.

- The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet (3H).

Wait, that matches the NMR data perfectly.

So, putting it together, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, what's the reaction with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, or perhaps in the formation of alkenes via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a common reaction is the substitution of a leaving group. For example, if X has a halogen, like a bromide, it could be replaced by HI, but in this case, X doesn't seem to have a halide.

Wait, another possibility: If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Wait, but Clemmensen reduction uses HCl, Zn, and Hg to reduce ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, which uses ammonia and a metal, but that's not likely here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but again, I don't see a nitrile in X.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But the NMR suggests X is already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to cleave double bonds via hydrohalogenation, but that might not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg, not red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible product from the reaction. The options are all substituted benzenes, either with an acid group or not.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI might lead to the substitution of the -COOH group with something else.

Wait, but how? Red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for such substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Wait, the COOH group could be reduced to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is converted into a methyl ester, but the reagents don't suggest that.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: a benzoic acid with an ethyl substituent in the para position.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl substituents, but that's more of a di-substituted benzene.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: the same as option C, so not the product.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: a di-substituted benzene with sec-butyl and methyl groups.

Wait, but X is the starting material, which is C if option C is correct. So the reaction would take X (C) and produce another compound.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me re-express: The question says X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So the product is one of the options, which are all different from X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by something else. But I don't know what would replace the acid group with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's done with PCl5, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and methyl in the para positions. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl group on the benzene ring.

How would X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) react to form this?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a CH2 group. For example, decarboxylation followed by hydrogenation. But I'm not sure how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid group to an alkyl group via some mechanism.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride followed by a substitution. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, leading to the formation of a methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the possible product.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the product could be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not one of the options. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is the same as 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. Hmm, that would require both substituents to be in the para position, but that's not possible unless it's a meta-substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid to form an acid chloride, which then undergoes a substitution, but I don't see how that would lead to the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to a benzyl group. Wait, but that's done via catalytic hydrogenation, not with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that doesn't apply here because X is already an acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but that doesn't seem relevant.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an -OH group, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but without Mg, that's unlikely.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible product options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which matches the description of X. So if X is option C, then the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by -I, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, but X isn't an ester.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a hydrogen. But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride, but that would require something like PCl5.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave alkenes via hydrohalogenation, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps X has a leaving group, like a bromide, which is replaced by HI.

Wait, but X's structure as determined earlier doesn't include a bromide or other leaving group. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the addition of HI across a carbonyl group, like in an acid-catalyzed addition. But in X, the carbonyl is part of the benzoic acid, which isn't typically reactive in that way.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but again, without Mg, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a nitro group, but X doesn't have one.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of this differently. The IR and NMR data point to X being a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a sec-butyl group.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But here, X is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, but that's done with something like LiAlH4, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is the elimination of water from an ester to form an alkene. But X isn't an ester.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't a substitution but something else. Let's think about the product options again.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. Alternatively, position 4 is the same as position 1 in a para substitution. Wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so 1 and 4 are the same in the para position.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene where both substituents are in the para positions, but one is a methyl and the other is a sec-butyl.

But how would X (a benzoic acid) become a di-substituted benzene without the acid group?

Ah, wait a minute. The reaction could be decarboxylation and then substitution. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a methyl group. For example, if the -COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, then the product would have a methyl in the para position along with the substituent.

Wait, that would make sense. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the -COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, making it 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

But wait, how would the -COOH group be converted to a methyl group?

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the replacement of the carboxylic acid group with a methyl group. That would require a substitution, but under what conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a methyl ester, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about known reactions with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But X isn't a nitrile, it's a carboxylic acid.

Another possibility: Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. For example, in the presence of HI, it might reduce a carbonyl group. But X's carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methylene group. For example, if the -COOH is converted to -CH2-, which would require a two-electron reduction.

Wait, but how would that happen? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but again, that's not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction in terms of the product options.

If X is a benzoic acid, and the product is a benzene with substituents, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the acid group, leaving a hydrogen in its place, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -COOH group with a -I, but that's not one of the product options.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me recap.

X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. The product is one of the options.

Looking at the options, the only one that makes sense after elimination of the acid group would be a benzene with substituents. So perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the acid group to a methyl group, leading to option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But how would that happen? Maybe the acid group is reduced to a methyl group. Reduction of a carboxylic acid to a methyl group typically requires strong reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) under certain conditions, but not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide, followed by a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the elimination of CO2, converting the carboxylic acid into a methyl group. But I don't know the exact mechanism for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with substituents derived from X's structure, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The correct answer is likely option C, but wait, the question asks for the product after reaction. So if X is option C, the product must be another compound.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but X is already an acid.

I'm not making progress on the reaction part, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another possibility: The reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a benzyl group. For example, if the -COOH is converted to a CH2 group, but I don't know the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced with an -OCH3 group, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've invested, I'll proceed to make a conclusion based on the spectral data.

The NMR and IR data indicate that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the product is likely option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But wait, how? I'm not certain, but perhaps the reaction replaces the -COOH group with a -CH3 group via some substitution or reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the elimination of the -COOH group, leading to a CH3 group in its place. So the product would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and methyl group in the para positions, which is option D.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of X.

### IR and NMR Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Indicate aromatic C=C stretching, consistent with a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

From this data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The structure includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)) at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in reactions involving halogenation, substitution, or reduction. In this case, the reaction likely converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH₃). This results in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, where the benzene ring has a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the reaction does not retain the carboxylic acid group.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as the substituents do not match the structure of X.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the structure of Compound X, not the product.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct, as it is the product formed after the reaction.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D
