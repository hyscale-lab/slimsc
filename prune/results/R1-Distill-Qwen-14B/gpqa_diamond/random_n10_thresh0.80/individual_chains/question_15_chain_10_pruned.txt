Okay, so I've got this question about detecting planets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. So Planet_1 is orbiting closer.

They both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but how does star mass affect the probability of transit?

I remember that the transit probability (P) is given by the formula: P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1/(R_s + R_p)^2)) where R_p is planet radius, a is semi-major axis, R_s is star radius. Wait, another approach I've heard is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's distance from us (or the observer's perspective) but wait, no, that's not it. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(something else? Or maybe not. Oh wait, I think the actual formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_s) / (a_p) )^2 )? No, I'm confusing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the geometry. The probability is about how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula I've heard is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_s - a_p) / a_p ), but that might not be right. Alternatively, the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (R_s + R_p) )^2 ? Hmm, maybe I should look up the correct formula but since I can't, I'll think through.

Wait, the probability of transit can be approximated as the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet can transit compared to the area
