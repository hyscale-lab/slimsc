Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, how does that translate into a geometrical position?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out more explicitly. The |0⟩⟨0| term is a 2x2 matrix with a 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, the |1⟩⟨1| term has a 1 in the (2,2) position. So adding them together, each of the diagonal elements becomes 1, and then we multiply by 1/2. So ρ would be a diagonal matrix with entries [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

Now, I remember that a single qubit state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of these coordinates. The general form for a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector (r) is something like (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So the general expression is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2. So expanding that, the density matrix would have elements:

For the top-left (0,0) element: (1 + r_z)/2, because X and Y contribute off-diagonal terms, but Z affects the diagonal.

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when you compute r·σ, you're doing r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So the matrix (I + r·σ)/2 becomes:

(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
           [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Wait, because σ_x contributes to the off-diagonal elements, σ_y contributes as well with the imaginary unit. So putting it all together, the density matrix ρ has elements:

ρ_00 = (1 + r_z)/2
ρ_01 = (r_x - i r_y)/2
ρ_10 = (r_x + i r_y)/2
ρ_11 = (1 - r_z)/2

So for the given ρ, we have ρ_00 = 1/2 and ρ_11 = 1/2. Also, the off-diagonal elements are zero because the given ρ has no off-diagonal terms.

So looking at ρ_01, which is (r_x - i r_y)/2. In our case, ρ_01 is
