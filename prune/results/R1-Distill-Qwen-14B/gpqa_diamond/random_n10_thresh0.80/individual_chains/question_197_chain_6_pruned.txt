Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound. 

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR first. 

IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1.

Hmm, the broad peak between 3400 and 2500 probably indicates an -OH group because that's usually where O-H stretches appear. But wait, sometimes that can also be an NH stretch, but from the NMR, I'll get more clues. 

The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator. That's usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if there's an -OH nearby, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have a strong carbonyl (around 1700 cm-1) and an -OH which would show a broad peak. Alternatively, an ester might have a carbonyl around 1720. But let me think about the other peaks. 

The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring. 

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let me list the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – a broad singlet. That's likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. Alternatively, an alcohol would also show up here, but the IR suggests a carbonyl, which would fit better with a carboxylic acid. 

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton has one equivalent neighbor. 

7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, also a doublet. This matches with a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe with two substituents. Wait, no, if the ring is mono-substituted, the coupling might be different. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring in a para arrangement. 

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic region is split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted di-substituted benzene. Maybe two substituents in the para positions. Wait, wait, no. Because in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would split the aromatic protons into two sets of doublets. Alternatively, it could be a single substituent with two adjacent protons. Hmm, maybe it's a single substituent, making the ring have two sets of protons. Let me think: if the substituent is in the para position, the ring would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon. Wait, perhaps it's a meta substitution? No, because the coupling in the NMR would show different patterns. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position and has two groups attached. 

Wait, let's think of the structure. If we have a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other. For example, in 1,3 positions (meta), but that would cause different splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me look at the other NMR signals.
