Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that's interesting. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. I remember that 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the melting point of water (which is 0°C or 273 K). Wait, but B's melting point is close to that, so maybe B is something like water or ice? Or maybe another compound with a similar melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C.

Looking at the other part: the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product has two O atoms. Keto acid—okay, a keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, no, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group elsewhere in the molecule. But when it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the reaction is something like decarboxylation? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack where the acid donates an oxygen?

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Wait, the problem specifies that X incorporates a heavier isotope. Oh, and also, X's analog is used as a reagent, so maybe X is something like a halogen, like bromine, which has a heavy isotope, or maybe something else.

Looking at the reaction: X and Y react violently to produce gas W, precipitate G, and release B upon heating G. Let me think about some violent reactions. Maybe a metal reacting with an acid? For example, sodium reacting with water, but that's a violent reaction. But wait, sodium is a metal, but what would that produce? Sodium would react with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But the gas W here is supposed to have equal protons and neutrons. Hydrogen gas (H2) has one proton each, so each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1^1H typically). So that wouldn't fit because the number of neutrons is 0, which is less than protons. So maybe another gas?

Wait, another possibility is that gas W is carbon dioxide. CO2 has protons: 12 (from C) + 16*2 (from O) = 12 +32=44. Neutrons: the molecular weight is 44, but each atom contributes its own. Wait, but W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think. Let’s suppose W is an isotope of a molecule. For example, CO2 would have 12C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and O16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each O16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for CO2, total protons:6 + 8*2=22. Neutrons:6 +8*2=22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, same number. So that fits. So W is CO2.

Wait, but why would X reacting with Y produce CO2? That suggests maybe the reaction involves a carbonate or something that would release CO2 upon decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid and X is a carbonate. Wait, but the precipitate G when heated gives B. Let me think about the sequence.

So X reacts with Y to give W (CO2), G (precipitate), and possibly another product. Then when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating would give calcium oxide and CO2. But wait, in that case, B would be CO2 again, but that's not right because B is the product after heating G. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide that decomposes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is water. If X is a carbonate, then X reacting with Y (water) would give CO2, but that doesn't fit because carbonate reacting with water doesn't produce a precipitate. Alternatively, X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid (like HCl). For example, say X is sodium carbonate, Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and water. But that's a solution, not a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid. Let's think about metals reacting with water. For instance, sodium reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But earlier I thought H2 doesn't fit because of the neutron count. Unless gas W is something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe gas W is CH4. Methane has 4 hydrogens (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons in C12). So CH4 has 10 protons and 6 neutrons (from C) plus 4 H's, so 10 +4 =14 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 0 (from H) =6. So 14 vs 6—not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, what about CO (carbon monoxide)? CO has 6 + 8 =14 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 8 (from O) =14. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. So W could be CO. But I'm not sure what reaction would produce CO. Alternatively, maybe W is O2. O2 has
