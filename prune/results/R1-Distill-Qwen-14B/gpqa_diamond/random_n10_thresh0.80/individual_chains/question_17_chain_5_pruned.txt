Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They say the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the concentration of the complex and the stability constant, K. I think I need to relate the concentration of the calcium ions to this.

Wait, the stability constant, or formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K for this reaction is 5e10.

Stoichiometric ratio is important here. Since it's a 1:1 complex, each mole of Ca-EDTA complex corresponds to one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA.

But wait, when the EDTA is in solution, not all of it is in the form of free EDTA. Some is bound to Ca²+ as the complex. So to find the free EDTA concentration, I might need to use the K expression.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. I think I can set up an equation using the K expression.

The K expression is K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] )

We can rearrange this to solve for [Ca²+]. So [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−] / ( K * [EDTA⁴-] )

But wait, that seems a bit unclear. Let me think again. Alternatively, if the complex is in solution, the presence of the complex affects the concentrations of the ions.

Wait, another approach: Because the solution is stoichiometric, which I think means that all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, so no excess Ca²+ or EDTA. Wait, or is that the case? No, because the complex dissociates to some extent.

But in a sto
