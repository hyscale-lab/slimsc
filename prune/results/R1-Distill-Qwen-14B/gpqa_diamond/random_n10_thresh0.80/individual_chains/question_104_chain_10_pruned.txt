Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks at the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity causing the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits, so that shouldn't complicate things. The key data is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. Because a planet closer in would make the star move more quickly, leading to a larger shift. Or maybe it's the mass and the orbital period? Hmm.

I recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for K is something like K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) * (1 / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think K is given by K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

Since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_p is the same for both planets, and M_* is the same for both stars. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the (1 - e²) terms are 1. So those parts cancel out.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), because if I rearrange the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me think. The formula for K is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2π)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the formula for the star's velocity:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But since e is zero, and M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so M_* cancels out when considering the ratio between K1 and K2.

In this problem, since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, and the orbits are circular (e=0), so the ratio of K (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends inversely on the cube root of the orbital period.

Wait, but actually, let me get this straight. K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), since a larger orbit (larger a) would result in a smaller K. Because a larger planet orbit would cause the star to move more slowly, giving a smaller Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ]

But again, since e=0 and M_* and M_p are same for both, it's easier to think in terms of the proportionality.

So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Or wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between K and the orbital period P.

Another formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) * ( (P / day )^(-1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the relationship between K and P is such that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because the star's velocity depends on the planet's orbital period; a longer period (larger orbit) would mean a lower velocity for the star, leading to a smaller K.

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, what's their ratio?

Wait, wait. But wait, milliangstrom is a unit of wavelength shift. Oh, wait, no: the radial velocity shift is measured in velocity units (m/s), but the question says the wavelength shift is periodic, up to 5 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The Doppler shift is related to velocity via the formula:

Δλ / λ = v / c

Where Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the original wavelength. So the velocity is v = c * (Δλ / λ )

But for a given spectral line, λ is fixed. So the velocity shift is proportional to Δλ.

So if planet 1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstrom, and planet 2 causes 7, then the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to 5 and 7 respectively.

Wait, no: the shift is proportional to velocity. So K for planet 1 is 5, K for planet 2 is 7.

Wait, but no, wait. Because the star's velocity is what's causing the shift. So K is the velocity. So if K1 is 5 m/s (assuming the units are m/s), and K2 is 7 m/s, then K2 is larger, meaning the star is moving more due to planet 2.

Wait, but the problem says the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So, since the velocity is proportional to the shift (for a given wavelength), then K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. How do K and P relate?

From the radial velocity method, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period P.

Another approach: using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis a.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) * a³

Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_* )) a³

So a³ ∝ P² * M_*

But we also have the radial velocity formula. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/( (P) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the formula as:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the proportionality.

Since K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Because in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets and stars respectively, the
