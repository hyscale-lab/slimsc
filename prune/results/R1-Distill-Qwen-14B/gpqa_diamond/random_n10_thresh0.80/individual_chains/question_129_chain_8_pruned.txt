Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, and some hints, so I need to piece everything together.

First, let me jot down the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four possible structures for E.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

Starting with compound A. From the IR hint, a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O). So compound A is likely a cyclic ketone. Because when I think about carbonyl IR: aldehydes are around 1720, ketones around 1715, but maybe under different circumstances. Wait, but in the question, A's peak is higher, at 1750. Hmm, maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group or something that's more electron-withdrawing, making the C=O stronger. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes are generally higher in wavenumber than ketones. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 1720, ketones around 1700-1750? Or wait, maybe A is an ester or a nitrile? Because nitriles have a strong peak around 2250, which isn't mentioned. So probably not. So maybe A is a cyclic ketone.

But let's think about the reaction of A with HCN. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction between a ketone and HCN would add an -OH-Câ‰¡N group. So, the product B would have an alcohol and a cyanide group attached. Wait, but more accurately, the cyanohydrin formation adds a hydroxyl and a nitrile group across the carbonyl, turning it into a secondary alcohol with a nitrile adjacent.

Wait, so for example, cyclopentanone reacting with HCN would give 3-hydroxycyanocyclopentane or something like that.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's usually a hydrogenation reaction. But what's the functional group in B? Since B is a cyanohydrin, it has an -OH and a -CN group. So, when hydrogenated, the -CN group (nitrile) would get reduced to an amine
