Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch reaction stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think through this.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any neutrinos produced in the pp-III reactions would have been reaching Earth before this, but if the reaction stops, the new neutrinos won't be coming from that source anymore. But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, I remember that the solar neutrinos come from different processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain (pp), which has different branches. The pp-I and pp-II branches are lower energy, and the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing the 700-800 keV neutrinos, I think. Because the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 nucleus, which releases a positron and a neutrino. Or was it the other way around? Maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, no, the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain. The main pp reaction is pp-I, which involves two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then, in pp-II, deuterium fuses with a proton to make tritium, and that also emits a neutrino. But wait, the high-energy neutrinos, like the ones around 1 MeV, come from a different process, maybe the CNO cycle? Or another branch.

Wait, no, I think the pp-III branch actually produces higher-energy neutrinos. Let me recall: the pp-III branch is when two helium-3 nuclei (He-3) fuse to form a helium-4 nucleus. But wait, that's not correct because He-3 fusing into He-4 would require more protons, right? Or maybe it's a different process. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch involves a proton and a helium-3 to make a carbon-12 nucleus, which then undergoes further reactions. But that might be part of the CNO cycle, which is more about carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me organize this. The Sun's core is mainly the proton-proton chain. The initial step is two protons (H-1) fusing into deuterium (D), emitting a positron and a neutrino. That's pp-I. Then, deuterium (D) fuses with another proton to form tritium (T), which is pp-II. Then, tritium fuses with another proton to form helium-4 (He-4), emitting another neutrino. So, each of these steps produces a neutrino. But the neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II are lower energy, around 0.5 MeV or so. But there's another branch, the pp-III branch, which involves different pathways.

Oh right! The pp-III branch is when two He-3 nuclei (each being a He-3 ion) fuse to make He-4, releasing two protons and a lot of energy. This process produces high-energy neutrinos because the mass difference is larger, leading to higher kinetic energy in the emitted neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy, typically around 1-2 MeV. Therefore, the band 700-800 keV would be part of the pp-III neutrinos, and the 800-900 keV would be slightly higher, but also in the same range.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The pp-III process produces neutrinos in a specific energy range. If the pp-III branch stops, then the flux of neutrinos from that process would drop. But the question is about the ratio between band 1 (700-800) and band 2 (800-900). If the pp-III is the main source for both of these bands, then stopping it would affect both. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in certain energy bands. If it stops, then any neutrinos in those bands would be from other processes, but I thought that the main solar neutrinos are from the pp chain. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos as well, but I'm not sure about their exact energies.

Wait, the CNO cycle neutrinos are also high-energy, but I think they're at higher energies than pp-III. For example, the CNO neutrinos are in the ~10-15 MeV
