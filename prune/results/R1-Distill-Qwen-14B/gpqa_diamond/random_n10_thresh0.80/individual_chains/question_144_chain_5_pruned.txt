Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance in this context probably refers to a particle with a very short lifetime, which means it decays quickly. But I'm not too sure about the specifics.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson. The given data is the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying. So first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson X.

Wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that Γ * τ ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, the exact formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. Because the natural linewidth is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So I can calculate τ using that.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. But I need to find the velocity of the meson.

Hmm, how do I get the velocity? The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, so I can calculate its velocity using relativistic equations. The mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. Wait, but the units here are a mix of GeV and MeV. I need to make sure to convert them correctly.

So first, let's get all the units in terms of consistent units, probably using SI units. Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the velocity v of the meson.
2. Calculate the lifetime τ from Γ.
3. Multiply v and τ to get the mean decay distance L.

Let me tackle each step.

Starting with the velocity. The meson's energy is given as E_X =8 GeV. The mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. Wait, but in particle physics, the energy is often given in terms of the rest mass. So E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the meson is a resonance, so maybe it's moving relativistically. So to find the velocity, I can use the relation between energy and momentum, and then find beta (v/c).

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma m c², and the momentum p = gamma m v. So v = (p c²)/(E). Alternatively, since E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute beta = v/c. Beta can be found from beta = p c / E, because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So p
