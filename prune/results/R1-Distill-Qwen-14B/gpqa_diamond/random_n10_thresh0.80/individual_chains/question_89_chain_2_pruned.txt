Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part involves 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. This is probably dehydrohalogenation via an E2 mechanism. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH would likely give me an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, product 1.

Looking at the ¹H NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, if the reaction is an elimination, shouldn't product 1 be an alkene? But then why is there a carbonyl peak?

Hmm. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. When vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, they typically eliminate to form an alkene. But wait, wait—wait, KOH in what phase? If it's alcoholic KOH, it's elimination. But if it's aqueous, maybe it's a substitution. But given that it's heated, elimination is more likely. So, why the IR has a carbonyl? Oh! Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Oh wait, wait. Oh, wait a minute—if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH in a different condition—maybe elimination of HBr twice, but that would form a diene? No, wait. Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction? If KOH is in aqueous solution, it's SN2, but for adamantane derivatives, which are generally rigid and have high ring strain? Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. The dihalide is on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So perhaps when treated with KOH, it undergoes elimination. But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone?

Wait, that doesn't fit with elimination. Maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! Wait, could it be a ring-opening? No, adamantane is very stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but that would produce an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's an example where two HBr molecules are eliminated, but that would leave a double bond. But then why the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How? If elimination isn't forming a double bond, but maybe a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms double bonds, not carbonyls. Unless there's some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is forming an epoxide. No, that would require an oxygen source, but KOH is a base. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an ether, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let
