Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. This ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Ã…, and LTE is assumed.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of atoms in different energy levels changes with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is proportional to the exponential term, assuming g2/g1 is constant. So if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means the exponential term is lower when the star is cooler (since spots make the overall Teff lower). Because when the spots are present, the overall temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K.

Wait, but wait. The question says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is lower, and the ratio (n1/n2) increases, or wait, the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, no. Let me read again: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, or (n2/n1) increases? Wait, the ratio is (n1/n2) or (n2/n1)?

The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. So it's (n_level1) / (n_level2) = ratio. And this ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, (n1)/(n2) is smaller. So when the star doesn't have spots, (n1/n2) is higher, and when it does, it's lower.

So when the temperature is lower, the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller. So what about the Boltzmann factor?

Remember, the ratio (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 is higher than E1, when T increases, the exponential term becomes larger because (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the negative is larger, and exp of a
