Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says and how I can approach it.

The problem is about a reaction scheme leading to compound E. There are multiple steps, and I need to identify compound E from the options given. Also, there are some hints that might help me deduce the structures.

First, I'll outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is strong around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each step and the information I can gather.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B.
HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. But given that after adding HCN, we get B, which is then reduced. So maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde. Since the IR of A is at ~1750, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a ketone. Because aldehydes have higher wavenumbers (~2800 for C-H stretch too, but the carbonyl is around 1720-1710). Wait, no, wait. Let me think: I remember that carbonyl absorption for ketones is around 1715 cm^-1, but wait, wait. No, wait! Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Wait, esters have higher carbonyl, like ~1740. Aldehydes are around 1720, ketones a bit lower, like 1715. Wait, or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

- Aldehydes: C=O around 1720 cm^-1.
- Ketones: ~1715 cm^-1.
- Esters: ~1740 cm^-1.
- Carboxylic acids: ~1700 cm^-1.

So the hint says A's IR is ~1750 cm^-1. That's higher than aldehydes and ketones. So maybe A is an ester or a nitrile? Wait, nitriles have C≡N around 2250, but their carbonyl (if any) is... Wait, esters have higher. So if A is an ester, then when it reacts with HCN, would that form something else? Alternatively, maybe A is a methyl ketone? No, wait, methyl ketones have C=O around 1715.

Wait, 1750 is more
