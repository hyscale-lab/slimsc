Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a type of nucleophilic addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C). Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So, in such conditions, I think the base deprotonates the α-carbon of the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the other compound. 

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so when deprotonated, the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that is probably something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent being p-tolyl. Wait, no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2 connected differently. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Not entirely sure, but the important part is that it's an α,β-unsaturated ester, so the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the β position.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β carbon of the acrylate, the nucleophile (the enolate) will add to the less substituted side because of the E-configuration. Wait, no, the E-geometry would have the substituents opposite each other. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So the enolate
