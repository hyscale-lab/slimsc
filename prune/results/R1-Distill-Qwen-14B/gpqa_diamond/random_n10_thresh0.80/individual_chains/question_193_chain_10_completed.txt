Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in arcseconds. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

But wait, the problem states that the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Oh, wait no, the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Or is it the other way around? Let me read that again. It says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Or perhaps N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant.

Wait, maybe I should think about how parallax relates to distance. Since plx = 1/d (in parsecs), so d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So substituting plx in terms of d: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 → which is d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm, so they're asking for the change in N with respect to r. So the change would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it in terms of the number of stars per unit volume or something. Let me think: if N is proportional to d^5, but wait, that can't be right because the number of stars in a volume should depend on the volume, which is r^3. So maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps N is the number of stars in a region. Let me think about it. The number of stars you can see depends on how many are in the line of sight. So maybe the number of stars in a certain region may depend on the volume, which is distance cubed. But according to the problem, N is varying as 1/plx^5, so perhaps there's another factor involved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this more systematically.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/d, then plx = 1/(d) → d = 1/plx.

So substituting into N: N ∝ (d)^5 → because 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that seems to suggest that as d increases (we look further away), the number of stars increases with d^5, which seems way too steep. But maybe the question is considering the distribution in a specific way.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance, per unit range of distance r". So perhaps it's asking how the number of stars per unit distance (like a differential) changes with distance.

So perhaps we need to find dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars per unit distance.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5 * d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4 in the answer. Wait, the options are in terms of r, not d. Let me see the options again.

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

So if d is the distance in parsecs, and the change per unit r is the derivative, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr is proportional to 4π r² dr multiplied by some density.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars as a function of distance. In a typical scenario, the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to the volume, which is 4π r² dr multiplied by some number density (stars per unit volume), which might be a constant. So N ∝ r² dr. But that's the standard case for a uniform distribution.

But in this problem, it's given that N varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the density isn't uniform. Let me re-examine the given.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but if you have a range of distances, like from d to d+Δd, then the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by some density. But in this case, the problem states that N varies as 1/(plx)^5, perhaps meaning that the number of stars in a unit volume at distance d is proportional to d^5. That would be unusual because usually, the number density decreases with distance if stars are not clustered, but perhaps in this problem, it's given.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider the scenario again.

The number of stars in a region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a fixed direction (same direction, but looking at different distances), the number of stars you see at a distance d is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

So when you look at a certain direction, the number of stars you can see in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the area (since it's a region of the sky) multiplied by the volume element along the line of sight, and multiplied by the number density.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a region of the sky at a certain distance d is given by the number density (n) multiplied by the area (A) multiplied by the thickness (dr). So N = n * A * dr.

But according to the problem, N varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So n * A * dr = k * d^5.

Wait, but n could be the number density. Let's suppose that the number density n is constant with distance. Then, n = constant. So N = n A dr.

But that would mean that N is proportional to dr, not d^5. So that can't be right. So perhaps the number density n isn't constant but varies with distance.

Wait, perhaps the number density n is such that n is proportional to d^5. Then, N = n A dr = (k d^5) * A * dr.

Wait, but in that case, for a given direction, the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to d^5 * dr. But the problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, so perhaps N is proportional to d^5. So when you integrate along the line of sight, the total N would be proportional to d^5. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars per unit area (the surface density) varies as 1/plx^5. Because in the sky, the number of stars you observe at a certain distance would depend on the area and the depth. So surface density could be N/(Area * depth), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a given direction is being considered as a function of distance. So for a given direction, the number of stars at distance d is proportional to d^5. So when you look towards a certain part of the sky, the number of stars at that distance increases with d^5. So as you go further away, you see more stars, which is counterintuitive because usually, the number would decrease due to the increasing volume. But perhaps in this problem, the setup is such that more stars are present at larger distances.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with distance is dN/dd = 5 d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r. So if r is the distance, then dN/dr = 5 r^4, so the number of stars per unit distance changes as r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but why would the number of stars increase so rapidly with distance? It's a bit strange, but given the problem's setup, that's what the math suggests. So I think the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we compute the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
