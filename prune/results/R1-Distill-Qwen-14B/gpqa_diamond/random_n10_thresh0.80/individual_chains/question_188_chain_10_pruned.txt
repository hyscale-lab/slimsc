Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in crystals is calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters. Oh right, the general formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, that might not be exactly right. Or maybe it's a different formula because rhombohedral has all angles equal?

Wait, rhombohedral means all edges are equal, a=b=c, and all angles are the same, alpha=beta=gamma. Oh, right, so in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a cube that's been distorted, but all the edges are the same length. That's helpful because maybe the formula simplifies.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

The plane we're looking at is (111). So h, k, l are all 1. So substituting into the formula.

The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) - (2hl cos beta)/(a c) - (2kl cos alpha)/(b c)

But since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So let me substitute that in.

So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So the equation becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos α)/(a²) - (2kl cos α)/(a²)

Since h=k=l=1.

Plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1.

So:

1/d² = (1 +1 +1)/(a²) - [ (2*1*1 cos30) + (2*1*1 cos30) + (2*1*1 cos30) ] / a²

Simplify numerator:

Sum of squares: 3.

The other terms: each 2*1*1*cos30, and there are three of them. Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the second part is 3*( 2 * 0.8660 ) / a²? Wait, wait no. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. The second part is [ (2hk cos α) + (2hl cos β) + (2kl cos gamma) ] / (a²) because a=b=c.

So each term is (2*1*1 * cos30) and there are three terms, so 3
