Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is built from a set of higher-dimensional operators that respect certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries all operators must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So operators must be scalars or higher tensor structures that are compatible with the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translational symmetries. Oh right, because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is that automatically taken care of by Lorentz? Because I think that in the Standard Model, the Poincare symmetry is part of the foundation. So operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare symmetry as well because that's part of the underlying structure. So 2 should also be correct.

Wait, but sometimes people say that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies Poincare too because it includes translations. So if Lorentz is required, Poincare must be as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.
