Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the star's spectral lines shifted periodically because of the Doppler effect.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's star shifted 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star in the orbit. The formula includes the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and distance, something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/3) ? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) )

But wait, since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_p + M_star ≈ M_star. And the planets have circular orbits, so e is zero. So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but I might be getting it wrong. Maybe a better approach is to recall that the RV method relates the velocity shift to the mass and the period.

Alternatively, the key relation is that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P * (a)^2)) )^(1/3)? Wait, maybe I should think about the Doppler formula for the velocity.

The star's velocity K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since the planets are much less massive than the stars, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And since sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbit), we can ignore that for the ratio. So K is roughly proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me write this correctly. K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P
