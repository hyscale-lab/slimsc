Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

Alright, the setup is this: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, so it's like a hollow sphere inside the conductor. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Got that.

Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions, each involving some combination of these variables. I need to figure out which one correctly represents the electric field at point P.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about the concepts here. I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor?

I think the key here is the method of charges induction. When you place a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Wait, let me recall: for a conductor with a cavity, any charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge equal to the charge inside the cavity. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

No, the conductor is initially neutral. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because the conductor is a conductor, the electric field inside it must be zero. So the inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q.

So the conductor as a whole has a net charge of zero, but the charges are redistributed: inner surface -q, outer surface +q.

But wait, the point
