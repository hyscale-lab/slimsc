Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, what's the qubits space exactly?

The density matrix given is rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh right, that looks familiar. I think this is a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0><0| and |1><1|. Let me write it out. The basis states |0> and |1> are orthonormal, so when I expand them:

|0><0| is a matrix with a 1 in the (1,1) position, and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in (2,2). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 1/2.

So rho is a 2x2 matrix:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, but how does this relate to the qubit space? I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a single qubit state is represented as a vector in a 3D space. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a unit vector on the sphere. But for mixed states, like density matrices, the representation is a bit different.

The Bloch vector for a qubit state is defined in terms of the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a general density matrix rho, the Bloch vector r is given by r = (x, y, z), where x = Tr(rho X), y = Tr(rho Y), z = Tr(rho Z), and X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So let me compute each component. First, the Pauli matrices:

X = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Now, compute Tr(rho X). The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of rho multiplied by X. Let's compute rho X:

rho is (1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]], so rho X is (1/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]? Wait, no, wait. Actually, computing Tr(rho X) is the sum of the diagonal elements of rho multiplied by X.

Wait, no. Tr(rho X) is the trace of the matrix product rho multiplied by X. So let's compute that. 

rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], X is [[0,1], [1,0]]. So rho X is:

(1/2)*[[0*1/2 + 1*0, 0*0 + 1*1/2],
        [1*1/2 + 0*0, 1*0 + 0*1/2]]
Wait wait, no, perhaps more accurately, matrix multiplication. Let me compute each element.

rho X = (1/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [[1,0],[0,1]]? No, wait, rho is (1/2) times the identity, so rho = (I)/2.

So rho X = (I/2) X = (X)/2.

So the product would be X/2. Then, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of X/2. X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so X/2 has [[0, 0.5],[0.5,0]]. The trace is 0 + 0 = 0. So Tr(rho X) is 0. So x = 0.

Similarly, Tr(rho Y) would be the trace of (rho Y). Y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So rho Y is (1/2)*[[0, -i],[i, 0]]. The diagonal elements are 0 and 0, so trace is 0. So y = 0.

Tr(rho Z) is Tr(rho Z) = Tr( (1/2 I) Z ). Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so (1/2) Z is [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]]. The trace is 0.5 + (-0.5) = 0? Wait wait, no. Wait, Tr(rho Z) is the sum of the diagonal elements of rho Z. Wait, rho Z is (1/2) I * Z, which is (1/2) Z. The trace is (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(-1) = (1/2 - 1/2) = 0? Wait, but that can't be right because I thought rho is a completely mixed state.

Wait, another approach. The density matrix I have is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere, the state is at the origin because it's completely mixed. Because a maximally mixed state has no preference in any direction, so its Bloch vector is (0,0,0).

Wait, but maybe I should think about this differently. Let me think about the general form of a density matrix for a qubit. A general density matrix can be written as:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So in this case, our rho is (I)/2. So that would imply that r·σ must be zero, because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. Therefore, r must be the zero vector.

So r is (0, 0, 0), which corresponds to option C.

Wait, looking back at the options: option C is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So the answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho X), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z),
\]

and \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the trace calculations yield:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho X) = 0, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho Y) = 0, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho Z) = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the qubit space. This is consistent with the fact that the maximally mixed state has no preference in any direction and is completely depolarized.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
