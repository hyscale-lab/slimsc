Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think this through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cut-off' or some other method to make the math finite, and then you remove the cut-off later, hopefully getting a finite result.

So, which theories don't require this? Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? Like Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical theories, do we even have these infinities? Well, I remember something about the classical electron being a problem. If you consider the electron as a point charge, the electric field becomes infinite at the origin, leading to infinite self-energy and other issues. But wait, those are more conceptual problems within the classical framework. Do you need regularization in the same way as in quantum theories?

But wait, in quantum theories like QED, you have loop diagrams and other things that lead to divergences that require regularization. So classical theories might not need regularization because they don't perform the same kind of calculations. Or maybe they do because of similar infinities? Hmm.

Wait, the question is about whether the theory never requires regularization. So, which of these theories are free from such issues at high energies?

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a theory that deals with the strong force. I think QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative methods work better. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? I don't think so. QCD still has divergences, so you need to regularize. So option B probably requires regularization.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. QED definitely has issues with divergences in loop calculations. For example, the calculation of the electron mass and charge gets these infinities
