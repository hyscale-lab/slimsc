Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, so the state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. And we're supposed to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of a certain operator A. The operator A has matrix elements A_ij equal to hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is diagonal? No, wait. Because for a 2x2 system, |up> and |down> are the basis states. So the operator A would have zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 , 0 ]

Right? Because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So it's the off-diagonal elements that are non-zero. So this operator A is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Because A_ij would be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So, wait, because Pauli X has 1s in the off-diagonal positions and 0s on the diagonal. So, operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of A? Because the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of A. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, scaled by hbar/2. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for A, they would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), i.e., hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, they are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x is the spin-flip operator in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, just scaled by a factor.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. The eigenstates are determined by the matrix, regardless of the scaling. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x because A is a scalar multiple of sigma_x. So
