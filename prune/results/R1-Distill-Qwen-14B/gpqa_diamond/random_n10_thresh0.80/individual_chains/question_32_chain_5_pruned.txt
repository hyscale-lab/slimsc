Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, natural lithium has different isotopes. The isotope with 3 neutrons would be Li-6 because the atomic number of Li is 3. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making its mass number 6.

So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus. Now, I need to calculate the energy required so that this nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. But wait, since it's a heavy ion, I think relativistic effects are definitely in play here. So, the energy isn't just the kinetic energy; it's probably the total energy. Or maybe they're asking for the kinetic energy? The question says "energy of RHIC," which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ions, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm, but wait, RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, so their total energy would be gamma times the rest mass energy, but the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) times the rest mass energy. So I need to clarify whether the question is about total energy or kinetic energy.

The problem states that the speed
