Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are scalars such that when you apply the operator to the eigenvector, you just scale it by that scalar.

First, the problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Matrix S has the form: the first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write that down more clearly.

So, S = [ [0, -i],
          [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i],
                 [i, 0] ]

Wait, but to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I think I need to solve the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's compute that.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -a       ,  -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)) ,  -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is calculated as:

(-a)(-a) - [ -i*(h/(4π)) * i*(h/(4π)) ] = 0

So, (a^2) - [ (-i)*(i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ] = 0

Wait, let's compute that term. (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h/(4π))^2 * 1.

So determinant equation: a^2 - (h/(4π))^2 = 0 → a^2 = (h/(4π))^2 → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait. Planck's constant h is usually 2πħ, right? Oh wait, no, I think ħ is h/(2π). So h = 2πħ.

Wait, but in the problem statement, c is defined as h/(4π), which would be (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c= ħ/2. Oh, right! Because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is indeed ħ/2.

So c is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2. Wait, but in the options, I see options that involve h and pi. Let me make sure I'm not missing something.

Wait, the options mention eigenvalues in terms of h and pi. So let me express a in terms of h. Since ħ = h/(2π), then ħ/2 = h/(4π). So, a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues I found are real. So the options must be incorrect in that aspect.

Option B mentions imaginary parts of ±1/2. Hmm, no because the eigenvalues are real. So that doesn't fit either.

Option C says the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A². Let's think. Since A is the angular momentum operator, A² is the square of the angular momentum. For angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are not necessarily eigenfunctions of A². Wait no, actually, for angular momentum, the square is known. For example, in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum J² commutes with each component Jx, Jy, Jz. So if a state is an eigenstate of Jx, it's also an eigenstate of J². But wait, wait, in this problem, are we dealing with spin-1/2 particles?

Wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so its intrinsic angular momentum is spin. The spin matrices for spin-1/2 are 2x2, so S is the spin operator. So, in this case, the operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, in the problem statement, Ay is c*S, where c=h/(4π), which is (h/(4π)) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So Ay is (ħ/2) * S. Oh wait, no: wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix, and Ay is c times S, which is (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but in any case, the operator Ay has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But the square of the angular momentum operator A² would be (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. But wait, no—in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum (like J²) is the Casimir operator and has eigenvalues j(j+1) ħ². For spin-1/2, j=1/2, so A² eigenvalues would be (3/4) ħ².

So, if Ay is a component of the angular momentum, then any eigenstate of Ay (which is a component) is also an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with each component. Because [A², A_y] =0, so they share eigenstates. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, then it must also be an eigenstate of A². So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, but why not of Az?

Wait, no. For spin-1/2 particles, the three components don't commute with each other. So you can't have a state that is an eigenstate of two different components at the same time. So, if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it cannot be an eigenstate of Az. So option C is correct in that part.

But wait, looking at option C: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." So that seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C sounds correct.

Now, looking at the other options. Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so that's correct. But in quantum mechanics, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So, yeah, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So option D could also be correct. But wait, the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct" — so perhaps more than one of the options is correct, but only one is the right choice.

Wait, let me think again. Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So that's correct. So that's one correct statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors (which are the eigenfunctions here) form a basis for the vector space. So yes, that's correct. So D is correct. So which options are correct?

Wait, looking back at the problem, which asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps more than one is correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, let's go through all options again.

Option A: The eigenvalues are imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Correct. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct as well, because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

So both C and D would be correct statements. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me re-read the options.

Looking at the question, the options are:

Option C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which of these is correct? Let's think.

Option D: The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. The matrix is a 2x2, so its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So if both C and D are correct, but the options are multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the operator Ay is a spin component, so its eigenfunctions are spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction. Now, A² is the square of the spin, which for spin-1/2 is 3/4 ħ². So in that case, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct. So C is a correct statement, so that's one correct option.

But let me check the matrix Ay. The matrix is (h/(4π)) times S. Since S is the given matrix.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S first. Since Ay is proportional to S, their eigenvalues would be proportional too.

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The eigenvalues of S can be found by solving det(S - λ I) = 0.

Which gives:

| -λ     -i      | = λ^2 + (i)(-i) (because the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i)(-i) → wait, no wait, the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i^2) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( -i² ) = λ² - (1) because i² is -1, so -i² is 1.

Wait, but wait, (-i)(i) = (-i) * i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Then, since Ay = c S, with c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So when looking at the options, any options stating that the eigenvalues are real and have these values would be correct. But looking at the options, none of the options A or B match exactly.

Wait, option A: "The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π." But our eigenvalues are purely real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: "The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1." Again, our eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

So among the options, the only possible correct statements are C and D.

Now, let's think again about option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so it's acting on a 2-dimensional vector space. The eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis for this space, as they are two and orthogonal (since the matrix is Hermitian, assuming S is Hermitian). Wait, is S Hermitian?

Looking at S: [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

The conjugate transpose of S is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ].

Which is equal to S^T, since S is anti-Hermitian: S^† = -S. Because S^† is equal to -S.

Wait, let me compute S^†:

S is [[0, -i],
      [i, 0]]

The conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and make them their conjugates. So:

[ [0, i], 
  [-i, 0] ]

But the original S has [i, 0] as the second row. So transposing and conjugating gives [0, i], [ -i, 0 ].

Wait, comparing to the original S: the original S has -i in the (1,2) position and i in (2,1). So S^† is equal to the negative of S multiplied by -1.

Wait, S^† = [[0, i],
           [-i, 0]]

And S itself is [[0, -i],
               [i, 0]]

So S^† = [[0, i],
          [-i, 0]] = - S, because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so negative S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

So S^† = -S → which means S is anti-Hermitian. Because for an anti-Hermitian matrix, S^† = -S.

So Ay = c * S → c is real, so Ay^† = c * S^† = c (-S) = - c S = -Ay.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian. That is, it's equal to negative its conjugate transpose. But in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which should be Hermitian because it's an observable. So perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, maybe the matrix S is defined as (1/2)σy, where σy is the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σy is Hermitian. So S would be (1/2)σy, which is Hermitian.

Wait, the given S matrix in the problem is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is Hermitian. So S is (1, 2) σy. Wait, no, S in the problem is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian.

Wait, then S is Hermitian. So S^† = S. Let me check that again. For the matrix S:

The (1,2) element is -i, and the (2,1) is i.

The conjugate transpose would have (1,2) as i, and (2,1) as -i. But the original S has (2,1) as i, so S^† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. Wait, no, S^† is:

Take each element (i,j) to (j,i) and take the complex conjugate. So for element (1,2) in S, which is -i, the conjugate is i, and it becomes element (2,1) in S^†. Similarly, element (2,1) of S is i → element (1,2) of S^† is -i.

So the S^† matrix is:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is equal to σy, which is the same as S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S^† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is same as S because S itself is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, no, S^† is not the same as S. Because S has (1,2)=-i, but S^† has (1,2)=i. So S^† is not equal to S, which would be necessary for Hermiticity.

Wait, so that suggests that S is anti-Hermitian, because S^† = -S. Wait, let me compute:

If S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S^†. So S^† = -S → which makes S anti-Hermitian.

So the operator Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian because c is real. So Ay = c S → Ay^† = c S^† = c (-S) = - c S = -Ay.

But observables are Hermitian, so that's a problem. I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition. Maybe the matrix S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Let me check again.

Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed Hermitian because S^† = S.

Wait, wait no, no. Let me compute S^† for S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i, which would be at (2,1) in S^†. But S^† would look like:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is the same as S. Because S itself is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^† is S → so S is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay = c S is Hermitian because c is real. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that S^† is not equal to S. Let me do it step by step.

S = [[a, b],
     [c, d]]

S^† is [[a*, c*],
        [b*, d*]]

So for S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], the conjugate is:

a = 0 → a* =0.

b = -i → b* = i.

c = i → c* = -i.

d =0 → d* =0.

So S^† is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as S. So S is Hermitian. Then my earlier conclusion was wrong. So the operator Ay is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

So then, the eigenvalues of S are ±1, and thus the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

So, the eigenvalues are real, and thus their imaginary parts are zero. Among the options, only options C and D are possible.

Now, looking back at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But they can't share eigenfunctions with Az because of commutativity.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, only one can be the correct answer.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space.

But in the options, if both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as separate choices, which can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are not necessarily eigenfunctions of A². Wait no, because A² commutes with Ay. So any eigenstate of Ay must be an eigenstate of A² as well.

Wait, yes, because [Ay, A²] = 0, so they share eigenstates.

So, for option C, this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

So, both C and D are correct statements. But the options say which statement is correct, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the calculation process. So, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Let me think: when you solve for the eigenvectors, the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator. So option D is correct. But then, eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is option C.

But looking at the options, perhaps only option C and D are correct. But the options are given as A to D, and only one is correct.

Wait, wait, the problem says 'which statement will you consider to be correct' — meaning only one is correct. So perhaps another approach.

Looking again at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which of these is correct.

I think both are correct, but perhaps only one is an option. Wait, the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct statement is option C because the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Alternatively, option D could be correct, but I need to determine which is correct.

Wait, the problem is about the correct statement during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct), and that they can be eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct). But the options don't allow for both to be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option D. The statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. In quantum mechanics, the matrix operator's eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form an orthonormal basis for the space. So, option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So, D is correct.

But in the options, only one can be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the matrix S is spin σy matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. Then Ay is c times that, so eigenvalues are ±c.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps in the process of calculating the eigenvalues, one of the options is correct.

Wait, the possible eigenvalues we found are ±h/(4π). Looking back at option B, the eigenvalues are imaginary parts of ±1/2 and real parts ±1, but eigenvalues are real, so that's incorrect. Option A has imaginary parts which are impossible.

So, during the calculation, the correct statements are C and D. But as this is a multiple-choice question with four options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct statement is option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Because the matrix is 2x2, it's true. So option D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me summarize:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π).

Eigenfunctions form a basis for R^2 (so D is correct).

Eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az (so C is correct).

But the options are only four, and the correct answer is one of them.

Looking back, the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix form a basis, so option D is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier reasoning says that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the problem is about the calculation, and during the calculation, you would realize that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct because it's a property of the eigenfunctions of a component of angular momentum, whereas option D is always true for any 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C). But the options don't have both as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the only correct statement is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, that's correct. So D is correct.

So, both C and D are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

But the problem says 'which statement below will you consider to be correct' — so perhaps only option D is correct.

Wait, but I previously thought that option C was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit stuck. But based on the process, I think that option C is correct. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a given 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields eigenvalues \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so any statement claiming imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**
   - This option claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary parts.

3. **Option B:**
   - This option claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Option C:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum).
   - This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning their eigenfunctions are shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 matrix form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation," the focus is on the properties relevant to the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \). Option C highlights a key property of the eigenfunctions in the context of angular momentum, making it the most appropriate choice.

ANSWER: C
