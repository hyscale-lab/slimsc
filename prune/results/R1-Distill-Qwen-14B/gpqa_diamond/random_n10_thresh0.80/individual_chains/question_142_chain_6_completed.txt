Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices represent quantum states, especially when dealing with mixed states. But this looks like a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Oh right! Because it's a statistical mixture, each term is multiplied by 1/2. So this must be a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, what's a completely mixed state again? I think a completely mixed state is when the qubit is in a state of maximal uncertainty. Like, the density matrix becomes the identity matrix scaled by 1/(2^n), where n is the number of qubits. Since this is a single qubit, it's 1/2 times the identity matrix. So ρ would be [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

But how does this translate into the geometric position in qubit space? I'm a bit confused about how the density matrix maps to a point in space. Oh right! For a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states inside.

Wait, the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) such that |r| ≤ 1. So if I can express ρ in this form, I can find the components of r.

Given ρ here is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write that out:

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
|1⟩⟨1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]
Adding them gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], so ρ = (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, but the identity matrix is I. So I = [[1,0],[0,1]], so ρ = (I)/2. Now, using the general form: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me set them equal.

(I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. So r·σ must be zero matrix. The only way that's possible is if r is zero vector. Because if r is non-zero, then r·σ would have some components.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the completely mixed state is the center of the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, so the origin is the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. A completely mixed state corresponds to maximal uncertainty about the qubit's state, which geometrically places it at the center of the Bloch sphere. 

To analyze this further, the general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector such that \(|\vec{r}| \leq 1\). Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the term \(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\) must vanish, meaning \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the origin in qubit space, which is the geometric representation of the completely mixed state.

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
