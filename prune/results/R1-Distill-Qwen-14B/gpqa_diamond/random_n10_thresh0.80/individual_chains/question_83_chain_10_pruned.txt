Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they should form sodium acetate and water. 

Let me read the question again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, so after dilution, the new concentration would be:

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2
M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³
M2 = (1) / 40 → Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, for the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The question says 25% titration. Hmm, 25% of what? Oh, I think it refers to the percentage of the stoichiometric amount of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point.

So let's find out the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Because at equivalence, the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, volume = 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0
