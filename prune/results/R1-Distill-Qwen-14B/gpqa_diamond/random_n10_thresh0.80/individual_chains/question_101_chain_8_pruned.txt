Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. We need to determine what reagent (A) and catalyst (B) were used.

Hmm, I remember that when amines react with carbonyl compounds under certain conditions, they can form various products. Wait, in this case, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached, which is a cyclic ketone or something similar. So maybe this is a type of alkylation or some kind of cyclization reaction.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic secondary amine. When amines react with carbonyl compounds, like aldehydes or ketones, under acidic conditions, they typically undergo some kind of addition or alkylation. Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt or some aldol-like condensation? Or perhaps it's an example of a Mannich reaction? Or maybe a ring expansion?

Wait, another thought: pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. The cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexene ring, like a substituted cyclohexene attached via a methylene group.

Wait, if the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product has an additional substituent attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidene-methyl group. So how does this happen?

I think this might involve the formation of an imine or enamine. Wait, wait, no, enamine formation usually involves a secondary amine reacting with a ketone or aldehyde to form a conjugated amine. Enamines are typically used in conjugate additions.

Alternatively, maybe this is an example of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, pyrrolidine is a ring with a nitrogen, which might deactivate it towards electrophilic substitution. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the product is
