Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. 

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime. Oh right, the longer the lifetime, the further they can travel before decaying. But how does that connect to the given parameters?

I think the mean decay length is calculated using the formula: 
Decay Length (L) = c * τ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ from the given data? I recall that the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, right, because the uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.

So putting that together, τ = ħ / Γ. Then, L = c * τ = c * ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Let me check. The decay width Γ is given in MeV, but I need to convert that into energy units compatible with c and ħ. 

Let me jot down the constants I'll need:

- Planck constant ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (femtometers) because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. Oh wait, I remember that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = ħc / c, but maybe it's easier to use ħc in this case.

Alternatively, using natural units might complicate things. Let me think. Maybe I should calculate the lifetime first.

Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, perhaps I should convert everything to the same units.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's see, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and natural units have ħc
