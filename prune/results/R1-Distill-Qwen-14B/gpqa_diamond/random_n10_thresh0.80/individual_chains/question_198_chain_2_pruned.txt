Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about stability constants and all that. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, so first, I remember that stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The general idea is that the higher the β, the more the complex is favored.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2−+n species. So, β1 corresponds to the first complex, like CoSCN^+, β2 is Co(SCN)2^2+, β3 is Co(SCN)3^3+, and β4 is Co(SCN)4^4−. Wait, but wait, the number of SCN- ions attached might be different. Oh right, for each step, adding another SCN-.

But wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- groups. So the species we're interested in is Co(SCN)_2^(2+), which probably corresponds to β2 or β3? Wait, no. Let me think. The first complex β1 is the formation of Co(SCN)^+, which is +1 charge. The second, β2, would be Co(SCN)2^(2+), which is +2 charge. So β2 is the stability constant for the second complex. But wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato', which is two SCN- groups. So that's the Co(SCN)2^(2+) complex, so the β we should consider is β2=40. But wait, the answer options are about the blue complexes, which I think might refer to the higher order complexes, maybe the third or fourth. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the colors. I'm a bit hazy on the exact colors of different cobalt complexes. But maybe I should proceed with what I know.

So the problem
