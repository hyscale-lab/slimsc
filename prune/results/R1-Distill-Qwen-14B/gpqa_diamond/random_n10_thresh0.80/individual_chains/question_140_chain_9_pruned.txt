Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's this Substance X, which uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. 

Another clue: when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, Substance X. It's reacting violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Or maybe an acid or base. Wait, but the product is a precipitate and a gas. Let's think about what reactions produce gases and precipitates.

The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule's formula must be such that the atomic number equals the mass number. Let's think of some gases. For example, H2O has proton and neutron counts of 1 each for H, 8 each for O... Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's something like CO2? Wait, no, because carbon has 6 protons and oxygen 8. No, wait, the molecule's total. Wait, the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons. Let's see. Let's think of possible gases.

Wait, if W is a gas, possible candidates might be H2, O2, NH3? Wait, no. Wait, for example, the gas could be CO2. Let's see, CO2 has 1 C atom (6 protons, 6 neutrons maybe) and 2 O atoms (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*(8-8 if we're assuming the regular O-16 isotope? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for each molecule of W, sum of protons (atomic numbers) equals sum of neutrons (mass numbers minus atomic numbers) for each atom in the molecule.

Wait, maybe W is something
