Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of the star (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transit. 

The problem asks: What would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as this spotted star? So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits?

Hmm, okay. So I need to calculate the relative radius of the planet compared to the star, Rpl/Rstar.

Let me think about how brightness variations work. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and the star.

Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a variation in brightness as the star rotates. Since the spots are cooler, when they're on the side facing us, the star's overall brightness would be a bit less than when they're not. So the change in brightness due to the spots' rotation would mimic the effect of a planet transiting.

Wait, but in this case, the star is showing a variation due to its own spots, but the question is about what planet size would mimic that same variation if it were a planet causing the dip. So I need to model the situation where the star's brightness change from spots is similar to the dip from a planet.

Let me break it down. The star's brightness without spots would be uniform. With spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total brightness is lower. The change in brightness (the amplitude of the variation) is what we're interested in.

So I think I need to calculate the change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and compare that to the change from a planet transiting.

But wait, the star is only partially spotted. The filling factor is 20%, which I believe refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So each hemisphere has a 20% coverage of spots. But since the entire star has two hemispheres, but the spots are only on one, the total area covered is 20% of one hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% for the entire star. Oh, wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere has 20% spot coverage—meaning the total spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, maybe I should think of the star's surface as a sphere. The area of a sphere is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere has 20% spots, the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface that is spotted. No, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps only 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because a hemisphere is half the sphere.

Wait, but the star is spherical, so each hemisphere has an area of 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4π R².

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The variation in brightness depends on whether the spotted hemisphere is facing us or not. When the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is normal. When they're on the near side, the brightness is lower because some of the surface area is cooler.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between the bright (no spots visible) and dim (spots visible) states.

So, the star's normal flux (F0) is its total luminosity. The flux when spots are visible (F_spots) is slightly less because the spots are cooler.

I think I need to calculate the difference in flux between the two states and set that equal to the flux difference caused by a planet transit.

Wait, no. The problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the variation caused by the spots would be similar to that caused by a planet with a certain radius. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as that caused by the planet.

So, the change in flux when the spots are visible compared to when they're not is the same as the change when a planet transits.

Let me model this.

Flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power. So the total flux from the star is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πRstar².

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (flux from the spots) + (flux from the surrounding area which is normal temperature).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the flux when the star is in the spotted state and when it's not, and find the difference.

Wait, no. The star is normally at 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

So when the spotted
