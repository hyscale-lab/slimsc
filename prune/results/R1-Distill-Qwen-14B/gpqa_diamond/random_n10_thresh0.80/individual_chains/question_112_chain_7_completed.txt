Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about an electron's spin state and measuring probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. So, these are the standard basis states for the spin-½ system.

But wait, the question is about another operator whose matrix representation is A_ij. The matrix elements are hbar/2 when i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me visualize it. For a 2x2 matrix, if the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, the matrix looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Ah, wait, no. Because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j each take values 1 and 2. So, A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, while A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but isn't that the same as the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, and the average value of A.

First, I think I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Because when measuring an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenstates.

So let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, it's manageable.

The matrix A is:
0     hbar/2
hbar/2 0

The eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving det(A - lambda I) = 0.

The characteristic equation is:
| -lambda    hbar/2         |
| hbar/2    -lambda        | = 0

Which gives lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So lambda squared equals (hbar^2)/(4), so lambda is ± hbar/2.

Wait, no. Let me compute that determinant properly.

The determinant is (-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) )= lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2.

Setting this to zero: lambda^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → lambda = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait. The operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenstates would be the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.

Let me find the eigenvectors for lambda = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2     -hbar/2 ]

Which can be written as:

Multiply each element by 2/hbar to simplify:
[ -1    1 ]
[ 1    -1 ]

The equations are:
-1*v1 + 1*v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1), or |+x> state.

Similarly, for lambda = -hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ hbar/2      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2     hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to:
[1 1]
[1 1]

The equation: (hbar/2)v1 + (hbar/2)v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is (1, -1), which is the |-x> state.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, or perhaps the other way around. Wait, the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), so each normalized by 1/sqrt(2), right?

But wait, the actual operator A has matrix elements in the z basis, so the eigenstates are in the x basis.

So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Now, the given state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

But wait, the state is given as proportional. So we need to normalize it.

Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = k*(1+i)|up> + k*(2 - i)|down>, where k is 1/sqrt(N), N being the norm squared.

Compute the norm squared N = |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So N = 2 +5=7.

So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of A are the squared magnitudes of the inner products of |alpha> with the eigenstates of A.

So let's compute the inner product between |alpha> and |+x>, and between |alpha> and |-x>.

First, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down> ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ].

Wait, because <up|up> is 1, same for <down|down>, and cross terms are zero.

So that becomes (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ].

Simplify numerator: 1 +i +2 -i = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3^2)/(14) =9/14≈0.642857.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. So that's about 64% chance to get +hbar/2.

Now, the other eigenstate is |-x>, which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Compute < -x | alpha >.

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ 1 +i -2 +i ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, the expression inside is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357. But the sum of the probabilities should be 1. 9+5=14 → 14/14=1. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of < -x | alpha >.

The state |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So when you take the inner product with |alpha>,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down| alpha> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1-2) + (i +i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

Ah, yes, so the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.357143.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which don't match. Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to our calculated 0.642857 and ~0.357, but 0.36 is a bit higher than 0.357. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7 )

= (1/sqrt(2*7)) [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [3]

So that gives 3/sqrt(14), and the magnitude squared is 9/(14). That's correct.

For the other state, < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7 )

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i -2 + i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14. So yes.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64286 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. That's very close, but perhaps the given options are approximated.

Wait, but option C is 0.28 and 0.72. That's 2/7 and 6/7, which would be 4/14 and 12/14. Not the same as 5/14 and 9/14.

Hmm. So which option has probabilities about 0.64 and 0.36? Option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7)

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7)

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7)

So option A has probabilities 0.64 (9/14 is approx 0.642857) and 0.36 (5/14 is approx 0.35714). So 0.64 and 0.36 are rounded to two decimal places.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> .

Another approach is to compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is given, perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since we've found the eigenvalues (+hbar/2 and -hbar/2) and the probabilities p_+ and p_-

The average value (expectation value) is p_+ * (hbar/2) + p_- * (-hbar/2) ) = (p_+ - p_-) (hbar/2).

Now, p_+ is 9/14, p_- is 5/14.

So (9/14 -5/14) =4/14 = 2/7.

Multiply by hbar/2: (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it directly.

Another way: compute <alpha| A |alpha> where A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i) / sqrt(7).

So the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So to compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, A is a matrix, so we have to do matrix multiplication.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using components.

Let me denote the components as a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A|alpha> is [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

So the inner product is a* (hbar/2 b) + b* (hbar/2 a )

= (hbar/2) ( a b* + b a* )

= (hbar/2) ( a b* + (a b*)^* )

Because a b* is a complex number and its conjugate is b a*.

So the sum is 2 Re( a b* ) multiplied by hbar/2.

So, let me compute a*b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a*b is (1+i)(2 -i) /7.

Compute (1+i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) = 2 -i +2i -i².

i squared is -1, so -i² is 1.

So 2 -i +2i +1 = 3 +i.

So a*b = (3 +i)/7.

The real part of a*b is 3/7.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * 2 * (3/7) ) = (hbar) * (3/7) = 3 hbar /7.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, a*b is (1+i)(2−i)/7.

Multiply it out:

(1)(2) = 2,

(1)(-i) = -i,

(i)(2) = 2i,

(i)(-i) = -i² = +1.

So sum:

2 -i + 2i +1 = 3 +i.

So a*b = (3 +i)/7.

The real part is 3/7.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * 2*(3/7) ) = hbar*(3/7).

Wait, because Re(a*b) is 3/7. So 2 Re(a*b) is 6/7, multiplied by hbar/2 → (hbar/2) * (6/7) ) = 3 hbar/7.

Hmm, but earlier when I used the probabilities, I found the expectation value to be (9/14 -5/14) * (hbar/2) )= (4/14) * (hbar/2) )= (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= hbar/7.

Wait, this is a discrepancy. So which is correct?

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let's recompute using the expectation value.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the probabilities method.

Because the expectation value is sum (p_i λ_i )

p_+ is 9/14, λ_+ is hbar/2.

p_- is 5/14, λ_- is -hbar/2.

So expectation value = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )

= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * hbar/2 → (2/7) * (hbar/2 ) = hbar/7.

But using the matrix method, I get 3hbar/7.

So which is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, let me compute the matrix method again.

The state |alpha> is (a, b)^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Operator A is (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0).

Compute A|alpha> = [ (0 * a) + (hbar/2) * b, (hbar/2)*a + 0*b ].

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = a* (hbar/2 b) + b* (hbar/2 a )

= (hbar/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

= (hbar/2) [ (a b*) + (a b*)^* ] = (hbar/2) [ 2 Re(a b*) ]

= hbar Re(a b* )

So compute a b*:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a b* = [ (1+i) (2 + i) ] /7.

Multiply (1+i)(2+i) = 1*2 +1*i +i*2 +i*i = 2 +i +2i +i².

i squared is -1, so 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So a b* = (1 +3i)/7.

The real part is 1/7.

So <A> = hbar * (1/7) ) = hbar/7.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. So what happened earlier?

Ah, I think I messed up the a and b in the matrix method.

Wait, earlier in the matrix method, I incorrectly said a*b is (3 +i)/7, but that was wrong. Because a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7), but when I compute a*b*, it's (1+i)(2 +i) /7.

Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, a is the first component, a = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

b is the second component, b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, a b* is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) = (1+i)(2+i)/(7).

(1+i)(2+i) = 2 +i +2i +i² = 2 +3i -1 =1+3i.

So a b* = (1+3i)/7 → Re(a b*) = 1/7.

Thus, the expectation value is hbar * (1/7) → hbar/7.

Wait, but that's contrary to what I got earlier when I used the probabilities. So which is correct.

Wait, the correct expectation value should be hbar/7, because that's what I get from both methods now.

Wait, earlier when I computed the expectation value using the probabilities, I got (9/14 -5/14) * (hbar/2 ) = (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * hbar/2 = hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, but when I first used the matrix method, I thought the a*b was (3+i)/7, but that was a mistake.

So the correct answer is probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, and expectation value hbar/7.

Looking back, option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 (~0.6429) and 5/14 (~0.3571).

So option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check all options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

Therefore, the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and calculating the average value of \( A \) for a given quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \). The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 2: Normalizing \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = k[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle] \), where \( k \) is the normalization constant. The norm is calculated as:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, \( k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), and the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of \( A \)
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are determined by the squared magnitudes of the inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \).

1. **For \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \):**
   \[
   \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(+x) = \left| \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429.
   \]

2. **For \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \):**
   \[
   \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(-x) = \left| \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
   \]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with options
The probabilities \( P(+x) \approx 0.64 \) and \( P(-x) \approx 0.36 \) (rounded to two decimal places) match the values in **Option A**. The average value \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \) also matches Option A.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\text{Option A: } 0.64, 0.36, \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Answer: A
