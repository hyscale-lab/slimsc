Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different distances.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. But wait, the mean lifetime is connected to the decay width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) and the uncertainty in time (the lifetime τ) are inversely related. The formula I think is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, wait. I think I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: the total decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, that seems right.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) would be the product of the particle's velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But how do I find the velocity? I remember that for relativistic particles, we can use the relation E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The velocity v can be found from β = v/c, and β is approximately 1 when γ is large, which it usually is for high-energy particles. But maybe I shouldn't approximate and should calculate it accurately.

Wait, the particle's energy is given as E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. So E is much larger than m, so it's definitely moving at relativistic speeds. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

First, let's compute the velocity. The total energy is E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but E is given in GeV, and m is also in GeV. Oh wait, units can be a bit tricky here. Let me think.

Actually, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, E (in GeV), m (in GeV/c²), and other units are related. But perhaps I should convert everything into standard units to avoid confusion.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate using the relation between energy, mass, and velocity without getting bogged down by unit conversions right away.

So, the energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². γ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c.

So, rearranging, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

But wait, since E is much larger than m c² (E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV), γ is approximately E/(m c²). But wait, wait, E is given as 8 GeV, which is about 8 * 10^9 eV. But the mass m is 1.2 GeV, so E = 8 GeV, which is 6.66 times larger than m (since 8 / 1.2 is approximately 6.666...). Hmm, not super huge, but significant.

So perhaps I should compute gamma as E divided by m. But wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so when you take E/(m c²), the units would be GeV/(GeV c²) * c², which is unitless. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals m c² (in GeV) only if m is in GeV/c². So, if E = 8 GeV and m =1.2 GeV/c², then E = 8 GeV = 8 * 1.6e-10 J. And m c² is 1.2 GeV, which is 1.2 * 1.6e-10 J, multiplied by c squared, but wait, no, in natural units, m c² is in GeV when m is in GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta using the formula:

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)}.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate gamma. Gamma is E / (m c²). Wait, but E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, E = gamma m c².

So, gamma = E/(m c²). Plugging in the values, E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Then, beta can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So, 1/gamma squared is (1/ (6.6667)^2) ≈ 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Take the square root: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute gamma more precisely. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666666...

So gamma = 6.666666...

So
