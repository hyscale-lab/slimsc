Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate, right? Let me think through each part of the problem.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition. I need to find the reactants and products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here. Wait, no, wait. In the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. So dimethyl malonate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, right? No, wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is (CH2COO2Me)2. It can form an enolate, but wait, in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the enolate will form. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me sketch that structure: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate group is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3rd position is the p-tolyl. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Maybe it's CH2=CH-C-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it (E)-configuration, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged opposite each other.

Wait, when the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position, the Michael addition occurs. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. But wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. Wait, but in this reaction, perhaps the
