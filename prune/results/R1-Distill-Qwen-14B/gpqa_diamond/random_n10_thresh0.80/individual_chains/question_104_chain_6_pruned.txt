Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit as the planet orbits it, and this movement changes the wavelength of the spectral lines we observe.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. The RV method detected these planets. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so I need to find the ratio of the periods, P2/P1. Right.

From what I recall, the RV method's measured Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity, which in turn is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass (Neptune is about 1/7000th the mass of the Sun, and stars are similar to the Sun), M_p << M_star. So the term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1. So we can ignore that denominator, right? So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * ( (1/(1 - e²)) )^(1/2) * ( (1) / (P) )^(1/3) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's think from the basics. The RV method detects the star's velocity. The star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2 π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ [ (G P ) / (2 π c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But wait, I think I might have messed up the exact formula. Let me think again. The formula I remember is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio between the two planets, since other factors are the same.

So, the two stars have same mass (M), and the two planets have same mass (m), but their Doppler shifts (K) are different. The question is how their orbital periods relate.

So for each planet, K is proportional to (m) / (M^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe better to write the formula for K. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ ( (G * P ) / (2 π) )^(1/3) ) * ( (m) sin i ) / ( (M + m)^(2/3) ) ) ] / (c)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the formula as:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (1/(2 π))^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should get the relation between K and P.

Alternatively, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )? Or maybe it's (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the formula is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

But that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the proportionality. Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets and their stars, respectively, the only variables are K and P.

So, for each planet:

K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2pi c)) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to find the correct formula. From what I remember, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M
