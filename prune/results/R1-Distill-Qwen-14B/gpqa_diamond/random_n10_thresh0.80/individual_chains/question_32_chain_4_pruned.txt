Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X actually is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then that's a total of 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Lithium has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons give a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds. The speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy depends on gamma, the Lorentz factor. The formula for the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So, the first thing I need is the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is ^6Li. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 can be looked up, but I don't have the exact value memorized. Wait, but maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using the mass of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the problem probably expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus. Let me think. The rest mass energy of a nucleus is usually the mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared, but since we are dealing with energy in GeV, which uses c=1 in those units, maybe I can just work with the mass in GeV/c² units.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The rest mass energy (m_0 c²) is calculated using the rest mass of the nucleus. So I'll need the mass of ^6Li in GeV/c².

Alternatively, I can calculate the mass of ^6Li using the binding energy, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the approximate mass of ^6Li. Let me think.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². A neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, 3*(938) + 3*(939) = let's calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV for protons.
3 * 939 = 2817 MeV for neutrons.
Total = 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Convert that to GeV: 5.631 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum of individual masses. The actual mass of ^6Li should be slightly less because of binding energy. Because when nucleons come together, the mass decreases by the binding energy divided by c². But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, perhaps the problem expects me to take the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, or maybe use an exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass. Wait, but without exact data, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the rest mass is approximately 5.631 GeV/c². Or perhaps the problem expects me to know that the mass of ^6Li is about 5.63 GeV/c². I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed with that.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, because the exact mass is about 6.014 u. Let me confirm: yes, I think ^6Li has a mass of approximately 6.014 u. Because the exact value is around there.

So, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.014 u would be 6.014 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, and 0.014 *931.5 = about 13.041 MeV. So total is 5589 +13.041 = 5602.041 MeV, which is 5.602041 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.602 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused because the initial calculation without considering binding energy gave 5.631 GeV, and using the exact mass of ^6Li as
