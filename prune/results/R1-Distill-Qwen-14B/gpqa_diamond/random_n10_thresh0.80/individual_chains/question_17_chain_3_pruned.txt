Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again. The question says that there's a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant (which I think is the same as the stability constant) is given. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is for the reaction where EDTA binds to Ca²+. The reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that's the concentration of the complex formed. So the total concentration of EDTA and calcium in solution comes from this complex, right?

So initially, without considering any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex can dissociate, the actual concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be much lower.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be y. But wait, considering the stoichiometry, each mole of Ca-EDTA complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- when it dissociates. So if the complex dissociates to some extent, the concentrations would be x and y. Wait, no, maybe because the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming it dissociates a little, say 's' amount, then:

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - s. But wait, wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, it produces one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- before dissociation are zero except for what comes from the complex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it using the formation constant expression. The total concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The dissociation would produce x = [Ca²+] and y = [EDTA^4-]. So the formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So plugging in the numbers, 5x10^10 = 0.02 / (x * y). But wait, here's a thought: in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think this means that the pH is such that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the various protonation states. So, all the EDTA is Y^4-.

But wait, another thing: since the complex is present, and the solution is such that the EDTA is deprotonated, the only sources of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are from the dissociation of the complex. So, the concentrations will be x and x because each dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Ah, right! Because for every mole of CaEDTA^2- that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting into the Kf expression: Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) => Kf = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5e10, so 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Let me solve for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) => x² = 2e-3 / 5e10? Wait no, wait 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 5e10 = (2e-2) / (x²) → x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) → x² = 4e-13 / 1e1? Wait, let me compute:

Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5)) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(10^-13)=10^(-6.5). So x is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.3e-7.

So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions would be this value.

Wait, but let me double-check. The formation constant is the
