Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a spread that doesn't overlap with the other state's peak if the difference is bigger than its uncertainty.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look for the formula. The energy difference ΔE between the two levels must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2. Because if ΔE is smaller than either, the states might overlap in their energy distributions, making them indistinguishable.

So, ΔE must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if it's larger than both, then the two energy levels don't overlap.

Wait, let's calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: τ1=1e-9 s. ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1) = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. To convert J to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. So about 6.6e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. So about 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 6.6e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.6e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1, which is about 6.6e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be clearly resolvable, ΔE must be greater than ΔE1, which is about 6.6e-7 eV.

Now looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 6.6e-7 eV. So no.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is much larger than 6.6e-7 eV. So this would satisfy ΔE > ΔE1, so it's resolvable.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → which is about the same magnitude as ΔE2, but less than ΔE1. So 1e-8 is smaller than 6.6e-7. So the energy difference would be smaller than the uncertainty in E1, meaning the two states would overlap in their energy distributions. So you can't distinguish them.

Wait a second, because if the energy difference is less than the uncertainties, then the probability distributions would overlap. But if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then there's no overlap, and the states are distinguishable.

So looking at the options, the only one that's larger than 6.6e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV). Let me check that again.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. 6.6e-7 eV is 0.00000066 eV. So yes, 1e-4 is much larger. So option C is the only one that's larger than both uncertainties.

Wait but wait, is the formula correct? Because ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, so the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or the maximum?

Alternatively, maybe each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty would be the sum. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Let's think: when you have two peaks in energy spectrum, each with their own width (uncertainty), the separation between their centers (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their half-widths (which are their uncertainties) for them to be resolvable.

Wait, that makes more sense. So if each state has a Gaussian (or Lorentzian) distribution in energy, the separation between the two peaks needs to be more than the sum of their half-widths at half-maximum (HWHM). So the necessary condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, the HWHM for a Lorentzian is ΔE = ħ/τ. So for the two states, their HWHM is each ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the separation between centers should be greater than the sum of these two. Because if it's less, the two peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Earlier, we found ΔE1 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV, and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is about 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.26e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 100e-6 eV. 7.26e-7 is 0.726e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is bigger than 0.726e-6. So option C satisfies ΔE > sum of uncertainties.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate 1e-4 eV in terms of 1e-7: 1e-4 is 1e3 *1e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 times bigger than 1e-7 eV. So yes, it's way bigger than the sum of 7.26e-7.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

Wait, but wait option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 10e-9 eV. Which is 0.1e-7 eV. The sum is about 7.26e-7 eV, which is 0.726e-6 eV. So 1e-8 is much smaller than the sum. So option D is too small.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C.


To determine the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

For the two states:
- State \( E_1 \) has a lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), so \( \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \). Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we get:
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- State \( E_2 \) has a lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), so \( \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \). Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). The sum of the uncertainties is:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 100 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the energy levels can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
