Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which involves the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to produce alkenes and halides. Wait, no, actually, more accurately, the Hunsdiecker reaction is when an alkyl halide reacts with a silver salt in the presence of strong acid to form an alkene. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Oh right, when you have a vicinal dihalide and treat it with a metal like sodium or potassium, you can get an elimination reaction to form an alkene. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones to reduce them to alkanes. Or wait, no, maybe when HI and red phosphorus are used in the presence of an alkyl halide, it's a dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes via elimination.

Wait, maybe I need to figure out what Compound X is first before worrying about the reaction. Let's look at the IR and NMR data.

Starting with the IR: The peaks are in the regions of 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe an N-H stretch, but in this context, more likely O-H. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is probably a carbonyl group. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe Compound X has a carbonyl group, an aromatic ring, and possibly an O-H group. So maybe it's an aromatic ester or a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring, perhaps. Or an aromatic ketone?

Looking at the NMR:

10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Since it's a broad signal, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (because aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but also broad). Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're usually broad because they exchange easily. So I'm leaning towards a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H): This is aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. In a para-substituted benzene, for example, the protons can be doublets. So, maybe para-substituted.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. If the first set is at 8.0 (d, 2H), this could be the ortho positions, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution? Hmm, no, wait, if it's a doublet for each, maybe it's para substitution with two substituents. Or maybe it's a substituent that causes the two protons to each couple with one other. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two substituents on the ring, causing each set of two protons to be doublets.

Then, the next signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for one proton. Maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like near a carbonyl or an oxygen.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, maybe part of a CH2 group next to another CH or something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet or doublet of 3H, which suggests a CH3 group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Wait, a doublet of 3H... So maybe a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another group. Like a (CH2) or maybe a branching point. For example, in an isobutyl group: CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, but in that case, the CH would be split into a septet or something, but here it's a doublet. Or perhaps it's a geminal group, like a CH3 attached to a CH which is attached to another CH2. Hmm.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, integrating for three protons, which likely comes from a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH3. The triplet is because the CH2 is next to another CH2 or something that splits it into a triplet.

Putting the NMR together, let's try to sketch the structure. So there's a para-substituted benzene ring. Two substituents in the para positions? Or one substituent with two groups attached?

Wait, let's consider the aromatic region. The 8.0 ppm (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H) could be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that has two protons, such as a ketone or an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the 8.0 and 7.2 are the para positions, that would mean something like a substituent on the ring causing the two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps there is a substituent that causes the ring protons to split into two doublets, such as a substituent with an adjacent substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to
