Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm. So, I think the operator P is probably the spin operator, since we're dealing with eigenvalues of ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 particles like muons. Muons are leptons, similar to electrons, and have spin-1/2.

The operator P is given in terms of its components. So, the total operator P is the vector sum of Px, Py, Pz. Wait, but for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, I think we can use the eigenvalue equation.

So, the operator P·n would be the component of the spin along direction n, and its eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, with eigenvectors being the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

But wait, the question says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're looking for the spin-up state along n.

First, I need to express the operator P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. Wait, or is it measured from the x-axis? Wait, no. In spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to θ=0 in the x-z plane, and varying θ would make it move towards the z-axis. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of θ as the angle from the z-axis. So, a point in the x-z plane would have y=0, so n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? Wait, no. Wait, if n is in the x-z plane, then its direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because when θ is 0, it's along z, and θ=90 degrees would be along x.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again: the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis, so for a point in the x-z plane, the angle φ (the azimuthal angle) would be 0 or π, since it's along the x or -x direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So when θ=0, n is along +z; θ=π/2, along +x.

So, the operator P·n would be the sum of the components of P in the x, y, z directions multiplied by the corresponding components of n. So,

P·n = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz.

Given that n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P·n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Now, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Given that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, because when θ is the angle from the z-axis, then:

n_x = sinθ * cosφ, but wait no, wait. Wait, no, if n is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is either 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1. So, I can write n_x = sinθ * (since cosφ is 1 or -1, but for simplicity, let's take it as sinθ
