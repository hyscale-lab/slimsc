Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector is to be normalized, so I need to find its elements based on the given options.

Hmm, let's break it down. So, the operator P is a vector operator, which probably means it's constructed from the components Px, Py, and Pz. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I'm thinking it's along some direction making an angle θ with the x-axis, maybe. So the operator along n would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

Wait, but n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So the operator P·n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Oh wait, but in the x-z plane, n could be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), right? Or maybe in spherical coordinates, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be zero, so n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. Wait, no, wait, for spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, but I think that's the azimuthal angle. So if n is in x-z, then its direction is determined by θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ * cosφ, but since in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, but wait: in spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the x-z plane would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ
