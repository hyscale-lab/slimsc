Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping in the Sun's core. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, and it has different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is the dominant one, right? Or is it the pp-I? I think the pp-I branch is the main one, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the question says the pp-III stopped, so I should focus on that.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? Well, the Sun emits neutrinos mainly through the proton-proton chain, which produces positrons and neutrinos. Specifically, the pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos, I think. But wait, the pp-III branch is also part of the chain. Let me recall: the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a helium-3 ion to form a helium-4 ion, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, no, maybe that's the pp-I branch. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a minor part of the proton-proton chain, perhaps in the core where temperatures are higher.

Wait, the pp-III branch is probably the dominant one because it's the main way the Sun generates energy. The pp-III reaction is 2 protons â†’ deuterium + positron + neutrino. No, wait, that's the first step. Then, if the pp-III branch stops, the other branches continue. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

The question is about neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the energy of the neutrinos? I remember that each nuclear reaction produces neutrinos of a certain energy. For example, the pp-III branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while other processes, like the CNO cycle, produce higher-energy ones. Wait, but the CNO cycle is more prominent in hotter stars, and the Sun is a G-type star, so the CNO cycle is a
