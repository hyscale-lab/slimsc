Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. Calcium, in this case. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (the complex). The K here is the formation constant, which is given as 5e10, a very large number. That means the complex is very stable; the reaction favors the product.

Wait, the complex solution is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of all forms of Ca in solution is 0.02 M. Because the complex is the only form present in solution, right? Or wait, no. Because EDTA could be in different forms depending on pH. But the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think that implies that EDTA exists predominantly in its active form, which can bind Ca²+.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Because the complex is Ca-EDTA, which is a big complex, so the free Ca²+ concentration is what we're looking for.

So the formation constant K is for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-

The K for this is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

But the total concentration of calcium species would be [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M? Or wait, no, because the complex is the only form present in that amount. Hmm, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So that
