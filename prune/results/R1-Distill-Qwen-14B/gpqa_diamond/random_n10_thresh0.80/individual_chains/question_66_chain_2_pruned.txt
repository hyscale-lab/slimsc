Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what symmetries must all operators respect?

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that all terms in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant because the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is built by adding terms that preserve that. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, it should also be Poincare symmetric because the effective field theory framework typically assumes translation invariance. Wait, but SMEFT is a field theory, so it includes Poincare symmetry as part of its structure. So operators must respect Poincare, meaning both 1 and 2 are required. So options including 1 and 2 are possible.

What about CP symmetry? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that the SMEFT can include operators that break CP symmetry, like some dimension-six operators. For instance, operators with three Higgs fields can lead to a potential that breaks CP, but wait, do all operators have to preserve CP? Or is it that some can violate it? I think CP is not necessarily a symmetry that all operators must respect. So option 3 (CP symmetry) might not be a must. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. The Standard Model itself doesn't have a CP symmetry because of things like the CKM matrix, so CP is not a symmetry of the SM. Therefore, SMEFT, which extends the SM, shouldn't require all operators to preserve CP. So operators can violate CP, meaning option 3 isn't a must. Therefore, 3 is not a required symmetry.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I'm pretty sure that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Because all the operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields with their interactions respecting CPT, the effective operators should also preserve CPT. So option 4 must be respected.

Putting this all together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) because they're part of the framework. CPT (4) must also be there. CP (3) isn't necessarily required. So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options given: option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), all operators must respect certain symmetries. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, as the Standard Model (SM) itself is Lorentz symmetric. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry, meaning all operators must also respect this symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that explicitly violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that all operators in SMEFT must respect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is built from the SM fields and interactions, which respect CPT symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also preserve CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
