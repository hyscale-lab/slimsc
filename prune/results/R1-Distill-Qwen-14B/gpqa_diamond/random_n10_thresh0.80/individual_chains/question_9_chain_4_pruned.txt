Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that point groups in molecules are classified based on their symmetry elements. The C3h point group means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So if a molecule has C3 symmetry and also a horizontal mirror plane, it would belong to the C3h group.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-..., and another one called triphenyleno[...]trifuran-... The options are labeled A to D.

Let me think about each molecule one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is in the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron? Wait, no, boron usually has a trigonal planar geometry, but wait, wait, wait, triisopropyl borane would be trigonal planar, but in triisopropyl borate, the boron is probably in a different environment. Wait, triisopropyl borate is actually a compound where the boron is surrounded by three isopropyl groups and a negative charge, but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's a trigonal planar molecule. But does it have C3h symmetry?

Wait, wait, triisopropyl borate is actually a trigonal planar molecule. Each isopropyl group is attached to boron. But does it have a three-fold rotation axis? Yes, because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, the three isopropyl groups would look the same. So the C3 axis exists. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm not so sure. The horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron atom and be perpendicular to the plane. Wait, if the molecule is planar, then the plane of the molecule itself would be a mirror plane. But wait, the horizontal mirror plane is σh, which is a plane that doesn't pass through the nuclei. Wait, I might be confusing the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is flat enough that a horizontal mirror plane exists.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look at the other options.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a structure where it's a bridge like a crown. I remember that quinuclidine has C3 symmetry. Because if you rotate it 120 degrees around the axis through the three bridgeheads, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine is a non-planar molecule, so maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. So it's C3 symmetry, but without a σh
