Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem states: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system... Oh right, that's the electrostatic potential energy. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so maybe the others are arranged around it.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from P. So point P is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

I'm trying to remember the formula for potential energy between point charges. It's U = k * (q1*q2)/r, but when there are multiple charges, you have to consider each pair. So for a system of n charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Right, the formula for the total potential energy U of a system of point charges is (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the sum over all pairs of (q_i * q_j)/r_ij. But
