Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait a second, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/d. Right, because parallax decreases as distance increases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax interval. So if I imagine a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx+dplx, how many stars are in that range?

I think this relates to the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let me think, so the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume.

Parallax and distance are inversely related. So for a given parallax range, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's say we have a parallax plx. The distance d = 1/plx. If the parallax increases by dplx, then the distance decreases. So the change in distance would be related to the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that.

d = 1/plx
dd = - (1/plx²) dplx

So the change in distance, dd, is proportional to dplx divided by plx squared. But wait, when plx increases, the distance decreases. So the actual distance interval from d to d - dd would be the corresponding interval for the higher parallax.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a shell with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume: n * 4π r² dr.

But since the number density is constant, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to r² dr.

Now, how does this relate to parallax? Since r = 1/plx, we can substitute that in. So r² is (1/plx)^2. And dr is the change in distance. But since we're considering a change in parallax dplx, we need to express dr in terms of dplx.

From earlier, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx (because d is decreasing as plx increases). Wait, no, because if plx increases, d decreases. So if I have a small change in plx, dplx, then the corresponding change in d is negative. But for the shell, we're considering a small change in distance dr. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, making dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a parallax interval dplx is proportional to r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, we get (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait
