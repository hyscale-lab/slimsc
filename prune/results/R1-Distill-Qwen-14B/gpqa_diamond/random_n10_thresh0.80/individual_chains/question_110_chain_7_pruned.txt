Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. The key is to figure out which of these stars have an apparent V magnitude that's bright enough to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

From the question, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, actually, the text says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means they can see stars up to 17 mag? Wait, no, wait. Brighter than 17 mag would mean that the apparent magnitude is less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤ 17. But wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me make sure: Oh, wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's V is brighter (i.e., has a lower apparent magnitude) than 17, then it's observable. So for ESPRESSO, any star with V <17 (brighter) can be seen. So the limit is V magnitude less than 17. But wait, no—apparent magnitude scale is such that brighter objects have lower magnitudes. So if it's brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17, so the maximum magnitude ESPRESSO can observe is 17. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 is detectable by ESPRESSO.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V <16 (apparent magnitude less than 16) are observable by HIRES. So the maximum apparent magnitude for HIRES is 16.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."
