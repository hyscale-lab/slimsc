Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's think through this carefully.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I need to determine which ones can be observed by both instruments. The key factors here are their apparent V magnitudes because each spectrograph has different brightness limits.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag. Wait, actually, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Oh wait, wait. Wait, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Because it's saying "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it would have a lower apparent magnitude, like 16 or 15. So for ESPRESSO, it can observe stars with V ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's V is less than 17. Because higher magnitude numbers mean fainter stars. So the limit is V ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no. Actually, in astronomy, a star with a lower apparent magnitude is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its magnitude is less than 17. So the condition is that the apparent V magnitude of the star must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO to detect it. Because if a star is brighter than 17 (i.e., apparent V ≤17), ESPRESSO can observe it.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V must be ≤16. Because "brighter than 16" means V is less than 16. So a star with V=16 is at the limit. So for HIRES, V ≤16.

So the stars that can be detected by both instruments must have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 because HIRES can't go beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So the star's V must be ≤16 to be observed by both.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. For a star to be detected by both, it must be within the observing range of both instruments. So for both to detect it, its V must be ≤16. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so if a star is fainter than 16, it's within ESPRESSO's range but not HIRES's.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The star must be bright enough (i.e., apparent magnitude low enough) to be observed by both. So the star's apparent V must be ≤
