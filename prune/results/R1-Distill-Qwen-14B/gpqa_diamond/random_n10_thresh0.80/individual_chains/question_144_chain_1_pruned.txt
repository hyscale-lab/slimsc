Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the formula involves the lifetime (τ), the velocity of the particle (βc), and the relation between the two for the decay length. The formula I think is L = γβcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Or wait, maybe it's cτ multiplied by βγ? I'm a bit confused, but I think it's something like (cτ) multiplied by the velocity factor.

But first, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh right, the width Γ of the resonance is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, which implies τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Γ is often given in energy units, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something. Let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So I'll need to convert Γ into GeV.

Wait, the given Γ is 320 MeV. Oh, right, since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, or did I mess up the exponents? Let me check: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, I need to find the velocity β and the Lorentz factor γ. How do I get those? Well, the total energy E of the meson is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is E = γ m c². Since we're working in units where c=1 (as in particle physics), E = γ m. So, γ = E / m. Plugging in the numbers, γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... or 20/3. Approximately 6.6667.

Now, the relation between γ and β is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So, from γ, I can find β. Let me solve for β. Rearranging, 1 - β² = 1/γ². So, β² = 1 - (1/γ²). Let's compute that.

γ is 20/3, so γ squared is (400/9). 1/γ² is 9/400, which is 0.0225. So, β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root: sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. That's pretty close to the speed of light.

Now, the velocity β is in terms of c, so when calculating the decay length, I'll need βc. But wait, the lifetime is τ, and the mean decay length L is given by L = γ β c τ. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The decay length is L = c * τ * γ β. Because the particle is moving at speed v = β c, and during its lifetime τ, it travels a distance v τ. But because of time dilation, the proper lifetime is τ0, and the dilated lifetime is τ = γ τ0. So, the distance is (β c) * τ = β c γ τ0. But since τ is the dilated lifetime, which is τ = γ τ0, then L = β c τ.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it more carefully. The mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the decay length is L = v τ. But v is βc, so L = β c τ. But wait, τ is the proper lifetime or the dilated? No, in this case, the lifetime τ is the dilated lifetime because it's measured in the lab frame where the particle is moving. Hmm, no, wait. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle gives τ as the proper lifetime, because the width is a property of the particle's own frame. So, τ is the mean proper lifetime, and the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by γ. So, the decay length would be L = v * (γ τ). Because the particle lives longer in the lab frame.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The proper lifetime is τ_0 = ħ / Γ. Then, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is τ = γ τ_0. So, the decay length is L = β c τ = β c γ τ_0 = β γ c (ħ / Γ). Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and perhaps using other relations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express L as L = c * τ * β γ. Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Maybe I should look for a formula.

Wait, the mean decay length is given by L = (c * τ) * (γ β). Because τ is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame sees the lifetime as γ τ, so the distance is v * (γ τ) = β c * γ τ. So, L = β c γ τ.

But tau is the proper lifetime, which is ħ / Γ. So, let's plug that in.

So, putting it all together:

L = β c γ (ħ / Γ)

Wait, but let's write all constants and variables in terms of what we have.

We have:

Γ = 0.32 GeV

ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s

c ≈ 3e8 m/s

β ≈ 0.9887

γ = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667

So, let's compute each term step by step.

First, calculate τ_0 = ħ / Γ.

τ_0 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV
