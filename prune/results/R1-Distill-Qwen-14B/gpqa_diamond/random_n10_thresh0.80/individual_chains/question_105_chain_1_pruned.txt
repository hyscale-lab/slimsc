Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that when a star has spots, it can cause dips in brightness when the spots rotate into and out of our view. The same effect happens when a planet transits in front of the star, blocking some light. So the problem is essentially asking, what size planet would cause the same change in brightness as the spotted area on the star.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar is about 1 solar radius, which is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number since it's a ratio we're looking for.

The star has a filling factor of 20% for the dark spots. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, I think. So each hemisphere has 20% coverage. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total spotted area would be 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm, but wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². If only one hemisphere is spotty, that's 2πR². So the total spotted area would be 0.2 * 2πR²? Or wait, maybe no—the filling factor is for each hemisphere. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (πR²) because a hemisphere is half the surface area. Wait, no, the surface area of a hemisphere is 2πR² (the curved part; or if including the flat disk, it's 3πR², but I think here it's just the curved part). Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the surface area. So the entire surface is 4πR², a hemisphere is 2πR². So the spotted area on one hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR²? Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 (per hemisphere) * 2πR² (hemisphere area) = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun. Oh, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots are either 7000K (unlikely, hotter than the star) or 5000K. Wait, the problem says a temperature difference, so maybe the spots are cooler. So spots are 6000 - 1000 = 5000K.

But wait, how does the temperature of the spots affect the brightness variation? Because when the spots are on the side facing us, they contribute less flux than the rest of the star. So during the rotation, when a spot comes into view, the total flux from the star decreases a bit.

But when we're talking about photometric variations caused by spots, the amplitude is the difference in brightness when the spots are on the front or back. So the change in flux is due to the spots
