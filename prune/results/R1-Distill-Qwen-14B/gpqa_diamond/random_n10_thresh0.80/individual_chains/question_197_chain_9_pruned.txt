Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, and there are four options provided.

First, let me think about what reaction involves red phosphorus and HI. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe the Wittig reaction? Wait, no. Wait, the Hunsdiecker reaction is when a bromoalkane or chloroalkane reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form an alkyl iodide. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid derivative reacting with PBr3 or something similar, but in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction comes to mind: the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. Red phosphorus is sometimes used to reduce an acyl chloride to an aldehyde. Wait, no, wait. When you have an acyl chloride reacting with red phosphorus, it typically gets converted into an aldehyde. Because, for example, RCOCl + P → RCHO. Alternatively, sometimes it's used to reduce esters or other carbonyl compounds. But wait, wait, in the presence of HI, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus with HI is part of the hydroiodic acid formation. So when you have an alkyl halide, especially with a good leaving group, reacting with HI could cause an elimination or substitution. But red phosphorus is often used to prepare HI in situ from iodine and phosphorus. Oh, right! Because red phosphorus reacts with iodine to produce HI. So if Compound X is, say, an alkyl bromide or chloride, adding red phosphorus and HI would substitute, replacing the leaving group (like Br) with I.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if Compound X is an ester, like RCOOR', when treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cleavage. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, but I don't think that fits the IR data.

So let me look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are: 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or an alkyne. Wait, alkyne C-H stretches are around 3300, but the 3400-2500 is a broad range, so maybe it's an O-H stretch. Then, 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches.

So combining that, IR suggests presence of a carbonyl group, aromatic ring, and maybe an O-H group. So perhaps a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid derivative. Or maybe an ester, but the 1720 could fit as well.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong singlet, likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be a broad peak, but at 10.5, which is higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have their protons around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. But wait, in the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs). That could be a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually a bit upfield, maybe 9-10, but that's variable. Hmm.

Wait, another option: if this is a ketone, then the 10.5 might not fit. So the 10.5 is probably the -OH of a carboxylic acid, but wait, the IR data shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, which fits. So 1720 is a bit higher, so perhaps it's an ester or maybe an acid. Alternatively, maybe a ketone.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 is a singlet, broad. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, yes. So this might mean it's a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two sets of doublets, likely para-substituted aromatic protons. So if it's a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions, that would explain this. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the protons on either side would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring (like a para-substituted benzoic acid), perhaps with another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH next to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. Or perhaps a CH in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating two protons. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a branch.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H (d is doublet?), but the integration is 3H. So this might be a CH3 group attached to a CH or another group. Like a methyl adjacent to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain or a longer chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid with substituents, and some branching in the alkyl chain attached.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So in para positions, perhaps there's a substituent that's a methyl group and another group. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carb
