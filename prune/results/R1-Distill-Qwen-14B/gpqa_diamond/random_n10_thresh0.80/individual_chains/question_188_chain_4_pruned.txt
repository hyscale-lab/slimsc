Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I remember that this is calculated using something called the Bragg's law or maybe the interplanar spacing formula.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance (d) is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... some terms involving the angles). Oh wait, no, I think for a cubic system, it's simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So I need to adjust the formula for the rhombohedral structure.

Right, for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h² + k² + l²) * (1 - cos α) / (1 + cos α) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, another approach I remember is using the relation involving the reciprocal lattice. Or perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another thought. The interplanar distance formula for any crystal system can be derived from the Miller indices and the crystallographic directions.
