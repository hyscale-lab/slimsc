Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, no. Wait a second. The wave function being zero outside the region doesn't directly apply here because the wave function is given, and the condition is about where the particles are found. So, I think the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Or maybe the wave function is zero beyond that range, but the given expression is in the region where it can exist. Hmm, maybe the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. So, the wave function they provided is for the region between 1 and 3, but they didn't specify that it's zero outside. Oh, wait, the problem says that when measuring, particles are only found between 1 and 3. So, that suggests that the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So, the given wave function must be valid for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, that's the expression for the part where the particle exists. So, perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, but in between, it's this expression. But wait, wait, the wave function is a function of x, so maybe in this case, the wave function is non-zero between 1 and 3. So, the given function is applicable in that region.

But the question is about normalization. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So, the integral of |psi|^2 dx from x= -infinity to +infinity must equal 1. But since the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, the integral simplifies to the integral from 1 to 3 of |psi(x)|^2 dx equals 1.

So, the wave function is psi(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, the expression given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, where i is the square root of -1. So, that's a complex function. So, the wave function is complex, which is fine. But when calculating the probability density, I need to take the modulus squared of psi.

So, |psi(x)|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i]^2? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, when you have a complex number like (a + ib), the modulus squared is (a + ib)(a - ib) = a^2 + b^2. So, in this case, psi(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the complex conjugate would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So, |psi|^2 is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So, |psi(x)|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1 because the wave function is normalized.

So, the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me compute this integral. First, break it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C.

So, the first part becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because from x=1: 1+1=2, x=3: 1+3=4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2)=ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) =0.25 *2= 0.5.

So, the entire equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5
a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute this numerically. Let's compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So, 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So, a² ≈ 0.7213. Then, a is the square root of that. sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) 0.85.

Wait, the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So, 0.849 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle must equal 1, which implies:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:

\[
a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx \): This is straightforward:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest value to \( 0.849 \) among the options is \( 0.85 \).
