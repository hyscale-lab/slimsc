Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 

Converting to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So the uncertainties are about 7e-7 eV and 7e-8 eV for E1 and E2, respectively.

Wait, but when we talk about the energy difference between E1 and E2, we need to consider the sum of their uncertainties so that the difference is significantly larger than the combined uncertainty. So the minimum energy difference ΔE needed is roughly ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's add them: 7e-7 eV + 7e-8 eV = 7.7e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be more than about 8e-7 eV to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options, let's check each one:

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001 e-7 eV. That's way smaller than what we need.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, which is even smaller. No way that's big enough.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.001 of 0.1 eV. That's way larger than our required 8e-7 eV. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7 eV. That's about 0.1 times our required 0.8e-6 eV. Wait, no, wait: our required was about 7.7e-7, which is 0.77e-6. So 1e-8 is 0.01e-7 eV, which is 0.00001 eV. Hmm, that's still too small.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the uncertainties.

Wait, for state 1: Δt is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / Δt = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 6.59e-7 eV. So about 6.6e-7 eV.

Similarly for state 2, 1e-8 s: 1.055e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.055e-26 J = 6.59e-8 eV.

So sum of uncertainties is about 6.6e-7 + 6.6e-8 = approximately 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be bigger than this sum, like 7.26e-7 eV or higher.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger (1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 * 1e6 meV = 100 meV, way larger than 7e-7 eV, which is about 0.0007 meV). So that's way larger than needed.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-7 eV, which is 0.00001 eV. That's smaller than the required 0.0007 eV. So D is too small.

But wait, perhaps the formula is E ~ ħ/(2Δt). Oh wait, because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be approximately ħ/(2Δt). Hmm, so maybe my earlier calculation should have a factor of 2.

Let me recalculate with that in mind.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ/(2 Δt1) = (1.055e-34)/(2 * 1e-9) = ~5.275e-25 J.

Which is 5.275e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-6 eV.

Wait, that's 3.29e-6 eV. Similarly for state 2:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * Δt2) = (1.055e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) = 5.275e-27 J.

Which is 5.275e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.29e-6 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.323e-6 eV.

So the required ΔE should be larger than ~3.3e-6 eV, which is 3.3e-6 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger (1e-4 is 1e-4, 3.3e-6 is 0.0033e-4). So yes, 1e-4 is way larger than needed.

Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00001e-4, way smaller.

So the only option that is larger than the sum (3.3e-6 eV) is C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way above 3e-6 eV. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but maybe I got the approach wrong. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So I think the correct approach is that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.

So, the way to think is that each state has an uncertainty in energy (ΔE1 and ΔE2), and the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2 for them to be distinguishable.

So using the correct formula with the factor of 2, we have ΔE1 = 3.29e-6 eV and ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 3.3e-6 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than this.

Looking at the options, only option C is larger than that. So the answer should be C.


To determine whether two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) can be clearly distinguished, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For distinguishability, the energy difference between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2,
\]

where \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \) are the uncertainties for the two states. Using the formula \( \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t} \), we calculate:

1. For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The total uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.32 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the energy difference between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly resolved, it must be larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.32 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and is not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.32 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.32 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
