Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What's the major product?

Hmm, I remember that when dienes react with something like maleic anhydride, it's probably a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. Right, so the diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is maleic anhydride.

Wait, but the diene is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. So the structure of cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Wait no, wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, right? So it's a conjugated diene. Oh, but it's a ring, so it's a cyclopentadiene. But wait, the numbering is 1,3, so is that possible? Let me think. Oh, right, in a five-membered ring, the positions 1,3 would be adjacent to each other. Wait, no, let's draw it.

Cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making the structure a conjugated diene. So it's like a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but I think in reality, it's a conjugated diene with a single double bond? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait, I'm confusing something. No, cyclopentadiene usually refers to 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has a single conjugated diene systemâ€”so the ring is five-membered with two double bonds? No, wait, a five-membered ring can have only one conjugated diene, like 1,3-diene. Because 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond would require four consecutive carbons, but a five-membered ring only has five, so that can't be. So wait, maybe it's a single double bond,
