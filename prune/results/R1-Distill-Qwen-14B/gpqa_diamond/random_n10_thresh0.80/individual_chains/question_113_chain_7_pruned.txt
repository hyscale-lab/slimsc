Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me some spectroscopic data for an unknown compound and asks me to determine its chemical formula from the options provided. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, maybe this compound has an alcohol group (-OH) or a carboxylic acid group. The presence of a broad peak often suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in O-H groups.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Wait, sometimes conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl (like in an aromatic ester or an acid) can show lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen. So it's more likely a conjugated carbonyl.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: there are several peaks, including some vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That means there's a C=C somewhere.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, m/z 45. What fragments have a mass of 45? Let's think about common fragments. For example, the methyl group (CH3) is 15, but 45 is three times that, so maybe (CH3)3? No, that's 45? Wait, (CH3)3+ would be 45. Or maybe a carbonyl group. Alternatively, the fragment could be something like C3H7O or similar. Wait, 45 is 45. Let's calculate the molecular weight based on the options and see which fragment would make sense.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2 → molecular weight is (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) → 72 +12 +32= 116
B) C6H10O → (72)+(10)+(16)=98
C) C6H10O2 → 72+10+32=114
D) C6H12O → 72+12+16=100

The mass spectrum fragment is at 45, which is about 45 g/mol. So looking for a fragment with a mass of 45. Let's see what each option's possible fragments might be.

If the molecular ion is at say 116 (option A), a fragment losing 71 (maybe COO-) would give 45? Or perhaps a CH3 group from somewhere. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let me think about the functional groups.

The FTIR has a broad peak, so an O-H group. Then a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has both an -OH and a carbonyl group. That could be a carboxylic acid, but the IR of a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which fits. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm⁻¹. But wait, another peak at 1650. Could that be the O-H bend? No, I think the O-H bend is usually around 600-700 cm⁻¹. Maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester. Or perhaps it's an acid derivative.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, like something with a benzene ring and an ester group. Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

Let me consider the possible structures. For the formula, let's think about degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, DoU = (2C + 2 - H - O)/2.

Let me calculate DoU for each option:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X=0 and N=0 here.

Wait, correct formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for A:

2*6=12, +2=14. H=12. X=0. N=0. So 14-12=2. 2/2 =1 DoU. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and possibly a carbonyl group (another double bond). So maybe two DoU. Let me check for each option.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU: (12 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoU. That could mean a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (12+2-10-0)/2 = same as above, 2 DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (12+2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1 DoU.

Wait, but from the question, the compound has a vinyl group (so a double bond) and a carbonyl group (another double bond) if it's a ketone, aldehyde, etc. So that's two DoU. So the correct options should have DoU=2 or more.

Wait, looking again:

Option B: DoU=2.

Option C: DoU=2.

Options D: DoU=1.

Option A: DoU=1.

So the compound must have two DoU. So the possible options are B and C.

Wait, but wait, the options are A: C6H12O2 (DoU=1), B: C6H10O (DoU=2), C: C6H10O2 (DoU=2), D: C6H12O (DoU=1).

So the compound must have two DoU, so options B and C are possible.

Now, back to the data. The IR has a broad peak
