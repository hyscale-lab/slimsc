Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges, electrostatic potential energy is a key concept here.

Alright, let me read the question again. There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, electrons have charge e, so these are like twice that. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is that one charge is at point P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. I think this has to do with the potential energy between all the charges. Since the system is isolated, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Oh right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, it simplifies a bit.

So let's break it down. There are two groups here: the charge at P and the 12 charges at 2 meters. Also, I need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

First, the energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges. Since each charge is 2e, the product q1*q2 would be (2e)*(2e) = 4e² for each pair. But wait, the charge at P is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is interacting with it. So the energy for each such pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. Since there are 12 such pairs, I multiply by 12.

Wait, no, wait. The charge at P is fixed and each of the 12 is at 2m. So each pair (P and each charge) contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. But wait, no, actually, it's (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r, where r is 2m. So each of the 12 contributes (k * 4e²) / (2) meters. Since there are 12,
