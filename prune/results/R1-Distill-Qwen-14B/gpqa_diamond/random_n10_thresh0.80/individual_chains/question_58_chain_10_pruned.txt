Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergent integrals.

The options given are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate because it's a theory of quantum gravity. Wait, but does it need regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. From what I recall, string theory claims to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Oh right, because in string theory, interactions are calculated as sums over strings rather than point particles, which might avoid some of the usual divergences. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's already finite at high energies.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases at high energies. But wait, does it require regularization? I think QCD loops can lead to divergences, so renormalization is needed. Regularization is part of the renormalization process to handle these infinities. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED does have issues with divergences in loop calculations. For example, the electron self-energy has divergent parts. So regularization methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization are used. Hence, QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, right? Classical theories don't deal with quantum divergences because they don't involve the same mathematical framework. In classical electrodynamics, you don't have things like infinities arising from point charges or self-interactions in the same way. Wait, but the classical theory does have issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. However, when you quantize it, you get QED, which needs regularization. But the question is about whether the theory ever requires regularization. Since classical ED isn't a quantum theory, it doesn't use regularization techniques. So does that mean it's the correct answer?

Wait, but the question is which theory "never requires" regularization. So which of these theories don't use regularization because they don't have the divergences that require it?

Superstring theory, if it's finite, doesn't need regularization. But wait, I might be wrong. Do string theories actually require any form of regularization? I think they might not because their perturbative expansions are better behaved. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some may argue that superstring theory is still a work in progress, but the premise is that it's a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same divergences.

On the other hand, classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But the question is about physical theories that don't require regularization at high energies. So in the quantum realm, the problem of divergences arises, which leads to the need for regularization. But in
