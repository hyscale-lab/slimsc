Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound is reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several signals:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. Triplet and around 9.7 ppm... That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with another proton.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet of 2H. This might be aromatic protons. If it's a doublet, maybe it's part of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted rings, each proton has two adjacent protons, but in a doublet, it's coupled with one neighbor. Wait, no, para substitution would have each proton as a singlet if it's a single substituent. Hmm, maybe it's part of a di-substituted ring, like ortho or meta. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with another set of protons. Or perhaps it's part of a coupling with a neighboring group.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet of 2H. So maybe this is another set of aromatic protons adjacent to substituents. Maybe a di-substituted benzene ring where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Or perhaps it's a coupling with a different group.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet might indicate exchange with something, like an -OH proton. But wait, the integral is 2H, which doesn't fit for a single -OH group. Alternatively, could these be protons from a conjugated system, like an enol structure? Or perhaps they are next to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Wait, the molecular formula has an N, so maybe some amide or something, but that doesn't fit with the NMR signals.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet of 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Because in an -OCH2- structure, the protons would be split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has two aromatic rings connected via a chain, with an aldehyde group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure based on the NMR.

The aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde group. Then, the two doublets in the aromatic region (6.98 and 6.51) could indicate two para-substituted phenyl groups. But wait, the integral for each is 2H, so perhaps two separate aromatic groups, each with two protons?

Wait, wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO.

So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So:

Degrees = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 - 9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees: that's one ring (from benzene, which has 3), and two double bonds or rings. Hmm, but benzene has three degrees, so in C8H9NO, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring and a double bond (like an enal) plus maybe some substituents.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's think of possible structures.

Looking at the NMR, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests an OCH2 group. So maybe there's an ether or an ester or something like that.

The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm is probably at one end. Then, perhaps the structure is an aldehyde attached to a chain that includes an OCH2 group, which is connected to another group.

Wait, the NMR also shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Wait, no, the triplet is for 1H. So that's the aldehyde proton.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is an enamine or an aldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, let's think about the reaction steps. The compound is first treated with NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization of an aromatic amine, but wait, the molecular formula has N. Alternatively, it's used for the nitrous acid reaction, perhaps for a substitution or a coupling.

Wait, but wait. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → Diazotization, maybe.

2. H2O → Hydrolysis?

3. Aqueous KOH and heat → Maybe some kind of elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the initial compound has an N. So perhaps it's an aromatic amine, but then after nitrous acid, it's converted into a diazonium salt, which might undergo some reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H). Maybe that's an enol proton? Or perhaps some other protons next to oxygen.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Let me see.

Option D: Structure is an aldehyde (but-3-enal) with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached at position 4. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO? Wait, no, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO? No, but the position would be between carbons 3 and 4, but but has four carbons.

Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CHCH2CHO but the double bond is between C3 and C4? No, wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH₂-CHO but that can’t be right because butaldehyde is CH3CH2CH2CHO. Wait, let me correct.

Butanal is CH3(CH2)2CHO. But but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CHO, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CHO. But how does that fit the molecular formula?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps the compound is a substituted cinnamaldehyde or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is something like p-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the structure. The aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm, so that's an aldehyde group, CHO.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) suggests an OCH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO.

But that would be 4-phenylbut-3-enal? No, wait, but that would have a chain. Wait, another possibility is a diphenyl compound. Let me think.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each being 2H suggests two substituents on a benzene ring, each as para to each other or adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound, like two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where an aldehyde is attached to a chain with an OCH2 group, which in turn is attached to another aromatic ring.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again.

The aldehyde proton is a triplet. Wait, no, the 9.72 is a triplet integrating for 1H. So maybe it's coupled with two other protons. Wait, that's unusual for an aldehyde proton. Typically, aldehyde protons don't have many neighbors because they're at the end. Unless the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system where the proton can couple with another proton, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond, which would make the proton a triplet if it's coupled with two equivalent protons. Or maybe it's an AB system.

Wait, the triplet (t) with 1H. So maybe the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group that's part of a double bond. For example, R-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't explain coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond, like CH2=CH-CHO. But that would make the aldehyde proton a triplet, as it's coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, but if it's CH2=CH-CHO, the aldehyde proton would couple with the CH2 which is adjacent, but in that structure, the aldehyde is at the end of the double bond, as in propenal (acrolein). In that case, the aldehyde proton is a triplet because it's adjacent to the double bond's CH2 group. That makes sense.

So, the structure might have a conjugated system with an aldehyde group.

Now, the 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet could be due to exchange, like an -OH group, but for 2H, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, it could be protons
