Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's see. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B reagents.

Wait, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's something like a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the nucleophilic addition to ketones. So for the first part, butan-2-one is a ketone. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the reaction is probably forming a cyanohydrin. That's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile, like HCN or NaCN, in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh yeah, the acid helps to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So the first step uses NaCN and A. The A must be an acid. Because the reaction of ketones with NaCN typically needs an acid catalyst. So A is probably H3O+ or maybe something else. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- ions. Oh, but I thought that HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+.

So for the first reaction, adding NaCN and acid would form the cyanohydrin. So A is H3O+ in options A and B. But wait, sometimes in such reactions, you can use something else as the acid. Like maybe some other acid, but the options here don't have that. So A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, what's the second reaction? The product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. So starting from a nitrile, perhaps undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. Oh yes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

The second reagent B is used with water. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, what are the conditions? I think it's acidic hydrolysis, typically with H2SO4 and heat, but the options here have B as either HCl, CH3COOH, or maybe NaHSO3. Wait, another thought: another possibility is using a strong acid like HCl. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis is done in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Alternatively, I remember that the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with strong acid and heat. So if the starting material is a nitrile, adding H2O and HCl (as a catalyst) would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but sometimes in the presence of a strong acid and water, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. So B could be HCl.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, if the reagent A is H3O+, then it's the acid needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So that would fit. Then for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

But wait, what's the exact condition for the hydrolysis of nitriles? I think it can be done with concentrated H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, with HCl, or another strong acid. Wait, when you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you need strong acidic conditions, right? So HCl would be a suitable reagent for that. So B would be HCl.

So if in option A, B is HCl, that would make sense. So the second reaction uses HCl as the acid, which is strong enough to protonate the nitrile and facilitate the hydrolysis.

Wait, but another thought: What if the second reaction is using a different acid? For example, sometimes for hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or acids, you might use H2O with an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis is under basic conditions, but that would give a different product.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it must be under acidic conditions. So the second reaction is probably acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

So, putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second reaction uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

But wait, let me double-check the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. When that nitrile undergoes hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So under acidic conditions, the nitrile would add water and eventually form the acid.

So reagent B would be HCl. So option A's B is HCl.

Wait, but what about the other options. Option C has A as NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I think NaHSO3 is used as a sulfonic acid, but in the context of reactions, it's sometimes used as a mild reducing agent. Or, wait, no, in the presence of carbonyl groups, NaHSO3 is used to form bisulfite adducts, but I'm not sure if it's used as an acid catalyst here.

Wait, but the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. For that, you need an acid catalyst, which could be H3O+ or perhaps H2SO4 (which is a strong acid). Alternatively, could NaHSO3 act as an acid catalyst? Well, the HSO3^- ion is a weaker acid than H3O+ (pKa around 1.99), but it's still acidic. So perhaps if A is NaHSO3, it could provide H+ ions to protonate the carbonyl.

Wait, but what's the source of H+ when using NaHSO3? NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- can act as a base, but under acidic conditions, it can donate a proton. So maybe in the presence of more acid, like when H3O+ is present, but if A is just NaHSO3, perhaps that acid is enough.

Wait, but in the first reaction, when you add NaCN and an acid, the acid should be a strong one to protonate the carbonyl. I think H3O+ is a stronger acid than HSO3^-.

Wait, the pKa of H3O+ is about 0, while HSO3^- has a pKa around 1.99. So if you have a weaker acid as the catalyst, maybe it's not strong enough to protonate the carbonyl of the ketone sufficiently. Because ketones are less reactive than aldehydes, so maybe a stronger acid is needed. So perhaps H3O+ is better for the first reaction.

So then, for the first reaction, A is H3O+, so options A or B. Then, for the second reaction, B would be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

Wait, but what's the role of B in the second reaction? The second reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the conditions are H2O and B. So if B is HCl, it's a strong acid. If B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, would that be sufficient?

Wait, sometimes nitrile hydrolysis is done with H2O and H2SO4, which is a strong acid. Alternatively, using HCl as the catalyst would work. But if B is just acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a weak acid, would that be enough to drive the hydrolysis? I'm not sure. Maybe for that, a stronger acid is needed.

So, looking back, the second reaction uses B as HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). So if B is HCl, then option A would be correct.

But wait, another angle: in the first reaction, butan-2-one is a ketone. When you form a cyanohydrin, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That suggests that the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the proton is added from the acid. So the acid is necessary to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So, for the first step, the reagent A is the acid. So A is H3O+ in options A and B.

Now, for the second step, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So that would require hydrolysis.

Wait, another way to think about it: in the second reaction, the nitrile (-C≡N) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the nitrile is first hydrated to an amide, then further hydrolyzed to the acid.

I think the typical reagent for this is H2O with an acid catalyst, often HCl. So for the second step, B is HCl.

So that would make the correct option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A says A is H3O+, B is HCl. Yes.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions, we analyze the mechanisms and conditions required for each step:

### Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, a nucleophilic addition of cyanide (CN⁻) to a ketone. For this reaction to occur, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and allowing CN⁻ to attack. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable catalyst for this reaction, as it effectively facilitates the protonation of the ketone. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO₃) is less likely to provide sufficient acidity for this step, as its conjugate acid (HSO₃⁻) has a higher pKa (~1.99) compared to H₃O⁺ (pKa ~0).

### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires acidic conditions to facilitate the addition of water and subsequent transformations. Among the options, **HCl** is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides strong acidic conditions necessary for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and may not provide sufficient acidity to drive the reaction efficiently.

### Evaluation of Options  
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction as an acid catalyst.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction as a strong acid for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is consistent with the requirements of both reactions.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and may not efficiently catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.  
  - This option is less likely to work for the second reaction.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is less acidic than H₃O⁺ and may not effectively catalyze the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - This option is less likely to work for the first reaction.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is less acidic than H₃O⁺ and may not effectively catalyze the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and may not efficiently catalyze the nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.  
  - This option is unlikely to work for either reaction.  

### Conclusion  
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, as provided in **Option A**.
