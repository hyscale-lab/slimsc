Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to characterize it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests there's a double bond somewhere. The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. The options are four different formulas, all C6H something O, possibly with an extra O.

First, I'll break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is likely O-H stretch. Broad usually means hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. Let me think: 1700 is indicative of carbonyl groups. For example, ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids, etc. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Maybe another carbonyl, like an ester or an amide? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or maybe an aromatic ring nearby. Wait, but if there are two carbonyl groups, that would mean two oxygen-containing functional groups with C=O.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens—so there's a double bond. That could mean an alkene. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Looking at the options, all are C6. Let's see the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

For each option:

A: C=6, H=12, O=2. So (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree—could be a ring or double bond.

B: C=6, H=10, O=1. (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. Maybe a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

C: C=6, H=10, O=2. (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

D: C=6, H=12, O=1. (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

The problem mentions vinyl hydrogens in NMR—vinyl is CH2=CH- or similar, so that's a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond.

If the O-H is present, that's another group. Let's think about possible structures.

FTIR also shows 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Two carbonyls. So either two different carbonyl groups or perhaps a conjugated system.

Wait, if the two carbonyl peaks are close, maybe it's a conjugated system. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Like a ketone adjacent to a double bond. Alternatively, maybe two different carbonyls, like a ketone and an ester or something.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an amide or another conjugated carbonyl. But the problem doesn't mention amide protons in NMR, so maybe not amide.

Wait, also, the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H. So if there's an O-H, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have O-H as well, but their IR peaks are usually broader, maybe even around 2500-3300 with a very broad peak. But in this case, the peak is very broad and at 3000, which could fit. But the presence of two carbonyls could mean something else. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have both an O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700 cm^-1). But in this problem, there are two peaks at 1700 and 1650. So two carbonyls.

Hmm. Maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups. So, possible structures could be something like an ester (which has a carbonyl) and another carbonyl, like a ketone. Or maybe an acid and an ester.

But wait, the molecular formulas—let me look at the options again. Let's consider the molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. The degree of unsaturation is 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which is a double bond, that accounts for one degree. So the other degree could be a ring or another double bond.

If the compound has a double bond and a ring, that could fit. Or maybe another carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But that would have O in ester group and the ring. Alternatively, a diester with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe something like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. The carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond could cause the other peak around 1650. Or maybe the carbonyl and an aromatic ring (but then the IR would show different peaks for aromatic C=C).

Wait, aromatic rings typically have absorbance around 1500-1450 and 1600 cm^-1 for the C=C stretching. The 1650 peak is a bit higher, maybe indicating a conjugated carbonyl.

So an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone would have the ketone at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) could have a peak in the 1650 region. That makes sense. So the IR would show two peaks: 1700 for the C=O, and 1650 for the conjugated C=C.

So then, the O-H in the IR is a broad peak around 3000. Wait, but in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, where is the O-H? Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. If the compound is a ketone with a conjugated double bond, but no O-H, then the broad peak wouldn't fit. So maybe the O-H is from an alcohol or another functional group.

Wait, maybe the structure is an enol. Enols have both O-H and conjugated double bonds. Enols would have O-H stretch around 3300 (maybe broader), but in our case, it's a broad peak at 3000. Hmm, could that be?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound with both an alcohol group and a conjugated carbonyl. For example, something like a vinyl alcohol (but vinyl alcohol is unstable, so maybe as part of a larger structure). Or an allyl alcohol derivative with a ketone.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

If the compound has two carbonyl groups (as suggested by IR), then the formula would have two O in the functional groups. Let's see which options have O=2.

Options A is C6H12O2, O=2.

Option C is C6H10O2, O=2.

So the other two, B and D, have O=1. So if the IR shows two carbonyls, then the formula must have two O in the molecule. So that would narrow it down to A and C.

So between A and C.

Now, the degree of unsaturation:

For option A: C6H12O2. Degrees: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So if the formula has one degree, but we have a double bond, that would mean the other degree is a ring. So the structure would have one double bond (from vinyl) and one ring. For example, cyclohexenol something. Or perhaps an ester with a ring and a double bond.

Wait, but let me think about option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But if the compound has two carbonyl groups, perhaps two double bonds? Or a ring and a double bond.

But another consideration is the mass spec. The fragment peak at m/z=45. 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2O (45 g/mol, but that's 45?), wait, wait: 45 is also the mass of C3H7O? Or perhaps, more accurately, the mass of (CH3)2CO (acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58, but wait, 45 is less than that. Hmm. Maybe a fragment like CH2O (formaldehyde? But that's 30). Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a common one like (CH2O) or something else.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of a CH3CO group. Let me calculate: CH3CO is 2*12 + 3*1 (from CH3) + 16 (O) = 24 +3 +16=43? Hmm, not 45. Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of molecular fragments. For example, a fragment like C3H7O would be 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. No. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CHO group (acrolein) would have a molecular ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The most abundant fragment in mass spec is often the molecular ion, but not
