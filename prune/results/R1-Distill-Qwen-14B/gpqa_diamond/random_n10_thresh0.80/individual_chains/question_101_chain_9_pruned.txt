Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with compound A in an acid-catalyzed reaction, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what A and the catalyst B are from the options given.

First, I should probably sketch out the structures involved. I remember that pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, so 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of that ring. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let's break that down: the cyclohexylidenemethyl part would be a substituted cyclohexane ring attached to the pyrrolidine. Specifically, cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexene ring (so with a double bond) attached via a methylene group (CH₂).

Hmm, so the product looks like the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent where the cyclohexene ring is connected via a CH₂ group. So the reaction probably forms a new ring or a new substituent.

What kind of reaction forms a cyclohexene ring attached this way? Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of addition. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution or an alkylation. Or maybe an aldol reaction or something else.

Wait, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Acid catalysts are often used in reactions like esterifications, alkylation, acylation, or maybe even some elimination reactions. But in this case, the product seems to involve a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, another thought. The product has a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. The starting material is a cyclic amine. So perhaps this is a case of the pyrrolidine ring undergoing some kind of ring expansion or substitution where a new group is added.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the pyrrolidine acting as a nucleophile. Wait, could it be a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That makes me think
