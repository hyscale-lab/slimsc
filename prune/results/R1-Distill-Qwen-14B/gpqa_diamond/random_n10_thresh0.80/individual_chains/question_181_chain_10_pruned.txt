Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production has different processes, like the proton-proton chain, and there are different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, I think. So, if this branch stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux we receive on Earth?

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux in these bands would change when the pp-III branch stops.

First, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. The main proton-proton chain (pp-I) produces helium by fusing protons, and then there are side branches. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a carbon-13 nucleus, right? This process produces a nitrogen-13, which then decays into a carbon-13, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, but neutrinos in the Sun... the main neutrinos are from the pp-I and the CNO cycles, I think.

Wait, no, the main neutrinos are from the decay of Beryllium-7 in the pp chain. Let me get that right. The pp-I process creates Be-7, which then captures a proton to form two Li-7 nuclei, each of which emits a positron and a neutrino. So these are the neutrinos that make up the majority of the solar neutrino flux.

But the pp-III branch—I think it's another part of the pp chain. In the pp-III branch, a proton fuses with a C-13 nucleus to form N-13, which then decays into C-13, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So that's another source of neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then that specific source of neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So other branches, like pp-I and the CNO cycle, are still happening.

Now, neutrinos from the pp-III branch: what energies do they have? The neutrinos from the decay of Be-7 in the pp-I process have a lower energy, around 0.4 MeV or so. But the pp-III branch's neutrinos—since they come from the decay of N-13, which has a longer half-life than Be-7, wait, no, Be-7 has a half-life of about 53 days, while N-13's half-life is about 10 minutes. So the neutrinos from N-13 decay would have higher energies? Or wait, the energy of the neutrinos depends on the decay process. Let me think: in the decay of N-13 → C-13 + e+ + ν, the emitted positron and neutrino. The energy distribution would depend on the decay scheme. Be-7 decay emits a positron with low energy, I think, because the mass difference is low. But for N-13, the mass difference is bigger, so the emitted positron has higher energy, and thus the neutrino energy is higher as well.

Wait, but the neutrino energy in Be-7 decay is about 0.4 MeV, while in N-13 decay, it's higher, maybe around 1.5 MeV or so? I'm not exactly sure, but let's say that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy than those from the main pp-I branch.

So the problem is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. That's the approximate time it takes for neutrinos to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, the neutrinos emitted before the branch stopped would still be on their way, but any neutrinos produced after the branch stopped (i.e., after 8.5 minutes ago) won't be coming from that source.

Wait, but the neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach us. So if the pp-
