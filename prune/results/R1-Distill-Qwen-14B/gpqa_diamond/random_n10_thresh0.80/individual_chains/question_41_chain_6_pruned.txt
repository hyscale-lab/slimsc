Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Hmm, right. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light inside it is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. I remember that in optics, the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed relative to the medium. But here, the medium itself is moving relative to the lab frame, so I need to consider how the movement of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

I think this has to do with the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh wait, but the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so maybe it's using c=1 for simplicity. But wait, no, in this case, the light is in the glass, which has index n. So the speed of the light in the glass is v_light = c/n, but wait, c is 1, so v_light = 1/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So, from the lab frame, what's the observed speed of the light? Oh right, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait,
