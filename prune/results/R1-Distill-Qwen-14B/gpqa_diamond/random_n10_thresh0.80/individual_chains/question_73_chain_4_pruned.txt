Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we've got two astronauts, right? Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity of the faster one with respect to the slower one would be v1 - v2 divided by (1 - v1 v2 / c²).

Wait, wait, but wait. In this case, the first astronaut (2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. So, from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is moving at 0.1c, I think. Or wait, is it the other way around? Because velocity addition is not symmetric. Let me think.

Wait, the relative speed v_rel is calculated as (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So plugging in v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. So that would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. So that's one part done. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that narrows it down.

Now the total energy of the system. Oh, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for each, I need to compute gamma for their respective velocities and then multiply by their masses.

Wait, but wait. The first astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. The second is 3m at 0.5c. So I'll compute each gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for astronaut 1: gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait, no, energy is gamma * mass * c². So astronaut 1: 2m * gamma1 * c². Wait, no, wait. Gamma is a factor; the energy is (gamma) * (rest mass energy). So for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma1 * (2m) * c².

Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass energy is m c². So for astronaut 1, rest mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Wait, no no, no. Wait, the mass is 2m, so the rest energy is (2m) c². Then, with gamma, it's gamma times rest energy.

So E1 = gamma1 * (2m c²).

Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * (3m c²).

Compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Gamma1: v1 = 0.6c. So (1 - (0.
