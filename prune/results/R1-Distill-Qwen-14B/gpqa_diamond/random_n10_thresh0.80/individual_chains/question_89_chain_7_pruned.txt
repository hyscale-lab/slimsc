Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on the first and third carbons of the adamantane structure. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they typically undergo elimination reactions. Wait, but since it's a dihalide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Oh right, but wait, in the case of vicinal dihalides (halogens on adjacent carbons), elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. So maybe it's not a simple E2 elimination. Hmm, or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, they might undergo a double elimination. Let me think... Oh! Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or a similar process. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, wait, that usually requires more specific conditions.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid, which is formed when dibromides react with KOH. Another possibility is that the bromides are undergoing a substitution reaction. But with KOH and heat, elimination is more likely. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. In adamantane, the bridgehead carbons can't have double bonds because of the structure. So if elimination occurs, maybe forming a conjugated diene? Or perhaps a cyclopropane? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So the product after treatment with KOH must have a carbonyl. So that suggests that the bromides are being oxidized or that elimination leads to a ketone.

Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination with loss
