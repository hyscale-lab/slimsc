Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this particle physics problem. Alright, let's take it step by step.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, right, so this looks like an interaction term where the boson X is coupling to some fermions. The fermion fields ψf probably represent different types of fermions, maybe quarks or leptons.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV, because energy and momentum conservation require that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Oh wait, but also considering that the decay products need to have enough energy to move, so the sum must be strictly less than 6 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, they list various possible decay channels. I think the key is to identify which fermion pairs can be produced by X, given the mass limit.

First, let's recall the masses of the known fermions. The fermions are quarks and leptons. Let's list their masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV (so negligible for this purpose)
- Down quark (d): around 5 MeV (also negligible)
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV (like 0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV (so 4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV. But wait, the X is only 6 GeV, so t is way out.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, so probably not relevant here.

So, the decay products must be fermion-antifermion pairs where each fermion's mass is less than 6 GeV/2 = 3 GeV. Because each fermion's mass is m, and for a pair, it's 2m. So 2m < 6 GeV → m <3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. The rest mass energy of the pair is 2m_fermion. So for X to decay into a pair, 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. So m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

- u: 2 MeV → okay, but their mass is negligible. So uū is possible.
- d: 5 MeV → same, but their decay is possible.
- s: 100 MeV → okay.
- c: 1.5 GeV → 2*1.5 = 3 GeV which is equal to
