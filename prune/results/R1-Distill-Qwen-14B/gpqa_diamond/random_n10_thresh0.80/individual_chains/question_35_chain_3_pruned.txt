Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And the matrix S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum, the components are represented by these Pauli matrices scaled by some constants. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons. The spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz are proportional to the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz.

So S in this case must be the Pauli y-matrix multiplied by something. Let me check. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly what S is here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

Then, Ay = c * S. So substituting c = h/(4π), we have Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are known. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because σy^2 is identity, so eigenvalues squared are 1, so eigenvalues are ±1.

So Ay's eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). That would be ±h/(4π). Because when you multiply the matrix by a scalar, the eigenvalues just get scaled by that factor.

Wait, looking at the options. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because eigenvalues for Ay should be real? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is a Hermitian matrix because it's the spin operator, which is Hermitian. So Ay, being c times S, is also Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real. Hmm, but looking at the options, most of them involve complex eigenvalues, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The spin components are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues are real. So Ay must have
