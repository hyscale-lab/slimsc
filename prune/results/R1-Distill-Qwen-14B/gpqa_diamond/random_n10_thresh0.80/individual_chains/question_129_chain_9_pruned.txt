Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reactions are a series of steps starting from compound A and moving through B, C, D, and ending at E. There are also some hints provided, which I should pay attention to.

First, I'll list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E's IR is at 1715 cm^-1.

Options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. The IR peaks are important. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) typically absorb around 1700 cm^-1. The exact position can vary based on the environment. So, compound A has a peak at 1750, which is higher than usual. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, esters usually have higher wavenumbers than ketones because the carbonyl is more electron-withdrawing. So if A is an ester, then E is a ketone since its peak is at 1715. Or wait, maybe A is a ketone and E is something else? Let me think more.

Looking at the reaction steps:

A + HCN → B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, wait. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would add to form a cyanohydrin. Or maybe A is a carbonyl compound, like a ketone or aldehyde, and HCN adds across the carbonyl.

Wait, the first step is A → B with HCN. If A is a carbonyl, then B would be a cyanohydrin. But I should consider the structure. Let's think about the subsequent steps.

B is then reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd with H2 is usually hydrogenation. So if B is a nitrile (from HCN addition maybe?), then hydrogenation would reduce it to an amine. Or wait, maybe B is a ketone plus a cyanide group. Hmm. Alternatively, if B is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached, what would happen upon hydrogenation? Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let me think about what each reagent does. HCN adds to a carbonyl, so let me think about that. If A is a ketone, say cyclohexanone, then adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

But wait, the second step is a hydrogenation. So if B is a cyanohydrin (which has an -OH and a -CN group), then hydrogenation would probably reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, no, H2 and Pd would typically reduce nitriles to amines. Wait, but nitriles (CN) when hydrogenated in presence of Pd (like catalytic hydrogenation) typically get reduced to amines. So if B has a CN group, then C would have an NH2 group. But that doesn't align with the next step with HNO2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps B is a ketone with a cyanide substituent. Or perhaps A is something else.

Wait, let's look at the hints again. Hint a) says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. A phosphorous ylide is used in Wittig reactions. So, in Wittig reactions, aldehydes or ketones react with ylides to form alkenes.

So, if A is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone), reacting with a Wittig reagent (ylide) would form an alkene. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, looking at that structure, it's a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. The ylidene would be a CH2 group attached to a double bond. So, perhaps the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Let me imagine the structure. So, cyclopentane, with methyl groups at C1 and C2, and at C4, a substituent that is a propylidene group (like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's a substituent that's a propene group attached).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring with a double bond adjacent to substituents. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps the key point is that the Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl. So, this suggests that A is a ketone because the product is an alkene connected to the ring.

So, A is a ketone. Because in the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl (A) is converted into an alkene. So, if A is a ketone, then the product would have an alkene where the ketone was.

Wait, but back to the reaction steps. So, A is a ketone.

Step 1: A (ketone) + HCN → B.

HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin. So, B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached to the same carbon as the OH. So, if A is a cyclohexanone, then B would be cyclohexanol cyanohydrin, which would have a structure like (cyclohexyl)C(OH)(CN). But perhaps in this case, the structure is more specific.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So, what gets reduced here? Let's think. Cyanohydrin has an -OH and a -CN group. Hydrogenation would typically reduce nitriles to amines. So, the -CN group would become -CH2NH2. Wait, but in the presence of H2 and Pd, maybe the -CN group is hydrogenated to an amine. Alternatively, if the hydrogenation is partial, maybe just the nitrile to an amine.

Wait, but if B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group, then upon hydrogenation, the nitrile would become a primary amine. So, the structure would have an -NH2 group instead of CN. But wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is more of a hydrogenolysis. Alternatively, maybe the -OH group is also involved, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't affect the nitrile but affects the double bond if any. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol, so I don't think it has a double bond. So, maybe the nitrile is being hydrogenated. So, in that case, the CN group would become a CH2NH2 group. Hmm, but wait, when you hydrogenate a nitrile (R-C≡N), you typically get R-CH2-NH2. Or maybe under certain conditions, it could hydrogenate to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps using a different catalyst, like Raney Ni, you can get different products, but Pd is usually for hydrogenation of alkenes or alkynes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next step.

Step 3: Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid,
