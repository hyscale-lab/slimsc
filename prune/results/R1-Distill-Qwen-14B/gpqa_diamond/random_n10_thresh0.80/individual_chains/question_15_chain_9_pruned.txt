Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. So, the question is about transit probability of two planets, and which one is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one.

From what I remember, the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The probability formula I think goes like this: P = (R_planet / R_star)Â² multiplied by something else... Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the orbital inclination. Oh right, the transit probability is mainly determined by the alignment of the orbit. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the area. Let me think again.

I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet transits) is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, no, that's the formula for the flux change, not the probability. Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, no, I remember it's the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the star's disk. The probability is (R_planet /
