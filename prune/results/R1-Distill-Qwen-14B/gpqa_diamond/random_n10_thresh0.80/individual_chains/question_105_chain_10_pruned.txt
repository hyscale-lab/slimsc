Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view from our perspective, causing changes in brightness over time—this is the photometric time-series they're talking about. 

Now, the interesting part is that this star's brightness variation could look similar to the dip caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star. The question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would have to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness change amplitude.

So, the main goal is to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. 

Let me think about the two scenarios causing the brightness variations. 

First, when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk. Since area is πR², the fractional change is (Rpl/Rstar)². So, that's straightforward.

In the case of the star with spots, the star's brightness isn't uniform. The hemisphere with spots is darker. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then move out of view. But because only one hemisphere is spotty, does that mean that when the other hemisphere comes into view, the brightness is higher? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the star's normal brightness is with a hemisphere that's partially spotted. When it rotates, the spotted hemisphere is visible for a certain period, which would cause a dip in brightness, and then the non-spotted hemisphere would come into view, causing a rise. But wait, the question says that the star's brightness variation is similar to that of a planet. So, the amplitude of the dip when the spots are facing us should be similar to that caused by a planet.

Wait, but the star's brightness without spots would be a certain value. The spots cause a dip when they're visible. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the normal brightness (without spots) and when the spots are blocking a portion of the light.

Wait no, actually, the star's overall brightness isn't uniform because one hemisphere is spotted. So, when the star rotates, the brightness change is due to the spots becoming visible or not. But I'm not sure I'm getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness without any spots would be a certain level. When the spots are present, as the star rotates, the brightness fluctuates. The maximum brightness would occur when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty side is facing us.

But wait, the star emits the same in all directions, so when the spots are on the far side, our view is normal. But when they rotate into view, the total brightness we see decreases because those spots are cooler and thus emit less light.

Wait, so the star's brightness without spots is B0. When the spots are in our view, the brightness is lower, B = B0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4)), or something like that.

Wait, no, wait. The flux from a star is proportional to T^4. So, each point on the star's surface emits flux according to its temperature. The dark spots have a lower temperature, so they contribute less flux.

The total flux from the star when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. When the spots are on the far side, their flux doesn't contribute, so the flux is higher.

So, without any spots, the star's flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (Surface Area). But with spots, the flux when the spots are facing us is F =
