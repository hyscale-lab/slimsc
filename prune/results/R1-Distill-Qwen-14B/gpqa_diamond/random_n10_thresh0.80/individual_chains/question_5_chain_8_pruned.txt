Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum. Oh wait, maybe P is the spin operator here? Because muons are spin-1/2 particles, so their spin operator components would be relevant.

The question gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. Let me see: P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Right, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is (σ_i) * ħ/2, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the operator in question is the vector operator P. So the operator along an arbitrary direction n (which lies in the x-z plane) would be P·n. Oh, because the total operator is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane implies θ is the angle from the z-axis, and phi is 0 or 180, but doesn't matter here because direction is along x-z plane.

So the operator P_n = P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Since P_y component is multiplied by zero because n has no y-component.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the vector n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So P_n is the operator (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ). The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.
