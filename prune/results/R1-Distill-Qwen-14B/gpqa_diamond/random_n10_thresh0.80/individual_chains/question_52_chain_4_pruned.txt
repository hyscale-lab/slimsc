Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They're asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. I remember that the ratio depends on the temperatures. The Boltzmann factor equation is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the degeneracy, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the spots change the effective temperature. So, when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower. So, the observed ratio would be lower when the temperature is lower because the exponent becomes more negative, reducing the ratio n2/n1.

Wait, but wait. The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star isn't spotted, the ratio is higher. So, the factor is the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

So, the factor is (n1_not_spotted / n1_spotted) * (n2_not_spotted / n2_spotted) ? Wait, no, no. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Or is it n2/n1? Wait, the question says, 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'.

Oh, right, so the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, n1/n2 is smaller when the star has spots. That would imply that n2/n1 is larger when the star has spots, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. The ratio n1/n2 = [ (g1 exp(-E1/(kT)) ) / (g2 exp(-E2/(kT)) ) ]

Which simplifies to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponent increases, making the ratio larger. So, higher T leads to higher n1/n2 ratio.

So, when the star has spots, the effective T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 would be lower. Which aligns with the problem statement.

So, the factor we need is (n1/n2)_no_spots
