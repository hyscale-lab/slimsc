Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator Ay, which is defined as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So, Ay = c * S. Let me first write down the matrix S. That would be:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, Ay would be c multiplied by each element of S. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar but without the i. Oh wait, wait. S looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix but without the i factors—no, wait, let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. Oh, so S is σy. 

But wait, the operator in question is Ay = c * σy. Oh, but I should double-check. The problem states that S is that matrix, so that's correct.

Now, the problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute the matrix Ay first. Since c = h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

Ay = [[0, -(h/(4π))i],
      [(h/(4π))i, 0]]

So, to find the eigenvalues λ, we set up:

det(Ay - λ I) = 0

So,

| -λ      -(h/(4π))i       |
| (h/(4π))i      -λ |  = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (h/(4π))i * (h/(4π))i ] = λ² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) i^2 ]

But i squared is -1, so this becomes λ² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) (-1) ] = λ² + (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The determinant is (the product of the diagonals) minus (the product of the off-diagonals). So:

( (-λ) * (-λ) ) - ( ( - (h/(4π))i ) * ( (h/(4π))i ) ) = 0

Which is λ² - [ ( -h/(4π) i ) * ( h/(4π) i ) ]

Multiply the off-diagonal terms: (-h/(4π) i ) * (h/(4π) i ) = (-h^2/(16 π²) ) (i^2 )

And i squared is -1, so it becomes (-h^2/(16 π² )) (-1)
