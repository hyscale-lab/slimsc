Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. It's about the decay of a boson X. The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term and some options about how X can decay. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Oh right, the standard form for Yukawa interactions is something like L = -g ψ̄ ϕ ψ, where ϕ is a scalar field. So in this case, the scalar field is X, and the coupling is λf times (v + X). So the interaction couples the fermion ψ_f to the boson X.

Wait, what's the fermion here? The subscript f might indicate that it's a fermion of some type. So the interaction term implies that the boson X can interact with fermions of type f. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass. But wait, if the fermion is massless, then the condition is that the boson mass is at least twice the fermion mass. But in reality, fermions have their own masses, so we need to consider that.

So the allowed decays are to fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, m_f must be ≤3 GeV. Wait, but wait, what about the actual masses of the known fermions? Let me recall.

The known elementary fermions and their masses (approximate):

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (
