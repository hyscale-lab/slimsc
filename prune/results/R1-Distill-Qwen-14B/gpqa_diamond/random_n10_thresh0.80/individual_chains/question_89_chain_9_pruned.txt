Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. From the given NMR data, there's a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a pretty upfield shift, but considering it's after treatment with a strong base like KOH, I'm thinking maybe an elimination reaction happened here. Wait, dibromides when treated with a base usually undergo E2 elimination, forming alkenes. Oh, but wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so maybe the dihalide is on adjacent carbons, leading to a ring-opening? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond.

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So product 1 must have a ketone. Wait, but elimination usually gives alkenes. Did I mix up the steps? Or maybe after elimination, another reaction occurs. Oh wait, KOH is a strong base, and in some cases, especially if the dihalide is vicinal (like adjacent), it could form an epoxide. No, wait, epoxidation usually requires peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a formation of a diol, but that would come from hydrolysis. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's not hydrolysis but elimination followed by something else.

Wait, no, let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. The base would deprotonate and eliminate. Wait, but in a dibromide, elimination would form a double bond. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the structure is such that the elimination leads to a ketone. Oh wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a chair-like structure. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two opposite bridgeheads. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps the vicinal dihalide undergoes elimination. Vicinal dihalides under E2 elimination form alkenes. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hoffman elimination or some kind of oxidation?

Wait, KOH could also cause elimination to form an epoxide, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Oh wait, adamantane is a very stable structure, so maybe the dihalide is in a position that when treated with KOH, it forms a ketone via some kind of oxidation or elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, it might form a carbocation, but that's less likely with a strong base like KOH.

Alternatively, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible product. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR peak is a carbonyl, so maybe the singlet is a carbonyl adjacent group. Wait, a carbonyl typically has neighboring protons as a triplet or something else. Or perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would require hydrolysis of both bromides, which would give a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretch (maybe it's a ketone, not a diol).

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But epoxides don't show a carbonyl in IR. So that's not it.

Wait, thinking again: The IR peak at 1720 is a ketone. So product 1 must be a ketone. So how does a vicinal dihalide become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination followed by an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to ring opening with formation of a ketone. Wait, bridgehead elimination? Like when a bridgehead hydrogen is removed, leading to ring opening. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or something similar.

But I'm not getting it. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is probably an OCH2 group. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone with a neighboring OCH2. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the singlet is a carbonyl group with adjacent protons. But a singlet of 2H would imply that each proton has no neighboring protons, which is rare. Wait, maybe it's a methylene group next to a carbonyl, but in a symmetrical environment, so it's a singlet. For example, (CH2) next to a carbonyl where the two H's are equivalent and have no neighboring H's on the same carbon. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The product is a diketone, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon dehydrohalogenation, forms a ketone. If the elimination leads to a bridge opening, maybe the structure becomes something like adamantyl with a ketone group. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond, but also create a new carbonyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a bridge and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But with two bromides, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, the NMR peaks: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the middle region could be from the adamantane rings, perhaps as CH2 groups. The 2H at 4.79 might be from an OCH2 group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, putting this together, product 1 is likely a diol or an ether, but the IR suggests a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone or a ketone with an adjacent group.

Wait
