Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on regularization, but I'll try to think it through.

Regularity, or regularization, is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't give physically meaningful results. So regularization is a way to handle that by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the math manageable, and then you take the limit where the cutoff goes away.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do. But wait, do they still require regularization? I think in some cases, maybe during intermediate steps, you might need it, but the theory itself is supposed to be free from divergences. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization. Or maybe it's the opposite—I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. Oh right, QCD does require regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. So you need to regularize it, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or introducing a cutoff. But wait, QCD is also asymptotically free, so at high energies, the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative calculations manageable. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? No, because even asymptotically, you can get divergences in calculations which need to be handled. So I think B does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED does have divergences. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy has infinities, which are handled via renormalization. And regularization is a part of that process. So QED requires regularization. So option C requires it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same kind of infinities. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges leading to issues, but in classical treatment, you just accept things like the self-energy
