Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagent and catalyst for the reaction. Let me try to break it down. 

The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? So 3-methyl means there's a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring. Now, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, that name looks a bit complex. Let me parse it. The substituent on the pyrrolidine ring is at position 1. So that substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, what's a cyclohexylidenemethyl group? I think cyclohexylidene suggests that it's a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, like maybe cyclohexene or something similar. Oh wait, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl group. So the structure would be a methyl group connected to a cyclohexene ring. So maybe it's like (cyclohexenyl)methyl attached to the pyrrolidine.

So the reaction is acid-catalyzed. The product seems to involve some kind of ring formation or addition. Let me think about possible reactions starting with a cyclic amine like pyrrolidine. Oh, wait, maybe it's an example of a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the pyrrolidine is undergoing some kind of alkylation or acylation.

The product's substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So if I think about possible reactions, maybe it's a Wittig reaction or some kind of enamine chemistry. Because pyrrolidine is a secondary amine, maybe it's involved in forming an enamine. Enamines are typically formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes, right?

So the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. If it reacts with an aldehyde, perhaps under acid catalysis, it could form an enamine. Let me recall: the synthesis of enamines involves two steps. First, the amine reacts with a ketone or aldehyde to form a Schiff base, which is then usually dehydrated to form the enamine. Enamines are useful because they can undergo various reactions, like alkylation, and upon hydrolysis, they can yield the corresponding ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but here the reagent is compound A, and the catalyst is B. So in this reaction, 3-methylpyrrolidine is reacting with compound A under the influence of acid catalyst B to form the product.

The product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. So if the starting amine is pyrrolidine, and compound A is an aldehyde, then perhaps the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Because if that's the case, the amine would form a Schiff base with the aldehyde, and then under acid and heat, it would lose water to form an enamine. 

Wait, but the product is (cyclohexylidenemethyl)-pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene (CH
