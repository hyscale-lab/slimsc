Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying a final product after a series of reactions. The compound given has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the reagents used are NaNO2 + HCl, followed by water, and then aqueous KOH with heat. Let's break this down.

First, I'll focus on the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an aldehyde (another 1?), but let me check the NMR.

Looking at the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet integrating to 1H. A triplet in the aromatic region? Or maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But a triplet might be something else. Alternatively, an acidic proton like an aldehyde or an enol proton?

Wait, but wait. Let's look at the other peaks. 

6.98 ppm (d, 2H): That's a doublet, likely aromatic protons, which are part of a coupling system.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably another set of aromatic protons. So maybe two sets of doublets, each 2H, suggesting two substituents on a benzene ring. Like para-substituted groups.

Then, 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Maybe an enol proton or an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be some conjugated double bonds or perhaps an aldehyde or ketone adjacent to the ring. Hmm, but the aldehyde would be a tripletâ€”maybe not. Alternatively, an enol form, like in a conjugated system?

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, integrating to 2H. That's likely a CH2 group attached to something else. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. So perhaps a CH2-O group or CH2-NO2? But wait, the reagents involve nitrous acid, so maybe it's a nitro group?

Wait, the starting formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. The NMR suggests aromatic protons, maybe a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. If it's an aldehyde proton, why is it a triplet? Aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylogous aldehyde or some coupling from adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group, like an enol. Wait, if it's an enol, the proton could be next to a carbonyl. That's possible.

Alternatively, the triplet could be due to coupling with two adjacent protons. Maybe a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, but then why is the integration 1H? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: when you have an aromatic ring with substituents and a conjugated double bond, sometimes the protons on the double bond can cause splitting in adjacent protons. For example, if there's a double bond next to the ring, like in a styrene-type structure, the protons on the double bond might couple with adjacent aromatic protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triplet is from an aldehyde group adjacent
