Okay, so I've got this question here about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The pp-I branch is the main one, right? Then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, right, pp-III is a higher energy branch, involving more protons.

So, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. I think the pp-III reaction is something like 2 protons fusing into deuterium, which then fuses with another proton to make helium-3, and so on. The neutrinos come from the beta decay steps in these reactions. So if pp-III stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop too.

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the flux in these bands changes when pp-III stops.

I remember that the standard solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos in a lower energy range. The pp-III reactions are responsible for higher-energy neutrinos. Because neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, changes in the Sun's core would take time to affect the neutrino flux we detect. Since the Sun is about 8 minutes light-travel time away, stopping the pp-III process 8.5 minutes ago means that we're just now starting to see the effects of that stoppage.

So, if the pp-III branch stopped, the production of high-energy neutrinos from that branch would stop. The neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy, so that would affect the higher bands. The bands in question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So band 2 is higher energy than band 1.

Before the pp-III stopped, there were contributions from both the ongoing reactions. After the stoppage, only the ongoing reactions (like pp-I) continue to produce neutrinos. But wait, does the pp-III branch produce neutrinos in both bands, or is it more
