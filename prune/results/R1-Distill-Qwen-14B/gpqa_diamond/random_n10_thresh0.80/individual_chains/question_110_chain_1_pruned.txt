Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star needs to be brighter than 17 (so, magnitude less than 17) to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 (so magnitude less than 16) for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17, right? Wait, no, the higher the magnitude, the fainter the star. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that means stars with apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So wait, if a star's V mag is brighter than 17, meaning it's magnitude is less than 17, then ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so their V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, the exact wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Because in astronomy, a lower magnitude number means a brighter star. So if a star is brighter than 17, its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than one with V=17.

So for a star to be detected by ESPRESSO, its V mag must be ≤17. Because "brighter than 17" would mean the magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V mag ≤16.

Wait, no. Wait the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So, brighter stars than 17 mag. So, if a star's apparent V
