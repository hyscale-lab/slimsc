Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Oh right, the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. Let me think. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So mathematically, it's n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). But wait, what if E_i is higher than E_j? Oh right, if E_i is higher, then the exponent becomes negative. So the more excited state (higher energy) has fewer particles unless the temperature is really high.

In this problem, the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me call this delta E, so delta E = 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, if I let the ratio be n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number of excited atoms in star_1 and n2 in star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me clarify. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the number of atoms in that excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations is n_i/n_j = exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). Because if E_i > E_j, then E_j - E_i is negative, so the exponent is negative, leading to a smaller n_i than n_j, which aligns with the fact that higher energy levels have fewer atoms. So, in this case, the excited state is higher in energy, so E_i is higher than E_j (the ground state, perhaps). So the ratio would be n_i/n_j = exp( - delta E / (k T) ), where delta E is positive.

Wait, but the problem says the atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So, n1 (excited in star1) is 2 * n2 (excited in star2). So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_excited)/(n_total) for each star. Or is it the ratio between the populations of the excited state and a lower state? Hmm. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in that specific excited level to the number in the ground level is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

I think I need to model this using the Boltzmann equation. So for each star, the ratio of the number in the excited state (n_i) to the number in the ground state (n_j) is given by (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ).

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n1_i / n1_j, and for star_2 as R2 = n2_i / n2_j. According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

Now, each R is given by the Boltzmann factor. So R1 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) ), and R2 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) ).

So substituting R1 = 2 R2:

exp( - delta E / (k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

Hmm, taking the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Let me do that.

ln( exp( - delta E / (k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( - delta E / (k T2) ) )

Simplify left side: ln(exp(x)) = x. So,

- delta E / (k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp( - delta E / (k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) - delta E/(k T2)

Let me rearrange terms. Bring the delta E terms to one side.

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me rearrange the equation step by step.

Starting from:

- (delta E)/(k T1) = ln(2) - (delta E)/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by (-k):

delta E / T1 = -k ln(2) + delta E / T2

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's move all delta E terms to one side.

delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor delta E/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

So,

delta E/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) )= ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

delta E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but I don't see delta E in any of the answer options, so perhaps it's a ratio that cancels out. Wait, but maybe the given delta E is a specific value, but in the equation, it's on both sides and thus cancels if we're taking a ratio.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the approach again. Maybe I should have taken the ratio of R1 over R2. Because R1 is 2 * R2, so R1 / R2 = 2.

So,

(R1)/(R2) = exp( [ -delta E/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -delta E/(k T2) ] ) )

Which is exp( [ (-delta E/(k T1)) + (delta E/(k T2) ) ] )

Which is exp( delta E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Set this equal to 2.

So, exp( (delta E / k)(1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking ln of both sides:

(delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

(delta E /k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, which one has ln(2) equal to a function of T1 and T2.

Wait, the options don't have delta E involved. So perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference (delta E) is the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron. So delta E is a constant. So in the equation,

(delta E /k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But this would mean that the equation is ln(2) equals [ (delta E /k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) )

But none of the options have delta E or k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the equation can be rearranged in terms of T1 and T2 without the delta E and k.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should express it in terms of the ratio of temperatures. Let me think: Maybe we can find a relation between T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

We have R1 = 2 R2.

Which is,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( - delta E/(k T2) ):

exp( [ - delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which is,

exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking the natural log:

delta E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, but again, I'm stuck because the options don't include delta E. So perhaps I have to make another substitution here.

Wait, what's delta E/(k)? Let me compute that. Delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So delta E/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which becomes,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / 1 K.

But wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) = (T1 T2) ln(2)

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Let me see the options.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which matches exactly what we have. Because we have (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1 âˆ’ T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but wait. Let me go back to the step where I substituted delta E/(k) as 1 K. That's correct because 1.38e-23 J divided by 1.38e-23 J/K gives 1 K. So delta E/(k) = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

(1 K) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Which, when K is canceled out:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * (1 K) )? Wait, no. Wait, 1 K multiplied by something in K^-1 (because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is (1/K) * K? Wait, T is in K, so (T1 - T2) is in K, T1 T2 is K^2, so the denominator is K^2, so the whole expression is (K)/(K^2) )= 1/K.

But when you have (1 K) multiplied by (1/K), that's dimensionless, which matches ln(2).

So yes, [ (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 ) ) equals ln(2).

So the equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the ratio of populations of particles in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Substituting the ratio into the equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this:

\[
1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
