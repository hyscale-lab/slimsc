Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanet detection. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

So, there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The astronomers are observing this star and seeing brightness variations because the spots rotate into and out of view. But this setup can look similar to an exoplanet causing the same kind of brightness dip when it transits.

The question is asking, what would be the radius of an exoplanet (Rpl) compared to the star's radius (Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, assuming there are no spots?

Wait, so without spots, a planet transiting in front would block some light. The amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. Right, because the star's flux is uniform (without spots), the dip is just the area ratio.

But wait, in the spotted case, the star's brightness isn't uniform. Half the star (hemisphere) is covered with spots, and each spot is 1000 K cooler. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots covering that hemisphere. So the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, and spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the total star's surface.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So when the star is observed, the brightness variations caused by the spots rotating into view are similar to the dip from a planet transit.

Wait, no. The spot modulation is due to rotation. As the star spins, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness change would be a periodic variation as the spots rotate. But the planet transit would cause a sharp dip when the planet moves in front.

But the problem states that the photometric time-series (brightness over time) shows periodic variations due to the spots, which can "closely resemble" the presence of an exoplanet. So when the star's brightness is changing because a spot is coming into view, it's similar to a planet blocking the star's light.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the variations caused by the spot rotation have the same amplitude as a planet's transit. So we need to compute the amplitude caused by the spots and compare it to the amplitude of a planet transit.

Wait, the question is about finding the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same amplitude as the spots. So first, I need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots as the star rotates. Then set that equal to the amplitude from a planet transit and solve for the planet's radius.

Let me think about how star spots affect the observed brightness. When a spot is facing towards us (on the star's disk), it emits less light because it's cooler. As the star rotates, the spot moves into and out of view, causing fluctuations in the observed brightness.

The key is to compute the change in flux due to the spots. Let's
