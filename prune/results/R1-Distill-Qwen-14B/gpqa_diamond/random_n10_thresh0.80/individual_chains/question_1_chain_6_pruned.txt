Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width is ΔE1, and for state 2, it's ΔE2. The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their line widths, perhaps? Because if it's just larger than either, but the other is bigger, maybe the lines could still overlap.

Wait, let me think again. The lifetime is τ, so the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So for state 1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9). State 2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). So state 1 has a larger ΔE because its lifetime is shorter.

So, the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two ΔE's, or larger than their sum? Hmm.

Wait, to resolve two lines, the separation between their centers (E2 - E1) should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, the lines might overlap. So the required ΔE (between E2 and E1) should be more than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

But wait, what's the value of ħ in eV·s units? I think ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for state 1, τ1 =1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (6.582e-16)/(2 *1e-9) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) )= about 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 → 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, τ2=1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16/(2 * 1e-8) )= 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 → 3.291e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is 3.291e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

The sum of these is 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this sum, 3.62e-7 eV, to be clearly resolved.

But looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV, much smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → that's 1e-4, which is much bigger than 3.6e-7. So that's way larger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01e-6 eV. Still way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

So the only option that's larger than the required sum is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but the sum is 3.6e-7, which is 3.6e-7. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 * larger. So C is definitely larger than the required sum.

Then, the other options are way too small. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states:

1. For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2
