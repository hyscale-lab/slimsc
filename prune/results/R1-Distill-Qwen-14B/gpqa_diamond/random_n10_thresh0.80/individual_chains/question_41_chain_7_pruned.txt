Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are given as A to D.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and in the same direction as the light beam. That's a bit confusing. Let me visualize it. Imagine the glass slab is moving to the right (same direction as the light beam, which is also moving right towards the observer). Wait, no, wait. The observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, that would mean the beam is going towards the observer, same as the glass's movement.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the beam. The observer is in the lab, so their frame is the lab frame. So how does this affect the speed of the light beam as measured in the lab?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab. So does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light inside it according to an outside observer?

From what I recall, in special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of the source's motion. But here, the medium is moving, and light is in the medium. So how does that work?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving at speed v_light relative to the glass. The question is, what is the speed of light relative to the lab?

Wait, let's think in terms of frames. In the glass frame, the speed of light is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So perhaps we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity to find the speed in the lab frame.

The velocity addition formula for parallel velocities is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/cÂ²),
