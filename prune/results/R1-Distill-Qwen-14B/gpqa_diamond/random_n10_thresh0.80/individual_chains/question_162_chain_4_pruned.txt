Okay, so I have this question about a metric in general relativity or differential geometry. The metric given is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

And the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. The options are A to D, with D being infinity.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what kind of geometry this metric represents. The form of the metric looks like a 2-dimensional metric because dx² and dy² are involved, and no dz or other coordinates. So it's a 2D space.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That makes me think of a sphere because x² + y² + z² = r², but here it's in two dimensions, so perhaps it's a circle. The denominator would be zero when x² + y² =4, so maybe the radius is 2 because 4 is 2 squared.

But wait, pseudosphere—oh, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. But sometimes in 2D, a pseudosphere might be a hyperbolic space. But this metric doesn't look like the standard hyperbolic metric.

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix) is different, but perhaps this is a 2D Lorentzian metric? Or maybe it's a Euclidean space with a conformal factor.

Wait, the given metric is written as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see
