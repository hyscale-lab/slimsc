Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that the number density is the same everywhere. So, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax change with parallax?

Wait, parallax. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means that as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes. So I think we're looking at the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, maybe? Because parallax relates to distance, and if stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "number of stars per unit range of parallax." So maybe it's the number per unit plx. But how does this relate to distance?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is plx =1/d. So the distance is d=1/plx. Now, let's think about a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. How many stars are in that shell?

If the stars are uniformly distributed, then the number of stars per unit volume is constant, say n. So the number in the shell would be n * (4πd² dr). Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πd²) times thickness dr.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, dr would be the change in distance. Let me see. If plx is p, then d = 1/p. So when plx changes by dplx, what's the change in distance, dr?

Wait, dr is the change in distance. Let's see, dr = derivative of d with respect to p times dplx. Because p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But since we're dealing with a small change, the negative just indicates direction, but for magnitude, it's d² dp. So dr
