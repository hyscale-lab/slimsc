Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance, right? So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So as plx decreases, distance increases.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. So N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the differential, like how does N change as r increases by a little bit.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number density, like the number per unit distance. Let's think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to d^5 multiplied by the volume of that shell. Wait, wait, wait. Or, perhaps I should model it as the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance, and then find how the number in a given distance interval changes.

Wait a second, the number of stars in a small volume element (a shell) would depend on both the number density and the volume. Let me think about this.

The number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's the total number of stars up to some distance? Or the number per unit volume?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify.

The relation given is N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant.

Since plx = 1/d, N = k * d^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But this is the total number of stars? Or number per
