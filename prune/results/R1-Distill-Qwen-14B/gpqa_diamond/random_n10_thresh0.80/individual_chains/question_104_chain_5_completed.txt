Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. The star moves back and forth because of the planet's gravity, so we can infer the planet's presence based on these shifts.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each planet (similar to Neptune) detected using RV. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K = (v) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2). But since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so the (M_star + M_p) simplifies to M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So K is roughly proportional to M_p / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3), but wait, I think I might be mixing up the formula.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) 

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is approximately 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is typical for RV method to detect). So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I think the more straightforward approach is to consider the Doppler shift caused by the star's velocity. The star's velocity K (semi-amplitude) is what's causing the spectral line shift. So a larger K means a larger velocity, which implies a more massive planet or shorter orbital period, depending on the other parameters.

Wait, the period P of the planet is related to the star's velocity and the mass. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5))) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The RV method detects the star's velocity which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula I think is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P )/(2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, perhaps there's a better way. Another approach is to compare the two stars and planets.

Both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the ratio of their velocities (semi-amplitude) K1 and K2 is determined by their periods.

Wait, because K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), assuming everything else is the same. Wait, let me get this right.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P) ) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to recall the formula from the radial velocity method. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Since both planets have similar masses and the stars have the same mass, and assuming sin i is similar (e.g., i=90 degrees for both), then:

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 sin i1) / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( (2π G)/(c P1) )^(1/3) ) ] / [ same for P2 ]

But M_p1 = M_p2 (given they are similar to Neptune), and M_star is same, so:

K1/K2 = ( (2π G)/(c) )^(1/3) * [ (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) ) ] ) 
= (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let's think again. Let me write this correctly.

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both, K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me see: K1 = (constant) * (1/P1^(1/3) ), K2 = same constant * (1/P2^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the formula, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So 1.4 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

To find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (1.4)^3 = P2/P1.

1.4 cubed is 1.4 *1.4=1.96, 1.96 *1.4= around 2.744.

Wait, wait, wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K implies shorter period. Because if the star is moving faster (higher K), that's because the planet is orbiting more quickly, i.e., shorter orbital period.

So in the problem, K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), so P2 must be shorter than P1. Therefore, P2/P1 would be less than 1.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation:

K2/K1 = [ (P2/P1) ]^(1/3 )

So K2 = 7, K1=5 --> K2/K1=7/5 =1.4.

So 1.4 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: 1.4^3 = P2/P1 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

Wait that would mean P2 is longer than P1. But earlier reasoning said higher K implies shorter period, so this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me correct.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) )

So K is proportional to [1/P^(1/3)] * [M_p / M_star^(2/3) ]

Given that M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, the ratio K1/K2 is [ (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) ] = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Given K1 is 5, K2 is7, so K2/K1 =7/5=1.4. So 1.4 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

To find P2/P1: cube both sides: (1.4)^3= P2/P1.

Wait, 1.4^3 is 1.4*1.4=1.96, 1.96*1.4=2.744.

So P2/P1=2.744. So P2 is approximately 2.744 times longer than P1.

Wait, but wait. If K is higher, that would mean the star is moving faster. A higher velocity could imply a shorter period because the star has to complete an orbit more quickly. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 should be smaller than P1. But according to the formula, P2 is larger. That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The formula is K proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)).

So K = (constant) * (1/P^(1/3)).

So for a larger K, 1/P^(1/3) is larger. So P^(1/3) is smaller, meaning P is smaller. So when K is larger, P is smaller. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is smaller than P1.

So in the problem, K2 is larger, so P2 is shorter. But according to the ratio we just calculated, P2 is longer. Hmm, this is a conflict.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula inversion.

Let me re-derive the formula.

The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π c ) / ( P ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, maybe I should think in terms of proportionality.

The key point is, for the same star mass and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P.

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So higher K implies shorter P.

So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), then P2 is shorter than P1.

But according to our earlier calculation, when K2/K1 = 7/5=1.4, which equals (P2/P1)^(1/3 ), so P2/P1= (1.4)^3=2.744. That would mean P2 is longer than P1, which contradicts.

This suggests that I must have made a mistake in the proportionality.

Wait, perhaps the correct relationship is that K is proportional to (P)^(−1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So if K1=5, K2=7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 is roughly (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36 times.

That would mean P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet #2 is shorter.

Which aligns with the expectation that higher K (7) implies shorter period.

So the question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1.

Wait, wait. The question asks: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 = 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1? No, wait, that's not right.

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of P2 is shorter.

But the question is asking for how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the ratio is the inverse.

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is 0.36, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 0.36 times longer.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~ 1.40

C) ~ 1.96

D) ~ 0.85

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the correct answer is option A, approximately 0.36 times longer.

So the answer would be A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). For two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
0.714 = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

This means that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the ratio is approximately \( 0.36 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
