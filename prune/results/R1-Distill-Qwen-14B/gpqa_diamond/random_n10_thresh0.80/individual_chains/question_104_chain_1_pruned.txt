Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with Neptune-like masses. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet by measuring the periodic shift in their spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So I'm looking for the ratio of P2/P1.

I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass and orbital period of the planet. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_star + M_p) ) * ( (1 AU)^3 / (P year) ) )^(1/3) or wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3))

But since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p is much less than M_star, so the denominator M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular, so that term is 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. K is inversely proportional to the orbital period's cube root, because the other terms are related to mass and other factors.

Wait, let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (V) = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so that term is approximately 1. So K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3))

Wait, but maybe a more straightforward approach would be to consider that for a given mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because from Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³/(M_star), so a ∝ (P² M_star)^(1/3).

But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by another formula. Let me recall: K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star
