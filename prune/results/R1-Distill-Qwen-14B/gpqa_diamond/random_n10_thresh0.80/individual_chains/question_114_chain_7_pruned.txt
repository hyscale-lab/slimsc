Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Reacting ketones with cyanide usually leads to some kind of nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

But wait, what happens when a ketone reacts with HCN? I remember that ketones can undergo addition with HCN to form cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the hydroxyl and nitrile groups are both added to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon.

So the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin. But here, the reagent is NaCN and reagent A. Hmm, so NaCN provides the CN- ion. But for the addition to happen, we need an acid catalyst maybe?

Wait, because HCN is a weak acid, but in this case, we're using NaCN and another reagent. Oh, right! So perhaps reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is H
