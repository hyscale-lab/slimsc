Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question has two parts with two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different choices for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that butan-2-one is a ketone, and when it reacts with NaCN, it's probably a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, no, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition. Oh right, in the presence of a base, a ketone can react with a nucleophile. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps under certain conditions, it adds the CN- to the carbonyl. But wait, that would form a cyanohydrin. Because when a ketone reacts with CN-, it's a nucleophilic addition, leading to a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Wait, the
