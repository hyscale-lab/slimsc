Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300. But alcohol O-H is also in that range. Hmm. Then there's a peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated ketone or maybe an amide. But wait, there's no mention of amines in the NMR, so maybe not an amide.

Looking at the NMR data, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, the presence of vinyl Hs suggests maybe a conjugated system, which could explain the IR peaks around 1700 and 1650. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So like a ketone with a double bond next to it.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think about what fragments could give that. 45 is a common mass. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91, so that's not it. Maybe a smaller fragment. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion) which is 58, no. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's calculate:

Option A: C6H12O2. The formula is C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. Mw is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion (M+) would be at 116, 98, 114, or 100. The fragment at 45 is lower.
