Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question says that the number of stars in a specific region varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance, r. The options are various functions of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. Oh wait, but wait—does that matter here? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me think about what that implies. If N (number of stars) is proportional to 1/plx^5, then N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to relate this to distance, not parallax.

Since d = 1/plx, maybe I can express plx in terms of d. Let's see, plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation for N, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(that) would be d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density or something. Or perhaps the rate of change of the number with distance.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given, but we need the number as a function of distance. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then N = k*(d)^5, where k is a constant.

So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Wait, no
