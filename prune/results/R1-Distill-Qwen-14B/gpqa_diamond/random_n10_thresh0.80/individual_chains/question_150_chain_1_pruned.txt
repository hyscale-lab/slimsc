Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of what functional groups we're dealing with. The formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a couple rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, could it be something else? Maybe an acidic proton like an aromatic -OH? But that's usually broad or around 5 ppm. So probably an aldehyde here.
- 6.98 (d, 2H): Downfield doublet. Could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted.
- 6.51 (d, 2H): Also aromatic, perhaps adjacent to the substituent or another position.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe an enol proton or something like that. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton that's coupled in a certain way. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with some substituent causing the protons to be deshielded?
- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet, probably some CH2 group next to an electron-withdrawing group. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring connected to another group. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: benzene rings are C6H5, so if there are two benzene rings, that would be C12H10, which is way more than C8. So that can't be. So maybe one benzene ring and another group.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is probably the aldehyde proton. So the compound has an aldehyde group. So the structure probably has a benzene ring connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde.

So maybe something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think about the substituents.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests two sets of two equivalent protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, like another group attached, leading to two doublets for the two sets of equivalent protons.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. That's a bit tricky. It could be an enol proton, like in a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group, as in an alpha, beta-unsaturated system.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's part of an ether or next to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2-O-something.

Wait, putting it all together, perhaps the molecule is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Let's think of a possible structure. Let me imagine the molecule.

Suppose the benzene ring is connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde. Let's say the chain is something like CH2-CH2-CHO. But that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound has a benzyl group attached to a larger structure that includes
