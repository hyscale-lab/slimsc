Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values multiplied by powers of ten to the minus some exponent meters.

Hmm, I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, right, the mean decay distance (often called the decay length) is the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So, L = v * τ. But how do I find τ from the given data?

I recall that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the inverse of Γ multiplied by some constants. Oh right, the relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because Γ is given in MeV, I'll have to convert that to GeV, I think.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. So 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32
