Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. The problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's probably about their peak emission wavelengths, right? Oh yeah, that's the black body radiation part. And then the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.

They're asking about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. So, I think I'll need to calculate the luminosities using the black body formula.

Wait, but let's think about what affects the luminosity. Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, because L is the power emitted, and R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the problem states that the stars are black bodies. So we can model them that way. Now, the peak wavelength where they emit most strongly is the same. That's from Wien's law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. Hmm, that's an important point. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait: the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, right, that's probably their Doppler shifts because of their motion. So that could affect the observed wavelengths. But the question is about the stars' actual emission, not what's observed. Or does it? Because the way the question is phrased, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So if the stars are moving, their emitted peak wavelength would be Doppler shifted.

Wait, but if the observed peak wavelengths are the same, that would imply that their actual (rest frame) temperatures might not be the same. Because
