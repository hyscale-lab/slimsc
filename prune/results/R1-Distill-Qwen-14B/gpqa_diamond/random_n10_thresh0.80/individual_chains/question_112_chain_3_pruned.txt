Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because right now it's just proportional, not a unit vector. Wait, but maybe the probabilities don't require it since it's proportional. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'll proceed.

Then, there's an operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so this operator is a 2x2 matrix because there are two basis states, |up> and |down>. Let me think about the matrix form. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like this:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, that makes sense. So this is a spin operator, maybe in the x or y direction? Wait, the Pauli matrices for σx and σy have similar structures but with different signs and some real/imaginary parts. Oh, but this A matrix is diagonal zero with off-diagonal elements as hbar/2. Hmm, perhaps it's proportional to σx or σy. But maybe that's not important right now.

The problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator, and the average value of the operator.

Wait, but first, the probabilities. The operator's eigenstates are the eigenstates for which we can make measurements. So to find the probabilities, I should express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps I can diagonalize it and find its eigenstates, then project |alpha> onto those.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value directly using matrix elements, but I'm not sure. Let me plan the steps.

First, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the operator is 2x2, and the matrix is:

A = [ 0     (hbar/2) ]
      (hbar/2) 0    ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix?

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0. So let's compute that:

| (-λ)      (hbar/2) |
| (hbar/2)  (-λ)     | = 0

So the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = hbar/2.

We solve (A - (hbar
