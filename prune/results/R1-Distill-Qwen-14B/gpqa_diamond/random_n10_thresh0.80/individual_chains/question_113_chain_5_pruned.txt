Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data with the correct formula.

Alright, the FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups. Like, in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an aromatic ring with hydrogen bonding, like in phenols. Hmm.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But 1650 is a bit lower than the usual 1700. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe an amide? But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any with N, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group. Like an ester or a ketone with conjugation?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to something? Wait, 45 is also the mass of (CH3)O⁻, the methoxide ion. Or maybe it's from a ketone group, like if the molecule loses a larger fragment and leaves a smaller one. Alternatively, the fragment could come from something like (CH₂)₂O, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the options.

Options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, all are six carbons, varying in H and O counts.

Let me think about the possible structures for each. Let's see
