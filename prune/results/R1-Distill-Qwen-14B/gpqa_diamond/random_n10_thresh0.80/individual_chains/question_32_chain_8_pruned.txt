Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light (c). The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, I think. And if it has 3 neutrons, then its isotope must be... let me calculate the mass number. The mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So 3 protons (since it's Li) plus 3 neutrons gives A=6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the question is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we'll definitely need to use relativistic equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, the energy referred to is the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. The question says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Or does it refer to the total energy? Hmm. I'll have to be careful about that.

The formula for total energy (E) is γ times the rest mass energy (m0c²). And the kinetic energy (K) is E - m0c² = (γ - 1)m0c². So I need to figure out which one the question is asking for. The question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c". RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which I think is their kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes colliders specify their energy as the total energy per beam. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. In particle physics, when they say the collider operates at a certain energy, that's usually the center-of-mass energy, but in this case, the question is about the energy (presumably kinetic) imparted to each nucleus. So perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy. Let me clarify. The problem statement says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, the energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy provided to the nucleus. Or wait, maybe it's the total energy. Hmm. Let's proceed and see.

First, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but considering binding energy. However, for precision, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can approximate it using the average mass of a nucleon. Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So, for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the rest mass m0 would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV/c² = 5.6
