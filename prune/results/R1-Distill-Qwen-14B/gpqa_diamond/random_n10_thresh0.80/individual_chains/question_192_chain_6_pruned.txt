Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding might come into play. But wait, I think that's when the conductor is charged. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor here is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. 

So, in the case of a conducting shell with a charge inside the cavity, if the shell is uncharged, the charge inside induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the shell is a conductor, so the charges would redistribute. For an uncharged conductor, I think that the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q if the shell is neutral overall. Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is initially uncharged, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity... So the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance it, making the total charge of the conductor zero. Wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged, but we added +q inside. So the conductor's net charge is +q? Or is it that the conductor's net charge is zero, and the inner surface has -q, outer +q? Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think. The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge +q inside the cavity would cause the electrons in the conductor to be attracted
