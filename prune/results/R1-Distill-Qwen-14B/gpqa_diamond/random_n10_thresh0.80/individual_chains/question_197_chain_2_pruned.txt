Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through carefully. Let's read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the IR and NMR data provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Then, I'll think about what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or maybe an N-H stretch, but since the other options don't have amines, probably O-H. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broader and around 2500-3300. The 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad range, which might include an O-H stretch.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet, that's probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols typically have O-H around 1-5 ppm, but a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually broader and up around 10 ppm.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps two aromatic protons next to each other.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, also aromatic. Maybe the other two protons on the ring, so perhaps para-substituted with another group.
Wait, 8.0 ppm downfield suggests maybe electron-withdrawing groups. If it's a benzoic acid, the ring protons would be more deshielded, but benzoic acid's COOH is usually at around 12 ppm or so. Hmm, the 10.5 is a bit lower than that, but maybe it's still a carboxylic acid.

The other NMR signals:
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH near an electronegative group, like adjacent to a carbonyl. Or maybe a CH in a chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Possibly CH2 groups, maybe in a chain or part of a larger substituent.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet, so maybe a CH(CH3) group, like an isopropyl or maybe a butyl group where the CH is split into a doublet.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3 group, so maybe like a ethyl chain or something similar.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent. The aromatic signals at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets suggest that the substituent is para, so the ring might have two substituents in para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that's causing the splitting.

Wait, the aromatic region has two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the ring has two substituents in para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. Wait, no, actually, for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would have its own effect. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent with two substituents in the ring, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring
