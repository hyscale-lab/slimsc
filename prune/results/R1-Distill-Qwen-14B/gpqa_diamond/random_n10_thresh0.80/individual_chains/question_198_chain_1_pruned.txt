Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of coordination chemistry and stability constants. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants β1 to β4 as 9, 40, 63, and 16, respectively.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about what each β represents. Stability constants, right. I remember that the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for a complex like [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+), βn would be the formation constant for that complex.

So, Co(II) can form complexes with SCN-: the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^(+), second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, third is [Co(SCN)_3]^(–), and fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2–, I think. Each β represents the step-wise formation constant for adding another SCN- ion. Or wait, no, wait. Or maybe βn is the overall constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure but I think for such problems, each βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So, β1 would be for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^–, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2–. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex.

But wait, when calculating the fraction of each species, I need to consider all possible complexes and the free metal ion. The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue, but I think in the case of Co(II) thiocyanato complexes, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one, and it's the dithiocyanato, so n=2. So we're looking for the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Okay, so the first step is to figure out the fraction of each species present in solution. To do this, I think I need to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants. Since the stability constants vary, the distribution of the complexes depends on their β values and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex using the given β values and the concentrations. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the formula involving the β values and concentrations.

The formula for the fraction of a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(something) is (β1β2β3...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / (denominator), where the denominator includes terms
