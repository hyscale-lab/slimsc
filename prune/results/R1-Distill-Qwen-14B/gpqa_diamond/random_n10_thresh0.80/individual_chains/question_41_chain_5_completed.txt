Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by the refractive index, right? So in this case, the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but wait, c is given as 1 here. So normally, the speed would be 1/n, but since the glass is moving, does that affect it?

Wait, but hold on. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. I think this is a case where we need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, but wait, maybe not. Because the speeds involved are probably non-relativistic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Wait. The speed of light in the medium is always c (or 1 here). So regardless of the motion of the medium, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame should still be c. Wait, but that's only in a vacuum, right? Because when a medium is moving, how does that affect the light's speed in that medium?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When a medium is moving, does it carry the light with it? Like, if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through it, would the observer see the light moving at (c/n) + v, or is that incorrect?

Wait, but I think in reality, the speed of light in a medium is independent of the motion of the medium. Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So no matter how fast the glass is moving, the light inside it should still move at c (or 1 here) relative to the observer. But wait, wait, isn't the speed of light in a medium dependent on the medium's velocity?

Wait, that's only for the velocity of the medium relative to the observer. Oh, no, wait. I think for non-relativistic speeds, we can use Galilean addition, but when speeds are significant compared to c, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so maybe we have to consider both approaches.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, but the speed of light within a medium is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. So if the medium is moving, then in the lab frame, the speed would be c/n plus the velocity of the medium? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the rest frame of the glass. In that frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n (since c=1). Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we have to apply a Lorentz transformation if the velocities are relativistic. But since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, perhaps we have to consider relativistic addition.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab, the glass is moving, and the light is inside it.

In the glass's frame, the light propagates at speed u' = 1/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). But wait, since c=1, this becomes u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v).

So u' is 1/n, so substituting, we have u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ) ).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n + v) )

Wait, but that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1+n v)/(n -v )

D) (1-n v)/(n +v )

So the calculation gives (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. Hmm, but the light beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in that same direction, then the light's velocity in the lab would be higher than the glass's velocity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me think about it again. Let me define the direction: let me say the positive direction is towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the positive direction (toward observer) at speed v. The light is also moving in the positive direction in the glass's frame, at speed u' = 1/n.

Wait, but when you're in the glass frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So to the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass (but wait, no, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab sees the glass moving at v. So when you transform from the glass (S') to the lab (S), the velocity u in S is given by (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) ).

Wait, but in this case, the light's velocity in S' is 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So u' is positive, v is positive. So applying the formula:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

Substituting u' = 1/n, v = v.

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v)(1/n) )

Which is same as (1 + n v)/n divided by (n + v)/n.

The n's cancel, so u = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe the answer is 1, but that's only when considering that the speed of light is always c. But wait, no. Because the speed of light in the medium depends on the medium's frame, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed in the lab would change according to the velocity addition formula.

But wait, wait, wait. The speed of light in a medium when the medium is moving: I was taught that the speed of light in a medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But that's only in the rest frame of the medium. So in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, perhaps the speed isn't c/n but something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it from another angle. If the glass is stationary, the light's speed is 1/n. If the glass is moving at velocity v, in the same direction as the light, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than 1/n, because the medium is moving in the same direction. So according to the earlier calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which for small v would be approximately (1 +n v)/(n) ), which is 1/n + v/(n) * (1/n ). Wait, maybe that's not the right way to approximate.

Alternatively, when v is much smaller than 1, the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v ) can be approximated by (1 +n v ) /n * (1 -v/n ) ) approximately (1/n ) (1 + n v - v/n ... ), but perhaps that's more complicated.

But according to the calculation using velocity addition, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. But I'm a bit uncertain because I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c, but that's only when measured in a vacuum. Wait no, in a medium, the speed is c/n, but that's in the medium's frame. When the medium is moving, the lab frame would measure a different speed.

Wait, but another way to think about it: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light's speed in the glass is 1/n, so in the lab frame, the speed would be v + (1/n) divided by (1 + (v)(1/n)). Because when you add velocities, you have to account for the relativistic addition.

Wait, that's the same as before. So according to that, u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n) ) = (n v +1)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, another perspective: the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties and the observer's frame. But Einstein's postulate says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, but in a medium, it's different. So when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light in the medium would change.

Wait, but I think in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame. So using the velocity addition formula is the correct approach here, which leads to option A.

Wait, but what if the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light in it? That would be if the speed is always c, but that's only in a vacuum. In a medium, it's c/n. So when the medium is moving, perhaps the observed speed is (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n)*v /c² ), which simplifies to ( (c + n v )/(n (1 + v/(n c)) )) )

Wait, but since c is 1, this becomes (1 +n v)/(n (1 + v/(n) )) ) = (1 +n v)/(n + v ), which is the same as before. So yes, option A. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought: what if the light is moving inside the glass, which is itself moving. So from the lab's frame, the speed of the light would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light within the glass relative to the glass, divided by the appropriate relativistic factor. So yes, that's exactly what we did.

So the answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Medium**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

2. **Relative Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**: Simplify the numerator and denominator:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression.
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because the speed of light in the glass depends on the refractive index \( n \) and the relative motion of the glass.
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it aligns with the relativistic velocity addition formula and the given conditions.

Answer: A
