Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at two different points during a titration. Let's see, the setup is that we're diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralization reactions, and pH changes based on the equivalence point and how much titrant has been added.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, the initial solution: we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half of the initial concentration, because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant. Oh, wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Diluting to 0.04 L (40 cm³), so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. What's the volume needed at equivalence? The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles (from before). Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), moles of NaOH needed are same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let me make sure: 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So, for the two parts:

1. pH at 25% titration.
2. pH at equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part separately.

Starting with the 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. So the solution is a buffer solution. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. But first, I need to find the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion.

Wait, more accurately, the moles of acetic acid and acetate after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let's calculate that.

First, initial moles in the diluted solution (after mixing): 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

When we add 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH to produce CH3COO^- (acetate), the moles of
