Okay, so I have this question about planets and transits. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period usually means a closer orbit, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, the orbital period is related to the distance squared and the mass of the star.

Oh wait, the host stars: the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So same size, but different masses. That probably affects the probability of transit.

I think the probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance. The formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / R_star)^2)). But wait, since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar. So R_planet is roughly the same for both.

Wait, no, the planets are Earth-like in mass, but the question doesn't specify their radii. Hmm, but if they're Earth-like, their radii would be similar. So maybe it's safe to assume R_planet is the same for both. So the R_star divided by a (semi-major axis) would be the main factor here.

Wait, a is the semi-major axis. But since the planets have different orbital periods, their a would be different. Let's think about Kepler's third law: (P^2)/(a^3) = (4π²)/(G(M_star + M_planet)), but M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so we can approximate M as just the star's mass.

So for each planet, P is known. Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1.

But wait, no. The question says Planet_1 has a shorter period: three times shorter. So Planet_1's period is P, Planet_2's is 3P.

Wait, I'll correct that. So Planet_1: period P, Planet_2: period 3P.

We can use Kepler's third law to find the ratio of a1 to a2. Since a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star. Wait, the exact formula is (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star) / (4π²). So a is proportional to P^(2/3) * (M_star)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 ∝ (P)^(2/3) * (2M)^(1/3) because its host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host (M2 = M).

For Planet_2: a2 ∝ (3P)^(2/3) * (M)^(1/3).

Let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (P^(2/3) ) * (2M)^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( (3P)^(2/3) ) * (M)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ P^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) M^(1/3) ] / [ (3^(2/3) P^(2/3)) * M^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm, M^(1/3) cancels out. P^(2/3) cancels. So:

= 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ?

Wait no, 3^(2/3) is cube root of 9. 2^(1/3) is cube root of 2. So the ratio is cube root (2/9) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact ratio. Let me see:

a1/a2 = ( (P/(3P))^(2/3) ) * ( (2M)/M )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

a1 = k * P^(2/3) * (2M)^(1/3)
a2 = k * (3P)^(2/3) * M^(1/3)
So a1/a2 = [ P^(2/3) * (2M)^(1/3) ] / [ (3P)^(2/3) * M^(1/3) ]
= [ (P/(3P))^(2/3) ) ] * [ (2M/M)^(1/3) ) ]
= (1/3)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3)

Which is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3). Let me compute that:

(2/3^2 )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.608.

So a1 is about 0.608 * a2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find a1 in terms of a2. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because the planet with the shorter period (Planet_1) is closer to its star (higher mass as well, but the period is shorter—so maybe the effect of mass is more significant? Or is the period more so? Let me think: for a higher mass star, if a planet has the same period, it's further out. But if the period is shorter, the distance would be even smaller. So in this case, Planet_1's a is smaller than Planet_2's a.

Now, the probability of transit depends on (R_star / a), assuming the star is much larger than the planet and that the orbit is edge-on. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * f, where f is a function involving the inclination, but since we're comparing probabilities, perhaps it's just proportional to R/a.

Wait, more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) )? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star (π R_star²) to the area of the planet's orbit (π a²), but that's not exactly right. Because the planet's path is a circle, the area in which it can cross our line of sight is a circle of diameter 2R_star. So the probability is (R_star / a) * (something), but the exact formula is (R_star / a) / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) ) ? Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle, but perhaps the approximation is that the probability is (R_star / a)².

Wait, perhaps the exact formula for the probability of transit is (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) ) / (some factor). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) / something. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_star / a)². Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, but only if the planet's orbit is randomly oriented. So the probability P is approximately ( (R_star) / a )².

Wait, no. Let me think again: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is given by the ratio of the area of the disk of the star to the area of the orbit. But wait, the orbit is a circle of radius a, and the planet's path across the sky is a line. Wait no, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ) / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I've heard it's (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) / something. Alternatively, perhaps P ~ (R_star / a)², but I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately (R_star / a)^2.

So, if that's the case, then for each planet, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2.

So, in this case, since both stars have the same radius (R_star is the same for both), the probability depends inversely on a squared. So P ∝ 1/a².

Wait, but wait, no. Because higher a makes (R/a) smaller, so the probability is lower. So a planet with a larger a has a lower probability to transit.

Wait, but the transit probability also depends on whether the orbital inclination allows the transit. So for a given planet, the probability is (R_star / a) * (some function considering the geometry), but I think the exact formula for the probability is:

P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) )

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2. Let's proceed with that assumption for now.

So, given that, P ∝ (R_star / a)^2.

But R_star is the same for both planets, because the host stars have the same radii. Therefore, P is inversely proportional to a².

So, P1/P2 = (a2² / a1² )

Wait, because P is inversely proportional to a², so higher a would lead to lower P.

We calculated earlier that a1 = ~0.608 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.608 ≈ 1.643 a1.

So a2 = approximately 1.643 * a1.

So let's compute a1² and a2².

a1² = (0.608 a2 )² = (0.608)^2 a2² = 0.369 a2².

a2² is a2².

So P1 = (R / a1 )² = (R / a1 )².

P2 = (R / a2 )².

So P1/P2 = (R/(a1))² / (R/(a2))² ) = (a2²)/(a1²) ) = ( (a2/a1) )².

Since a2 is 1.643 a1, a2/a1 ≈ 1.643.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.643)^2 ≈ 2.70.

So P1/P2 ≈ 2.70. Which means P1 is about 2.7 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait: P is (R/a)^2. So if a is larger, (R/a) is smaller, so P is smaller. So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so (R/a) is larger, leading to a higher P.

So according to this, Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit than Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes the probability also depends on the star's mass and planet's mass, but in this case, we're told both planets have the same mass. So the RV method gives same mass, but in reality, RV gives a minimum mass, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a1/a2 ratio. Let me recompute that more accurately.

We have M1 = 2 M, M2 = M.

Planet_1: period P, host star mass M1 = 2M.

Planet_2: period 3P, host star mass M2 = M.

Using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_star P² ) / (4 π² )

So a1^3 = (G * 2M * P² ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G * M * (3P)^2 ) / (4 π² ) = (G * M * 9 P² ) / (4 π² )

So a1³ = (2 M P² G ) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (9 M P² G ) / (4 π² )

Taking the ratio a1³/a2³ = (2 M P² G ) / (9 M P² G ) ) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Therefore, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So when calculating the probabilities:

P1 = (R/a1 )².

P2 = (R/a2 )².

Thus, P1/P2 = ( (R/a1 )² ) / ( (R/a2 )² ) ) = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a2/a1 ≈ 1.648, then (1.648)^2 ≈ 2.716.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

Which would mean that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C says ~1.65 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transit probability formula.

Wait, another way to think: the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But if R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

But then the probability is proportional to R_star / a. So higher a means lower probability.

So the probability would then be P = R_star / a. So in that case, the ratio would be (a2 / a1), since P1 = R/a1, P2=R/a2. So P1/P2 = (a2 / a1) = 1.648. So that's about a 1.65 times higher probability for Planet_1.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the formula for transit probability depends on the 'geometric probability,' which is (R_star / a). So the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of time the planet is in the right part of the orbit, but maybe that's not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is given by the formula P = (R_star / (a * sqrt(1 - e^2))) ), but since both are circular, e=0, so P = R_star/(a). 

Wait, I should double-check the transit probability formula. 

The standard geometric transit probability for a circular orbit is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a.

Assuming R_planet << R_star, this simplifies to R_star/a.

So the probability is proportional to R_star/a.

In this case, since R_star is the same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2).

We found a1 = 0.606 a2.

So P1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R/a2) = 1.648 P2.

So Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.

Wait, that's a different conclusion than before. So which is correct?

This is a confusion point. I think I might have mixed up two different formulas.

The correct geometric transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a.

But if R_planet << R_star, then P ≈ R_star / a.

So in this case, P is proportional to 1/a.

So, if a1 is 0.606 a2, then:

P1 = R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.648 * P2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but earlier when I thought P was proportional to (R/a)^2, I thought P1/P2 was about 2.7, but with this correction, it's 1.65.

So which is correct? I think the correct approach is the geometric probability.

Wait, I found a source that says the transit probability is approximated as (R_star/(a)) * (sqrt(1 - (R_star/(a + R_star))^2 )) ) but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, another source says the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But in any case, if R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's R_star / a.

So the probability is proportional to 1/a.

So, in this case, since a1 is 0.606 a2, P1 is (1/0.606) times P2, which is about 1.648.

So approximately 1.65 times higher. So the correct option would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought P was proportional to (R/a)^2, which would give a much higher ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more precise formula.

Wait, upon checking, the correct formula for the geometric transit probability (assuming a randomly oriented orbit) is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1/(1 - e²))^{1/2}.

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), this simplifies to (R_star + R_planet)/a.

Assuming R_planet << R_star, P ≈ R_star / a.

So P is proportional to 1/a. 

So in our case, a1 is 0.606 a2, so P1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R/a2) = 1.648 * P2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So according to this, option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was option D when I assumed P was proportional to (R/a)^2. So I must have confused the formula.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information and use the transit probability formula. The transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}
\]

where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \).

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axis ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto P^2 M_{\text{star}}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1: \( P_1 \), \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2M \)
- Planet_2: \( P_2 = 3P_1 \), \( M_{\text{star,2}} = M \)

Taking the ratio of \( a_1^3 \) to \( a_2^3 \):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{P_1^2 M_{\text{star,1}}}{P_2^2 M_{\text{star,2}}} = \frac{P_1^2 (2M)}{(3P_1)^2 M} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

So, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.648
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While Planet_1 is preferred, the probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer:
The researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability.

Answer: C
