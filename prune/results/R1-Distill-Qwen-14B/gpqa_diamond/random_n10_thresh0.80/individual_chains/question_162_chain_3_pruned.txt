Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's in terms of x and y coordinates? I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably a two-dimensional surface since it's in terms of dx and dy squared terms.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given must correspond to such a surface. The area of a pseudosphere... I think the standard pseudosphere has an infinite area, but wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the metric given here is in 2D, since it's only involving dx and dy. So perhaps the metric is for a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. But regardless, I need to find out the area.

I remember that the area in a metric can be found by calculating the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric in this case is written in a diagonal form, so the determinant is just the product of the terms for dx² and dy². Wait, the given metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0 because there's no cross term
