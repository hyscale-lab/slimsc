Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the topic.

The question says a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, right, when light moves through a medium, its speed isn't c in vacuum, it's c/n. So normally, the speed is v_light = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so how does that affect things?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties. But when the medium itself is moving relative to the observer, does that change the speed as measured? Or is it more about how the light's direction and frequency change, like in the Doppler effect?

Wait, no. The speed of light in the medium is still c/n regardless of the medium's motion, right? Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the mediumâ€™s properties, not the observer's frame. So if the glass is moving, but the light is within the glass, the speed of the light within the glass is still c/n.

But wait, am I mixing up the frames here? Because the glass is moving, maybe I should consider how the light's velocity transforms when the medium is moving.

Oh, right, this might involve the addition of velocities in special relativity, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the speed of
