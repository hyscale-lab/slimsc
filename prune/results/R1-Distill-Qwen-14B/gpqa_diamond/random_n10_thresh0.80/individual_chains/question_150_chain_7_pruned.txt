Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product from the options A to D.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of protons, and the splitting tells about neighboring protons. Let's interpret these peaks.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it could be an acidic proton like an alcohol or something else, but aldehyde is more likely here.

The next peak is at 6.98 (d, 2H). A doublet with 2H suggests two equivalent protons next to each other. The downfield shift (around 7 ppm) could be from aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. Maybe two aromatic rings with substituents?

Then, 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet, also 2H. This is a bit upfield for aromatic protons, so maybe some substitution or electron-donating groups are present. Or perhaps these are allylic protons if they're near a double bond. Hmm.

The peak at 6.27 is broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like NH protons in amines or perhaps some acidic protons, but wait, the compound has a NO in the formulaâ€”maybe a nitro group? But that typically doesn't have protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group, but why a singlet and broad? Or perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative group, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, but if it's a singlet, that means no neighboring protons. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a diene or something else.

The last peak is 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet with 2H suggests two equivalent protons adjacent to another set of protons. The chemical shift around 3.6 ppm is typical for CH2 groups next to an oxygen, like in ethers or amides. Or maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something similar.

Now, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, N is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and four double bonds, but more likely, probably some combination like rings and double bonds. For example, two benzene rings would account for 4 degrees (each benzene has 3), so wait, two benzene rings would have 6 degrees (each is 4, but I might be miscalculating). Wait, let me think again. Degree of unsaturation is each ring or double bond counting as 1. Benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. So two benzene rings would be 6 degrees. But the total here is 5, so perhaps one benzene ring and another double bond or ring. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a double bond. Or a benzene ring and a ring plus another double bond. Let me think again. The molecular formula, C8H9NO, so maybe a benzene ring (C6H5) plus something else. If it's a benzene ring, that's 6 carbons, leaving 2 more. But the formula is C8, so maybe two more carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a structure like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think about the NMR. The aldehyde proton is at 9.72. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of a benzene ring. Let's think about a para-substituted benzene. The 6.98 ppm could be two H in a para position, perhaps para to something electron-withdrawing. Then the 6.51 could be adjacent, like an ortho position. Wait, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, another approach: the integration adds up to 1+2+2+2+2=9 H. The molecular formula is C8H9NO, so 9 H. So that adds up correctly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would be a but-3-enal with two phenyl groups at 2 and 4 positions.

Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO ?

Wait no, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So with substituents at 2 and 4? Hmm, maybe the structure is more like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond at position 3. Wait, but butenals are but-1-enal, but-2-enal, etc. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond somewhere. Or perhaps a conjugated system.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So that's a but-2-enal with substituents at 2 and 4 positions, both being 4-hydroxyphenyl groups.

But the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72, which would be the aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 could
