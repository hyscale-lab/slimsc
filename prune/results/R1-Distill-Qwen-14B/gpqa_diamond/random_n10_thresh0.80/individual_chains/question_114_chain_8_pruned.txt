Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents A and B from the options given. 

First reaction: Butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think, because it's (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, let me write down the structures to get a clearer picture.

Butan-2-one structure: (CH3)2CO. So it's a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The formula would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, is it (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Let me think. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl... so the structure is probably (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, butanenitrile would be CH3CH2CH2CN, right? So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the hydroxy and methyl groups on the second carbon, which is also attached to the nitrile group. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe (CH(CH2CN)(OH)CH3) but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, but that would make it longer than four carbons. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So for butanenitrile, it's CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? That can't be right because that would
