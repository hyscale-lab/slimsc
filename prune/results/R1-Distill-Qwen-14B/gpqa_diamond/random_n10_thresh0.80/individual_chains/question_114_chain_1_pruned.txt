Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B. I need to figure out which pair works for both reactions.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. The reaction is with NaCN. Wait, I remember that the nucleophilic addition to ketones usually involves something like the formation of a cyanohydrin when a nitrile is used. So NaCN would provide the CN- nucleophile.

But wait, what's the role of reagent A here? Oh, right, in the formation of a cyanohydrin, the mechanism involves the ketone attacking the nitrile. But wait, does this happen under basic or acidic conditions? I think for cyanohydrin formation, you typically use an acid catalyst. Like, adding some H+ would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. Hmm, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+, but maybe it's used in some other contexts.

Wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, is there another possibility? Like, maybe the reaction doesn't need an acid catalyst if the nitrile is a strong enough nucleophile. But I think typically, an acid is used to protonate the carbonyl. So A is H3O+. So that narrows it down to options A and B.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the same but with the nitrile group (-CN) converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. One common way is to treat them with strong acid, like HCl, followed by H2O. Or sometimes, using H2SO4 and H2O with heating. Alternatively, under basic conditions like aqueous NaOH, but that might give a different product.

Wait, but the reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So the reaction is B plus H2O. Let me think. So for nitrile to carboxylic acid, the usual steps are:
