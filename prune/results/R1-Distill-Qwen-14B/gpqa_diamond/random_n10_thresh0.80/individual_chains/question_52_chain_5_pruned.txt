Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see. The question is about stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have dark spots, it changes their overall brightness and temperature, but how exactly does that affect the emission lines?

Alright, so the problem says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the temperature decrease when spots are present? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant portion is covered, the average temperature goes down.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”without spots compared to when it has spots.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation is (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So the ratio is exponential in terms of temperature.

Wait a second, the ratio depends on the temperature. When the overall Teff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ionization and excitation states of the atoms would change. But wait, the problem says it's about the ratio in the stellar photosphere, which is in LTE. So each region (spot or not) is in LTE, but the overall photosphere's average temperature has changed. Hmm, but wait, when spots are present, 40% of the surface is cooler, but the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. Or is the overall photosphere's Teff lower?

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, each spot is cooler than the surrounding. Do the spots have a uniform lower temperature?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire photosphere now has an average Teff of 5500 K. So when spots are present, the star's average Teff is 5500 K, compared to 6000 K without spots.

But wait, in reality, the spots are cooler regions. So when the star has 40% of its surface covered by spots, the total luminosity would be lower because a part of the surface is emitting less. The effective temperature is a measure related to the total luminosity. So the star's overall Teff would be lower when spots are present.

But for the purpose of this problem, when the star has spots, the photospheric Teff is 5500 K, and
