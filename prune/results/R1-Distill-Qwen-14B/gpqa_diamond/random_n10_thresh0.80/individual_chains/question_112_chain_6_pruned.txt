Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems. So, the state is a linear combination of these two, but it's proportional, meaning it's not normalized yet. I should probably normalize it first because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Next, the question is asking about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, because |up> and |down> are two states. So the matrix would be:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Hmm, I think this operator is the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, it becomes [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. So this operator is σ_x multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, but the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates when we measure the operator A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, instead of working with those eigenstates, I can compute the probabilities by projecting |alpha> onto |+x> and |-x>, square the magnitudes, and that will give me the probabilities. The average value of the operator A would then be the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

But first, let me get the normalized state |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2). Let me calculate that.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because the magnitude squared of a complex number a+bi is a² + b².

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the denominator for normalization is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring in each eigenstate of A, which is the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |+x> = (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down> )/sqrt(2).

So, let's express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Substituting |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Factor |up> and |down>:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Now, compare this with the expression for |alpha> from earlier:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, we can set up equations:

(c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
(c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Let me write this as:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7),
Equation 2: (c_+ - c_-) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7).

I can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding the two equations:
2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) 
Simplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7, so 3 sqrt(14) / (2 *7) = 3 sqrt(14)/(14). Wait, maybe I should just keep it
