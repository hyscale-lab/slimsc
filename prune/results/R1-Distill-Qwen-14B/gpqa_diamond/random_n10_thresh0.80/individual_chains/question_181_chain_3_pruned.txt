Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton (pp) chains. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. The pp-III is one of the branches that contributes to the overall neutrino production.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly via the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch is for lower metallicity, but I'm not sure about the details. The pp-III branch—I think that's when a carbon-13 nucleus captures a proton, producing nitrogen-14 and emitting a positron and a neutrino. Oh right, this is part of the CNO cycle, but wait, no. The CNO cycle is a different process. Or is the pp-III part of the pp chains?

Wait, maybe I should recall: the main proton-proton chains. The pp-I chain is the most common, leading to carbon-12. Then, in the pp-II, some of the carbon-12 captures a proton to form nitrogen-13, which decays into carbon-13. Then, the pp-III branch involves carbon-13 capturing a proton to become nitrogen-14, which emits a positron and a neutrino to become carbon-13 again? Or wait, maybe the pp-III is a branch where carbon-13 captures a proton, leading to nitrogen-14, which then emits a positron and a neutrino to become carbon-13. Oh, but I'm a bit confused about the exact details.

But the key point is that the pp-III branch is one of the minor branches in the Sun's core. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrinos it produces?

Neutrinos are produced in each of these branches. The pp-I produces neutrinos when the boron-8 decays, right? And the pp-II and pp-III also produce neutrinos in their respective steps.

Wait, no. The pp-I chain is the main one: two protons collide, go through a series of steps, including the formation of boron-8, which then decays into helium-4 plus a positron and a neutrino. Similarly, the other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) would have their own neutrino emission steps.

So, the pp-III branch would have a certain rate of neutrino production. If it stops, the production from that branch would drop to zero.

But wait, the question is asking about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is band 1 flux over band 2 flux.

So, I need to figure out how the stopping of the pp-III branch affects the neutrino flux in these bands.

First, I should think about the neutrino energies produced by each process. The main pp chain produces neutrinos with energies in certain ranges. For example, the boron-8 decay in the pp-I branch emits a neutrino with a certain energy. Similarly, the other branches might emit neutrinos with different energies.

Wait, the neutrino from the pp-I branch—the one from boron-8 decay—is around 15-20 keV, if I remember correctly. Because boron-8 has a half-life of about two seconds, and the neutrino energy is low. But then, the other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, produce higher-energy neutrinos?

Wait, no. Another possibility: maybe I'm mixing up the neutrino types. The Sun also emits electron neutrinos (νe) via the dominant processes, but there are also other types, but the question says that solar neutrino flavor changes don't matter here.

Wait, but the question is about the energy bands of the neutrinos. So, I think that each process emits neutrinos at a specific energy. For example, the main pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. Wait, but the pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, not the CNO.

Hmm, so the main neutrino emission in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, with the neutrinos having energies around 15-20 keV. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos. Because in pp-II, the carbon-12 captures a proton to form nitrogen-13, which beta decays to carbon-13. Then, the pp-III branch is when carbon-13 captures a proton to form nitrogen-14. This step would emit a higher-energy neutrino.

Wait, let me try to think of the neutrino energies. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the low-energy ones from the pp-I, around ~10-20 keV. The other branches (pp-II and pp-III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, that would affect the higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question specifies the pp-III branch stopped. So, what's the energy of the neutrinos in pp-III?

I think that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 500-1000 keV range, possibly. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but the lower ones remain.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would be affected. Let's say that most neutrinos in band 1 and 2 come from the pp-III branch. If that's
