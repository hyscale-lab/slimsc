Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I'll need to understand the capabilities of each instrument. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no—wait, brighter than 17 means magnitude less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. And HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so up to 16 mag. So HIRES is more sensitive; it can see fainter stars.

The task is to find which stars are observable by both. So each star must have an apparent V magnitude that's less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and also less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, the way it's phrased is brightness as in "brighter than 17"—so the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17 mag. For HIRES, apparent V ≤16 mag. So a star must be ≤16 mag to be seen by both, because that way it's within both's limits.

Wait, but no—if a star is brighter than 16 mag, then its apparent magnitude is less than 16. So for HIRES, it's okay if it's brighter up to 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be ≤16 mag. Because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, but looking at the options, the stars have either absolute magnitudes or apparent magnitudes. So I need to compute the apparent magnitude for each star and see if it's within both spectrographs' capabilities.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes or intrinsic brightness. So I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude using the distance modulus. The formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10),
