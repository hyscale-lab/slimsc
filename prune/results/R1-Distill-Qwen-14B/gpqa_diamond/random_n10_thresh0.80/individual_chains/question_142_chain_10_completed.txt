Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, let me write that down. So ρ is equal to one half times the sum of the outer products of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with their adjoints. So this looks like a mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability, right? Because the coefficients are both 1/2. So ρ is a mixed state, not a pure state.

I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space (the Bloch sphere). Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. Each density matrix can be represented as a vector r in this space. The general form for ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). Oh wait, right, because the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

So the identity matrix I is (1 0; 0 1). The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So if ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then I can compare that to the given ρ.

Let me compute ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2. So ρ is (1/2) * I.

Wait, but wait. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, that would imply that r·σ is zero. So r must be zero because the only way r·σ is zero is when r is zero. Because if r is non-zero, then r·σ would have some non-zero terms.

So if r = (0,0,0), then ρ becomes I/2. Which matches exactly with the given ρ. So the vector r is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is at (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in the Bloch sphere. Comparing the two expressions for \( \rho \), it is clear that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

From the given options:
- **A)** \( r = (1, 1, 0) \) is incorrect.
- **B)** \( r = (0, 0, 1) \) is incorrect.
- **C)** \( r = (0, 0, 0) \) is correct.
- **D)** \( r = (1, 1, 1) \) is incorrect.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
