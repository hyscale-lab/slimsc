Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two probabilities and an average value. Hmm.

First, I think I should find the state |alpha> in the given basis. The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I should normalize it. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. So the normalization condition is |a|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ] = 1.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 = 5.

So sum is 2 +5 =7. So |a|² *7 =1 → |a|=1/sqrt(7). So a is 1/sqrt(7), but since the problem says it's proportional, they might just have the same coefficients and the probabilities are fractions of 1, so in the end, the probabilities are (2/7) and (5/7) for |up> and |down> respectively? Wait, no, let me compute that again.

Wait, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The square of their magnitudes gives the probabilities. So |1+i|² = 2, |2-i|²=5. So the sum is 7. So the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7. So the state is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + (2-i)|down>/sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/√7 and (2-i)/√7.

So the probability of measuring up is |(1+i)/√7|² = (1+1)/7 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857. Similarly, for down, it's |2-i|² /7 = (4 +1)/7=5/7≈0.7143.

Wait, but the question is asking about the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of another operator, not the z-projection. Oh right, the operator in question is the one with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write the matrix A. Since it's 2x2, the indices i and j can be 1 (up) and 2 (down). So A_12 = ħ/2, A_21=ħ/2, and all the diagonal elements (A_11, A_22) are 0.

So matrix A is:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Hmm. Wait, what does this matrix represent? It looks like a spin operator in a different direction, maybe the x or y direction, but scaled. Because, for example, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and similarly for Y. The given matrix has elements (ħ/2) times the off-diagonal elements. So perhaps this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 with off-diagonal elements ±1, so if A_ij = ħ/2 * sigma_ij where sigma is X or Y. For X, it's [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would have 0, ħ/2, ħ/2, 0. So yes, matrix A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices for spin operators are S_x = (ħ/2) sigma_x, so the matrix given is exactly S_x. Because S_x = (ħ/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ].

So the operator in question is the spin-x operator, S_x. Thus, the eigenstates of S_x are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem reduces to finding the probability of the given state |alpha> being projected onto each of the eigenstates of S_x (which are |+x> and |-x>), and then finding the expectation value of S_x.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then compute the probabilities.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of the operator A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenstates can be found by solving (A - λ I) |v> = 0.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ are found from det(A - λ I) = 0.

The determinant equation is (−λ)(−λ) − (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ² = (ħ/2)^2 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = ħ/2: (A - ħ/2 I) |v> =0 → [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] |v> =0. So equations:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1), so |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2, the eigenvector will have v2 = -v1, so (1, -1), so |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2 respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7). Let me write that as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis.

So, in terms of basis vectors |up> = [1;0], |down>=[0;1], the state |alpha> is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7),
  (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, we want to express this state as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, because the operator A's eigenstates are these.

Expressed in the standard basis, |+x> is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] and |-x> is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So any state can be written as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ is the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:
c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

Similarly, factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Compute numerator: (1+i + 2 -i ) = 3 +0i =3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- is the inner product with |-x>:

c_- = [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(2) - (2 -i)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: ( (1-2) + (i +i) ) = (-1 + 2i )

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Now, the probabilities of measuring +x and -x are |c_+|² and |c_-|² respectively.

Compute |c_+|²: (3)^2 / ( (sqrt(14))^2 ) )=9/14 ≈0.6429.

|c_-|²: | (-1 + 2i ) |² / ( (sqrt(14))² ) → compute numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5 →5/14≈0.3571.

Wait wait, 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. But looking at the options, the first option is A) 0.64, 0.36, ... which is close to 9/14 and 5/14, but not exactly. Let me see the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → 9/14 is 0.6428... so that's approximately 0.64, 0.36.

Wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer would match option A.

Wait, but wait:
