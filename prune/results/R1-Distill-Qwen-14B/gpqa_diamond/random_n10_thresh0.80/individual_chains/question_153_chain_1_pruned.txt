Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question has three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C. Each reaction is a Michael addition, I think. I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate or something with a lone pair, like an enamine or maybe another carbonyl.

Alright, let's break down each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a malonate ester, which can form an enolate. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Since the acrylate is in the E configuration, the substituents are trans, but I'm not sure how that affects the product structure.

Wait, when the enolate attacks, the two molecules combine. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. So after the attack, the product would have the two ester groups and the new substituent from the acrylate. Let me visualize the structures.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3O)2C-CH2-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, malonate is CH2(COO-)2. So dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when it forms the enolate, it's the central CH2 that's deprotonated to form the enolate, right?

The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, with the p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon. Wait, no, the substituents for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be p-tolyl-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 connected to the CH2-p-tolyl group. No, wait, maybe I should think of it as the double bond between carbons 1 and
