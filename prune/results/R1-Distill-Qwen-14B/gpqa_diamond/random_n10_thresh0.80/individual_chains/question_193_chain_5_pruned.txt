Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. So, parallax (plx) is 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, they want to know the relationship between the number of stars and distance r.

Wait, the number varies with 1/plx^5. So if I let N be the number of stars, then N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So substituting, N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N ‚àù (d)^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases a lot. But wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express this.

Parallax (plx) is in arcseconds and distance (d) in parsecs are related by d = 1 / plx. So plx = 1/d.

The number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/(plx))^5, where k is some constant. Since plx =1/d, then 1/(plx) = d. So substituting, N = k * d^5.

Wait, so N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases as the distance to the fifth power. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, r. Or wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number density, like the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit distance. Or maybe
