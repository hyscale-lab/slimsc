Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(ψ̄_f(y))(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Let me parse it. Oh, right, I think it's written as L(y) = -λ f f(y) [ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)]. So, the interaction term involves the boson X coupling to fermions. The fermions are represented by ψ_f, and f is probably the type of fermion—like electron, muon, etc.

So, the boson X is interacting with various fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is the key factor in determining which decay channels are possible. Kinematically allowed decays are those where the mass of the boson is at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because you can't have a particle with mass m decaying into two particles each with mass m_f if 2m_f > m, right? So, it's about conservation of energy and the rest mass.

Wait, but wait, the fermions in the decay would have to be such that their combined rest mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. So, each fermion's mass can't be more than 3 GeV, because 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Let me list the known fermion masses. I remember that:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): like 0.0035 GeV (so very light)
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV (also very light)
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV.

So, the boson X is 6 GeV. For a decay to two fermions f and f-bar (like X → f f̄), the condition is m_X ≥ 2m_f.

Looking at each fermion:

- Electrons: 2m_e is negligible, so allowed.
- Muons: 2m_μ is about 0.21 GeV, so allowed.
- Taus: 2m_τ is about 3.55 GeV. Wait, 1.777 * 2 is 3.554, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.
But wait, 3.554 is less than 6
