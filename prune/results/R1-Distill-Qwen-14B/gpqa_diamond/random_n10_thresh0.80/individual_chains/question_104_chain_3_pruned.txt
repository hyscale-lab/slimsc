Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets have about the same mass, and their stars are identical.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift tells us about the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star? Wait, no, I think the velocity semi-amplitude affects the shift. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the RV method detects the velocity of the star's movement towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )... Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, I think the formula relates K, the velocity semi-amplitude, to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible, so it's approximately K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)).

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same mass (like Sun), and both planets have similar masses (Neptune), so M_p and M_star are the same for both. Therefore, K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of P. Because K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), right?

So, K1
