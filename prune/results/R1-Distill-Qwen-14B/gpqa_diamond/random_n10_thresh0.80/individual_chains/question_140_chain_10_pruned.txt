Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions and elements, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me read the question again. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons, so that probably means it's a molecule with equal numbers of each. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which I think is about 4 degrees Celsius because 273 is 0, so 277 is 4. Wait, but melting point of what is around there? Maybe something like water? Or maybe something else. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, water freezes at 273 K, so melting would be 0 C, but maybe B is something else. Hmm.

The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So, maybe the reaction is something like a keto acid reacting with a strong base? Because sometimes when acids react with bases, you get a salt and water. But here, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is something like a carboxylic acid salt, but I'm not entirely sure.

Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm. What reagents are commonly used? Maybe something like NaOH or KOH, which are strong bases. But wait, if X is a heavier isotope, perhaps the constituent element is something with common heavy isotopes, like chlorine or something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y violently. If Y is water, then reacting with a strong base like NaOH would make sense. But Y is a liquid, so it could be water. So if X is a metal, for example, reacting with water could produce H2 gas.

But wait, the gas W has equal neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, which has one proton and one neutron per H atom (if it's H-2). Wait, each H atom has one proton and one neutron? No, wait. Hydrogen usually has one proton and zero neutrons as H-1, or one proton and one neutron as H-2, or one proton and two neutrons as H-3. Oh, but the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule has equal number
