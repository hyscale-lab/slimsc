Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read the details again.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength, which relates to temperature via Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because Wien's Law says λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So same λ_max means same T.

Now, they also measured the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Well, maybe Doppler shift? Oh, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths get shifted. But wait, the question says the peak wavelengths are the same. So does that mean that any Doppler shift from their velocities has already been accounted for? Or does that affect the calculation of their temperatures?

Wait, the question says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. So that would imply that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. But their observed λ_max is the same. So maybe we need to calculate the intrinsic temperatures corrected for Doppler shift?

Wait, no. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the observed λ would be shorter. But since their observed λ_max is the same, that must mean that the Doppler effect is already considered. Oh wait, but the radial velocity is given. So perhaps we need to compute the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their velocities. Because if one is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, which would make its observed λ_max smaller than the intrinsic.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same. So if Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its intrinsic λ_max would be longer than what we observe. Because to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1 which is stationary, the moving star must have a longer intrinsic λ_max.

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's say Star 2 is moving towards us. The Doppler effect would shift its light to shorter wavelengths. So if its intrinsic λ_max is λ0, then we observe λ = λ0 * sqrt( (c - v) / (c + v) ) ), where v is the radial velocity towards us. Because when a source moves towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So for Star_1, which has v=0, the observed λ is its actual λ_max. For Star_2, which has v=700 km/s, the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's. So the intrinsic λ_max of Star_2 must be longer than the observed one. Because moving towards us makes the observed λ shorter.

So let's model this. Let me denote:

λ1_observed = λ1_intrinsic (since v1=0)

λ2_observed = λ2_intrinsic * sqrt( (c - v2) / (c + v2) ) )

But λ1_observed = λ2_observed.

So,

λ1 = λ2_intrinsic * sqrt( (c - v2) / (c + v2) )

So, λ2_intrinsic = λ1 / sqrt( (c - v2)/(c + v2) )

Simplify the denominator: sqrt( (c - v)/(c + v) ) = sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) ) )^-1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express λ2_intrinsic in terms of λ1 and the velocity.

Alternatively, since λ1 = λ
