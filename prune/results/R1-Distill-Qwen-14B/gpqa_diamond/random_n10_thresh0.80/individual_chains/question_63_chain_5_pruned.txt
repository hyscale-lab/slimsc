Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a molecule made of elements X and Y. The model used here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will make it switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm not sure if that's the next in rotation, vibration, or both. Oh, right, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I guess it's considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the transition is from the ground state to the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's a vibrational or rotational change. Or perhaps it's considering the next state in either model. Hmm, maybe I should break down what the fundamental state entails in this model.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number. But the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the same as the rotation-vibration model, includes both rotational and vibrational energies. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The fundamental state in a diatomic molecule's vibration-rotation spectrum is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when they say the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's the v=0, J=0 state. Now, the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably involve the next allowed transition, which could either be a change in vibration or rotation.

Wait, but in the selection rules for diatomic molecules, the allowed transitions are Δv = ±1 for vibration and ΔJ = ±1 for rotation. So the molecule can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? Because if the photon's energy is lower, then the momentum (since p = E/c, and E = hf) will be lower, too.

Wait, so the energy change would be the
