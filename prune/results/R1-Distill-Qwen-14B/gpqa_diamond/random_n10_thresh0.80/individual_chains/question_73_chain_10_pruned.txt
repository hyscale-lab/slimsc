Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics. Oh right, we need to use special relativity formulas.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, how do you calculate relative velocity in relativity? Oh, right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, wait! Both are moving in the same direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. So I think v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So subtracting them gives 0.1c. But wait, no, because the denominator isn't 1, so I need to calculate it properly.

Let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7) c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Wait, but the options have 0.1c and 0.14c. So which one is correct? Option C and D have 0.14c, B has 0.1c. Hmm, so I think the first part is 0.14c, which points towards options C or D.

Now, the second part is total energy. So I need the total relativistic energy of both astronauts. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, v=0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * 1.25 * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, v=0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 3m * 1.1547 * c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

The total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches both parts. Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than our calculation. So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. The formula I used is correct for relative velocity in relativity. So 0.6c minus 0.5c over 1 minus 0
