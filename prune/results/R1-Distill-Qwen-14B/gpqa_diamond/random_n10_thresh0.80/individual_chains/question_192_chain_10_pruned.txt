Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

Alright, so the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find E at point P. Let me think about how charges distribute in such conductors and what the electric fields would look like.

First, I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero because charges rearrange themselves to cancel any internal fields. But this is a conductor with a cavity, so the situation is a bit different.

When you have a conductor with a cavity and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will redistribute. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the charges inside the conductor will separate such that the inner surface of the conductor has an induced charge opposite to the cavity's charge, and the outer surface will have no net charge because the total conductor was neutral.

Wait, right. So the cavity has a charge +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material's charges will be attracted to the opposite of the cavity's charge. But since the conductor as a whole was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. The cavity is inside, and the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q because the +q charge attracts the conductor's electrons. But the conductor's material can't have a net charge, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q, adding up to zero. Hmm, that makes sense.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is a neutral sphere. So when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q (opposite to +q), to shield the conductor's material from the electric field. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of +q because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think: The conductor is neutral. The cavity has +q. The conductor's inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. So the conductor's own charges are rearranged: the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is (inner) + (outer) = (-q) + (+q) = 0. Right, that makes sense.

So the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So P is outside, so the electric field at P should be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner charge distributions don't affect the exterior points—only the total charge on the outer surface does.

So the electric field at P would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because of the shell theorem, a spherical charge distribution's electric field outside the sphere is the same as a point charge at the center.

So the electric field E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait another thing. The charge in the cavity is +q, but the outer surface has +q. So the field outside due to
