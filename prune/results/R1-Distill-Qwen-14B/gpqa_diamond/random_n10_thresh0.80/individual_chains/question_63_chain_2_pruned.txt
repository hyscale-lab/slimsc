Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and a photon causing a transition to the next energy state. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I remember that the non-rigid rotor model is more accurate because it accounts for the bond length changing during rotation, unlike the rigid rotor model which assumes a fixed bond length. But for this problem, I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Maybe it's just a detail about the model we're using, but perhaps the key formulas are similar to the rigid rotor.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, transitions between states depend on the selection rules. For rotational states, the change in angular momentum quantum number ΔJ is usually ±1, but for the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe the selection rules are a bit different? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's the same, so I'll proceed under that assumption.

The problem asks for the momentum of the absorbed photon. I remember that when a photon is absorbed, its energy is absorbed by the molecule, causing a transition between states. The energy of the photon should match the energy difference between the two states.

But wait, the molecule can change both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So maybe the photon's energy is promoting the molecule from the ground state to the next higher state, which could involve a change in vibrational quantum number or rotational. But which one?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. I think that would be the first excited vibrational state (v=1), because vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational ones. Wait, no, wait: actually, rotational energy levels are quantized and the spacing between them is smaller than vibrational. Let me think: for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The spacing between adjacent vibrational levels is
