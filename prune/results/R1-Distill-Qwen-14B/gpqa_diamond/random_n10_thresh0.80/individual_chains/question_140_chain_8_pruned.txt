Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll go step by step.

So the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and it's noted that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

First, let's break down the given information.

1. **Reaction of X with Y:** Violently reacting, releasing gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule is probably something like H2O, NH3, or maybe CO2? Wait, no, same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think: for a molecule, each atom contributes. So if W is a diatomic molecule, for example, each atom has same number of protons and neutrons.

Like, if W is H2O: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the heavier isotope, like O-18). Wait, but if W's molecule has same neutrons and protons, maybe each atom in the molecule has equal n and p.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has one C and two O. Each O is 8p, 8n. C is 6p, 6n. So in CO2, total would be (6+16) p and (6+16) n. Wait, but the molecule's total? Or each atom? The question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So in the entire molecule, number of protons equals number of neutrons.

So, for example, H2O: H has 1p, 0n each. O has 8p, 8n. So total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CH4? No, wait, we're looking for a molecule where the total number of protons equals the total neutrons. Let me think of possible gases that fit this.

Maybe CO? But CO has C (6p,6n) and O (8p,8n). Total p:14, n:14. Oh wait, that works. So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So gas W could be CO.

But wait, CO is a gas. Also, another possibility: N2. Each N is 7p,7n. So N2 has 14p and 14n. So same thing. So W could be N2.

Alternatively, maybe something like OH-? No, that's not a molecule. Or maybe O2: each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 would have 16p and 16n. That fits.

Wait, but O2 is a possible gas. So what's more likely here?

I also need to think about the reaction between X and Y. What liquids react violently to release a gas? Maybe something like a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, sodium carbonate and hydrochloric acid. But then the
