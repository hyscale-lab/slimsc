Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read through the problem again.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.040 liters. 

I think the first step is to calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, its concentration will change when diluted. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be found using Molarity = moles/volume (L). So moles = M * V.

Moles of CH3COOH before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so the new concentration is moles / new volume. The new volume is 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So diluted to 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, that seems right. Dilution just adds more solvent without reacting, so moles stay the same, but concentration halves because volume doubles. Wait, no, 0.02 L to 0.04 L is double the volume, so concentration goes from 0.05 to 0.025. Yes.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So when we titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

But the question is about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the 25% titration point. So, what's 25% of the total volume required for equivalence?

Wait, to find the equivalence point, I need to find how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid.

So moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =
