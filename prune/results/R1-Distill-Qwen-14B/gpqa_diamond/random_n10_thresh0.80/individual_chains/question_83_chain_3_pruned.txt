Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about titration, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and I think the correct one is either D or maybe B, but I'm not sure yet.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction between them would be a neutralization where the acid donates a proton to the hydroxide. The pH will depend on how much of the acid has been neutralized.

Wait, the first step is diluting the acetic acid. So initially, we have 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 mL of water, the total volume becomes 40 mL. I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, we need to find how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? That's when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 40 mL is 0.04 L.

The NaOH has a molarity of 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

So at equivalence point, 10 mL of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 mL of NaOH.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of that amount has been added. So yes, 2.5 mL.

Now, let's think about the two scenarios: 25% tit
