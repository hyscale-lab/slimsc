Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four statements to evaluate, options A to D. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Also, the evolution operator (like time evolution) is a unitary matrix. So let's think about each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. Hmm. The exponential of a matrix e^X would typically be unitary if X is skew-Hermitian, because the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix is unitary. Wait, but what's X like? Let me check the matrix X.

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1 -i

I need to check if X is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix equals its conjugate transpose. So let's see. The conjugate transpose of X would have entries:

For (1,1): i becomes -i. But the (1,1) of X is i, so the (1,1) of X† is -i. But X's (1,1) is i, so X† would have (1,1) as -i, which is not equal to X's (1,1)=i. So X is not Hermitian. Wait, unless there's some other condition.

So if X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. If e^X isn't unitary, then multiplying a vector by e^X would change its norm because unitary transformations preserve the norm. So if e^X isn't unitary, then multiplying a vector by it would change the norm.

But wait, when is e^A unitary? I think if A is skew-Hermitian, meaning A† = -A, then e^A is unitary. So first, is X skew-Hermitian? Let's check X's conjugate transpose.

X†:

First row: -i, 1, -2i
Second row: 1, 0, 2i
Third row: -2i, -1, i

Wait, X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† would swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates. So:

X† would be:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Column 2 becomes Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, 1* → 1, 0, 1
Column 3 becomes Row 3: (2i)*, 1*, (-i)* →-2i, 1, i

Wait, actually, let's compute each element properly. X is:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

So X† (conjugate transpose) would be:

First row of X† is the conjugate of the first column of X:
i → -i,
1 → 1,
2i → -2i → So first row: [-i, 1, -2i]

Second row of X† is the conjugate of the second column of X:
-1 → 1,
0 → 0,
-1 → -1 → So second row: [1, 0, -1]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the second column of X is [ -1, 0, -1 ]? No wait, the columns are:

First column of X: i, 1, 2i → conjugate is -i, 1, -2i.

Second column of X: -1, 0, -1 → conjugate is 1, 0, 1.

Third column: 2i, 1, -i → conjugate is -2i, 1, i.

So X† would be:

[-i, 1, -2i;
 1, 0, 1;
 -2i, 1, i]

Wait, wait, let me arrange them properly. So columns become rows.

X† would be:

Row 1: (i)*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, 1* →1, 0, 1
Row 3: (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* →-2i, -1, i.

Wait, the third row of X is [2i, -1, -i], so the conjugate of that is [-2i, 1, i].

So X† is:

[ -i, 1, -2i ]
[ 1, 0, 1 ]
[ -2i, -1, i ]

Now, let's see if X† = -X.

X is:

[ i, -1, 2i ]
[ 1, 0, 1 ]
[ 2i, -1, -i ]

So -X would be:

[ -i, 1, -2i ]
[ -1, 0, -1 ]
[ -2i, 1, i ]

Comparing to X†:

X† first row: [-i, 1, -2i
