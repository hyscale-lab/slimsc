Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that the stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are given with different exponents, so I'm guessing I need to think about how parallax relates to distance and then how the number of stars depends on that.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance. So a smaller plx means the star is farther away. I remember that the formula for distance d is approximately 1/px (in parsecs) when px is in arcseconds. So d = 1/px. So as px increases, the distance decreases.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So how does the number of stars (density) change with parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume, right?

Wait, the number per unit volume is the same because of uniform distribution. So if I consider a spherical shell at a certain distance, the volume of that shell would determine how many stars are in it. The volume of a thin spherical shell with radius r and thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4π r² dr times the uniform density n (number per unit volume).

Since px is 1/d, then d = 1/px. So substituting, r is 1/px. So the volume element in terms of parallax would involve r squared, which is (1/px)^2. But wait, the shell's thickness in parallax terms would be a bit more involved.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of changing parallax. Suppose I have a range of parallaxes from px to px + dpx. Each px corresponds to a distance d = 1/px. So the volume of stars in that range would be the number of stars in that shell.

Wait, but the volume between two distances d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So number of stars in that shell is 4π d² dd * n. But since d = 1/px, then substituting:

Number of stars = 4π (1/px)^2 * (dpx) *
