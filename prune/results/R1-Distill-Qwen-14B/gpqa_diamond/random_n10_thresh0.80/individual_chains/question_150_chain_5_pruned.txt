Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a couple of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since it's three double bonds and a ring), and then another double bond and a ring? Or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm, so this might be an aldehyde group.
- 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). Maybe aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted? Because in para substitution, you often get two doublets each integrating to 2H. Wait, but depending on the neighboring groups, maybe it's a substituent on a benzene ring.
- 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d, 2H). Also aromatic. So perhaps two different sets of aromatic protons, maybe from two benzene rings.
Wait, but the compound has C8H9NO, so maybe two phenyl groups? Because each benzene ring is C6H5, but that would give us C12. Oh wait, no, the molecular formula is C8. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the compound has one benzene ring and another structure.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think. If there's an aldehyde group, then the 9.72 ppm peak would be that. Then the other signals could be from substituents attached to the benzene ring or another structure.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests perhaps exchange with protons, maybe an -OH group adjacent, or maybe protons near an electronegative atom. The 3.66 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That seems like it could be adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alkoxy group. Or perhaps a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

So putting it together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. If one of them is a benzene ring (6 carbons), that leaves 2 more carbons. Hmm, but wait, perhaps not a benzene ring? Alternatively, a pyridine ring,
