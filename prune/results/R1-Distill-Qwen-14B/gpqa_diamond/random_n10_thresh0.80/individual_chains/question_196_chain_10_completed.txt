Alright, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, okay, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are probably different.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but since this is relativistic, I think option C isn't the right answer here.

Wait, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy includes rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that tie in with the oscillator's potential and kinetic energy?

In the case of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, it's (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy at any point is the sum of potential and kinetic.

At maximum displacement (x=A), the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. That potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right in relativity. Because in relativity, the energy includes rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, the potential energy is just (1/2)kA², and the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic plus potential.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator is the rest mass energy plus the potential energy at maximum amplitude. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So at that point, the kinetic energy is E_total - mc², which would be (1/2)kA².

Wait, but no, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So setting E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So (gamma -1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v.

Let me write that down:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²).

Then, 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but that would mean that sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmm, let me compute that. Let me let a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Which can be written as [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding the numerator: 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor out a in numerator: a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c^2) which is, given the options, perhaps this is leading towards one of the choices.

Looking at the options:

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, no, option D's sqrt has 1 - [1/(1 + ...)^2], which would be matching our expression for v^2/c^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate v_max^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2} ].

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2} ), where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))² )

Wait, let me check the options.

Option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have here. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the total energy correct?

Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic plus potential. But when at maximum displacement, all the energy beyond rest mass is potential. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)k A^2.

But wait, that might not account for relativistic effects correctly. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy expression is the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps for a relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2) k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c^2.

In that case, the total energy would be (gamma) m c^2 = rest energy + kinetic energy.

So, when the oscillator is at x = A, all the energy beyond rest is potential.

So,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2) k A².

Thus, gamma = 1 + (1/2)k A²/( m c^2 ).

Wait, no, that would be (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) multiplied by m c², so (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) is a dimensionless term.

Wait, wait, let me clarify.

gamma = [m c² + (1/2) k A² ] / (m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

So, then, proceeding as before, and the same conclusion.

So the expression for v_max would be option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Yes, that matches what I derived.

Wait, but another option, option A, has a sqrt with 1 + 1/(1 - ... )^2. Hmm, but when I derived it, the denominator was (1 + a)^2 in the 1/( ... ) term.

So I think option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \) and maximum amplitude \( A \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy principles. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. At \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), so the total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at equilibrium:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect terms under the square root.
- **Option C** is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
