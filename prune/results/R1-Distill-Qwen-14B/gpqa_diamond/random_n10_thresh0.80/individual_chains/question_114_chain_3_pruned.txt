Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with another reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each reaction is doing. Let me start with the first reaction.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Reacting it with NaCN. Wait, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, what's the condition here? NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes C-O-CN after addition? Or wait, maybe it's more of a substitution? No, wait, no substitution here. The carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide ion.

Wait, in the presence of an acid, maybe? Because sometimes ketone reactions with nucleophiles require acid catalysis. Oh, right! The formation of cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a new alcohol and nitrile group.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that product. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add across the carbonyl. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, butanenitrile is a four-carbon chain with a nitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think: The butanenitrile part is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butane is 4 carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Or maybe CH2CH2CH2CN is pentanenitrile. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN with four carbons: CH2CH2CNCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN
