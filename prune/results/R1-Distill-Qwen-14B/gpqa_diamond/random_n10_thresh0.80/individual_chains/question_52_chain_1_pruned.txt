Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They're looking at the ratio between level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula I recall is something like:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels.
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E_i and E_j are the energies of the respective levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio n1/n2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K compared to 6000 K), but the spot coverage affects the observed temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The star's spots are cooler regions, right? Because when spots cover part of the star, the observed effective temperature drops. So, 40% coverage leads to an average Teff of 5500 K. But how does this affect the photospheric temperature where Ti is present?

I'm a bit confused. The overall Teff is the average, but the photosphere (the outer layer where light is emitted) has a certain temperature. But if spots are cooler, maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present. Or perhaps the spots are regions where the temperature is lower than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, I think the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but when they aren't, it's 6000 K. So, in both cases, the photosphere has a uniform temperature of 6000 K and 5500 K respectively.

Wait no, that can't be right. Because if the star's surface has spots, the effective temperature is a weighted average. But the photosphere is still the same layer, right? So, when spots are present, the photosphere's temperature is a mix of the spotted and unspotted regions. Wait, no, perhaps the spots are cooler regions within the photosphere. So when the star has spots, some parts of the photosphere are at lower temperatures, but the overall average is 5500 K.

But for the purposes of the Boltzmann factor, the temperature used would be the local temperature of the photosphere. However, if the spots and the surrounding regions have different temperatures, then the observed line ratios would be an average of the contributions from both regions.

Wait, but the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spots and non-spots) would obey LTE conditions. But when we observe the ratio, we are probably seeing an average effect.

Alternatively, maybe when the spots are present, the effective temperature we observe is lower, but the actual photospheric temperature (the region we're looking at) is the same as before. No, that doesn't make sense. Because the star's overall Teff is determined by the surface area and temperature of each region.

Wait, perhaps the problem simplifies it by assuming that when the star has 40% of its surface covered by spots, the overall (average) photospheric temperature is 5500 K. So, the effective temperature is the average of the spotted and unspotted regions.

But wait, the effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πσR²Teff^4. So if part of the surface is cooler, the overall Teff would be lower than the unspotted case.

So, in this case, when 40% of the surface is spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. But the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures. Let me think: let’s say the non-spotted 60% of the surface has a higher temperature, and the 40% spots have a lower temperature. But the problem gives us the overall Teff as 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So, the average Teff is lower. But the question is about how the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere changes. Are the Ti atoms in regions that are at the average Teff, or in the individual regions?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating the entire photosphere as having a uniform temperature. So when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, whereas without spots it's 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. But the individual regions (the spots and the non-spots) have their own temperatures. So, perhaps the 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (like 5000 K?), and the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. But the problem doesn't state the spot temperature directly.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the overall temperature of the photosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the presence of spots reduces the effective temperature, and the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K. But that can't be right because spots
