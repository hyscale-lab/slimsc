Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us about the stability of complexes. The higher the beta value, the more stable the complex.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. The blue dithiocyanato complex, I think that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So that would be the complex with two SCN- ligands. So I need to find the fraction of Co in that particular complex.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula for the distribution of metal complexes. The formula involves the stability constants and the concentration of the ligand. Oh right, the fraction f_n for the nth complex is [CoL_n] divided by the total [Co], which is the sum of all species.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then add them up. But wait, there are four beta values here. Let me see: beta1 is for [CoSCN]^+, beta2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, beta3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and beta4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe I should double-check the charge. Because Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So [CoL_n]^charge would be 2 - n. So:

n=1: Co(SCN) → charge is 2-1=+1 → [Co(SCN)]^+
n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → charge 0 → [Co(SCN)_2]
n=3: Co(SCN)_3 → 2-3=-1 → [Co(SCN)_3]-
n=4: Co(SCN)_4 → 2-4=-2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-

Wait, but the stability constants are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. So which one corresponds to which complex? I think the order is the number of ligands. So beta1 is the first complex (n=1), beta2 is n=2, etc.

So the fractions for each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (K_n * [L]^n) / (sum over all K_n * [L]^n + [M])

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction for each complex is (beta_n * [SCN]^n) / (sum of beta_i * [SCN]^i for i=0 to 4 + [Co^2+]).

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the free ion, which would be the term when n=0. So the denominator is the sum for each possible n (0 to 4) of beta_n * [SCN]^n, plus the free Co^
