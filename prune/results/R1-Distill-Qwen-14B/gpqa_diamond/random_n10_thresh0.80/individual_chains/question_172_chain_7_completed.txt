Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution tells us how particles distribute among different energy states based on temperature.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the number of atoms in that higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor here.

The Boltzmann equation is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k_B T) ). Here, N_i is the number of particles in state i, and E is the energy. If we're comparing two stars, star_1 and star_2, and assuming the same energy difference and same statistical weights (since it's the same element and same energy levels), then the ratio simplifies.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So E_i - E_j is that value. Let's denote this as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

The ratio of the excited states in star 1 to star 2 is N1/N2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ) ). Because when we take the ratio of N1 and N2, it's (N1/Nj) / (N2/Nj) ), which gives the ratio as exp( (ΔE/(k_B T2) - ΔE/(k_B T1) ) ).

Wait, let me make sure. The full ratio is (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Since we're comparing same transitions for both stars, g_i and g_j are the same for each, so they cancel out. So N1/N2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k_B T1) ) / exp( -(ΔE)/(k_B T2) ). Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ).

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step. Let me write the ratio for each star.

For star_1: N1 = N_j1 * (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

For star_2: N2 = N_j2 * (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Since the populations are N_j for each (like the lower level), but I think the ratio N1/N2 would be (N_j1 / N_j2) * exp( (ΔE/k_B)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, let me re-express N1/N2. Let's say N1 is the number in the excited state for star_1, N2 same for star_2. So, using the same statistical weights and same lower level N_j (but I'm not sure if N_j is the same for both stars; perhaps they don't have to be. But maybe the ratio N_j doesn't matter because it's part of the ratio, but since we're comparing two stars, perhaps the overall ratio can consider that N_j1 and N_j2 could differ. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to take the ratio of the ratios. Let me think. The ratio of the excited to lower state in each star is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, (N1/N_j1) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (N2/N_j2) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

But the problem states that N1 is twice N2. So N1 = 2 N2.

But how about N_j1 and N_j2? Since the lower level populations are N_j, which depends on T as well. Hmm, I think this complicates the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the total number of iron atoms is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's given.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of excitation: N1/N2 = 2.

But from the Boltzmann factors:

N1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) * N_j1

N2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ) * N_j2

So, N1/N2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ) ] * (N_j1 / N_j2 )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) * (N_j1 / N_j2 )

But the problem says N1/N2 = 2. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) * (N_j1 / N_j2 )

Hmm, that introduces another term. But perhaps we can assume that for both stars, the ratio N_j1/N_j2 is the same as the ratio of the lower levels. Wait, but N_j is the number of atoms in the lower energy level for each star. Hmm, but unless we have more information, we might not be able to proceed in that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio of the populations (excited to total) is being compared, which would imply that N1/(N1 + N_j1) for star_1 and N2/(N2 + N_j2) for star_2. But that's more complicated.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem states that the excitation is twice as much, perhaps the ratio N1/N2 = 2. But how does that tie into the temperatures?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of the probabilities. The excitation probability is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio of the probabilities for each star would be P1/P2 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ) )

So P1/P2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But in the problem, it's the number of excited atoms that is twice as much in star_1, but I need to think about how this relates to the probabilities. If the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to the probability multiplied by the total number of atoms.

Wait, but without knowing the total number of atoms, perhaps we need to assume that the ratio of the probabilities is equal to the ratio of the excited atoms, assuming same number of atoms in both stars. But the problem doesn't say that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the statistical weights are the same and that the ratio N1/N2 = 2, so 2 = (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)))/(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) )

Which simplifies to 2 = exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k_B) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, but let me recheck. If 2 = exp(a), then ln(2) = a.

So, a is ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), right?

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Wait, but let's rearrange this. Let's factor out the negative sign.

Alternatively, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, I think I got the sign wrong. Let me correct that.

Because [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the equation I have is ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which would be the same as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, no. Let me compute it:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) 

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But wait, the question is about the relation between T1 and T2. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but the equation I have is ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k_B)] times (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But none of the options have ΔE or k_B in them. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed a negative sign earlier. Let me go back.

The ratio N1/N2 = 2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B) [1/T2 - 1/T1} )

Wait, no, because the ratio is N1/N2 = 2, and from the earlier expression, N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B) [1/T2 - 1/T1} )

So 2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logs:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k_B)] ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But the options don't have any terms with ΔE or k_B. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should have considered the reciprocal. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio is N1 = 2 N2.

The Boltzmann factor for star_1 is (N1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * N_j1

Similarly for star_2: (N2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * N_j2

Assuming that the lower level population N_j is proportional to a certain factor, but perhaps the ratio N_j1/N_j2 is the same as N_j for each star, which is (g_j) exp( ... ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the lower level population is the same for both stars, which would allow N_j1 = N_j2.

If that's the case, then the ratio becomes N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So 2 = exp(ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But again, the options don't have any terms with ΔE or k_B, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the ratio applies.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the ratio of the excitation probabilities. Let me assume that the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: n1 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The ratio n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Given that n1/n2 = 2, so:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let's factor the 1/T2 - 1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But again, the problem is that the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct variables.

Wait, maybe the expression is rearranged in terms of T1 and T2 without involving ΔE or k. Let's see.

Wait, the question gives ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute ΔE/(k_B). What's the value of k_B (Boltzmann constant)?

k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Wait, because 1.38e-23 J/K multiplied by K gives J.

So,

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k_B * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K? Wait,

Wait, if k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = k_B * T_0 => T_0 = ΔE / k_B = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = (k_B * 1 K ) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ]

Because,

ΔE/(k_B) = T_0 = 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = [1 K ] * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation would be option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the ratio of populations in two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Here, \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the populations of the excited energy level in star_1 and star_2, respectively, \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the effective temperatures of the stars.

The problem states that \(N_1 = 2N_2\), so:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E / k_B = 1 \, \text{K}\) (since \(\Delta E = k_B \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\)):

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Incorrectly suggests a simple ratio of temperatures without considering the energy levels.
- **Option B**: Incorrectly introduces a sum of temperatures in the numerator.
- **Option C**: Incorrectly includes a squared term in the denominator, which is not consistent with the Boltzmann distribution.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
