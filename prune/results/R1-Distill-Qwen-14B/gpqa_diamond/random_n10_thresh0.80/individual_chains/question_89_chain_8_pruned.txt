Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide addition, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Alright, let's start by figuring out what each step does.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? It's a polycyclic structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms in positions 1 and 3. When it's heated with a strong base like KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction. That's because dihalides often undergo dehydrohalogenation with bases to form alkenes.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules. The base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the two bromides leave, forming a double bond. The product would be 1,3-diamantadiene? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-diamantadiene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the positions. Let me think: if we have two bromines on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are two carbons apart around the structure. So when you eliminate two HBr, maybe the double bonds form between 1 and 2 and 3 and 4? Or perhaps it creates a conjugated diene.

Wait, no, let's think about the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent vertices. So when we eliminate two bromides, each from C1 and C3, the elimination would form two double bonds? Or maybe a single conjugated diene?

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-diamantadiene, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but more likely, it's an elimination to form a diene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, that doesn't make sense with an elimination product. Because elimination would form an alkene, which has a peak around 1650-1600 cm-1 in IR for the C=C stretch. But here, the IR is 1
