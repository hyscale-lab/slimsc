Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, let's think about the first part. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Adding NaCN and a reagent A. Wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide (like NaCN), it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but wait, what are the conditions for that? Oh right, ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles. In the case of NaCN, the nitrile would add to the carbonyl. But wait, I think when you add HCN, you get the addition of H and CN. But NaCN is a source of CN- which is a good nucleophile, but it's a weak base, so maybe you need some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen so that the carbonyl becomes a better electrophile.

So, for the addition of CN- to a ketone, I think H+ (acid) is needed as a catalyst. So reagent A could be H3O+ (like in option A and B). Alternatively, maybe it's something else like H2SO4, but in the options, the choices are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: the cyanide is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and the two methyl groups. So, that suggests that the ketone has undergone addition of CN- and then perhaps some protonation and tautomerism?

Wait, no, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or perhaps (CH3)2CH(CN)OH? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Structure: O=C(CH2CH3). Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's a three-carbon chain with the ketone in the middle. So like (CH3)2CO.

When NaCN adds, the nitrile group would add to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? Hmm
