Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, pretty stable and has multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, I think.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. KOH is a strong base, and in such conditions, maybe an elimination reaction happens. Wait, dibromides often undergo dehydrohalogenation when treated with strong bases, leading to alkenes. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If it's heated with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination to form a double bond. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar? Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination, but with two bromides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dielimination reaction, forming a ring-strained alkene. But wait, the NMR data might help.

The NMR of product 1 shows: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, so product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe it's not elimination but a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH could also lead to substitution. But with two bromides, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form an oxide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide formation? Because when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes an epoxide forms if it's adjacent. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions on adamantane are probably not adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, if it's KO
