Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Let me first understand what's being asked. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the overall operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's a sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector. Oh wait, because the direction is arbitrary, along n, which is in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector, probably expressed as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, no, the x-z plane would mean that the angle φ is 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. Wait, maybe not. Wait, wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis, but with φ=0. Wait, no, because φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis, right? So if the direction is in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or 180 degrees, I think. Hmm. So n could be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, actually, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero. So the direction vector n is (sinθ * cos0, 0, sinθ * sin0 + cosθ) which simplifies to (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So I think that's correct.

So the operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute. So the operator P along n is P_n = P_x n_x +
