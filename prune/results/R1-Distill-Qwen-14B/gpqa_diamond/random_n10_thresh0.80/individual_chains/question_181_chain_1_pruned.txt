Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos produced by the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production has different processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? I think the pp-I branch is the dominant one, and pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? No, I think pp-I is the main, and others are minor. So if the pp-III branch stops, would that significantly affect the neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions in the Sun. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from the proton-proton chain. Oh, and also the boron neutrinos from the triple-alpha process in the core, but those are for heavier elements. Wait, but in the pp-III branch, I think they produce neutrinos as well. So if that stops, the number of neutrinos from that part would drop.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So what determines the neutrino energies?

I recall that neutrinos emitted from the Sun have a spectrum. The higher-energy neutrinos come from different parts of the Sun. For example, the electron neutrinos from the main pp-I reactions produce a spectrum peaking at lower energies, like around a few hundred keV. The pp-III branch, I think, might produce higher-energy neutrinos because the reactions involve more energetic particles?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The main pp chain produces neutrinos mainly via the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-4 nuclei. The neutrinos from this process have a certain energy distribution. The pp-III branch is a minor part of the proton-proton chain. So, if the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux from that specific part would decrease, but the main part (pp-I) continues.

But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch stops. So the flux from pp-III goes away, but the rest (like pp-I and maybe
