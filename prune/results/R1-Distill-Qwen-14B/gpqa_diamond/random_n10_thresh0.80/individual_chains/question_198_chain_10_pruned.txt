Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems yet. But I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. There are stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. I remember that CoSCN^+ is usually blue, but maybe the dithiocyanato is another form. Oh right, Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the blue one, I think. So the problem is asking for the percentage of this particular complex among all the cobalt species.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, okay. I think these β values are the formation constants for the complexes. So βn would be the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex. So for each complex, the β is the product of the formation steps up to that complex.

Wait, no, I think each β is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, and so on.

So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^2−n+2? Or wait, what's the charge? Co is +2, each SCN^- is -1, so for n SCN, the charge would be 2 - n. So:

n | complex | charge
1 → CoSCN^+ (2-1=+1)
2 → Co(SCN)_2^0 (2-2=0)
3 → Co(SCN)_3^- (2-3=-1)
4 → Co(SCN)_4^2− (2-4=−2)

Wait that doesn't seem right. Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So when you have n SCN- attached, the total charge would be 2 - n*(1), because each SCN is -1. So:

n=1 → 2-1=+1 → CoSCN^+
n=2 → 2-2=0 → Co(SCN)_2
n=3 → 2-3=−1 → Co(SCN)_3^-
n=4 → 2-4=−2 → Co(SCN)_4^2−

Wait, I think that's right. So the complexes are CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^2−.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but sometimes the stability constant is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for the first complex, CoSCN^+, the formation would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+
β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Similarly for the second complex, it's the formation from the first complex plus another SCN:

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0
β2 here would be the stepwise formation constant, which is the second β given as 40.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes the overall formation constant β2 would be the product of β1 and β2. So β_total for Co(SCN)_2^0 would be β1 * β2.

Wait, but the question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps βn is the cumulative formation constant for the nth complex.
