Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with stars and their atmospheres, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is important. LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is emitting as if it's in equilibrium with a blackbody at a certain temperature, called the effective temperature.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a particular energy state. Oh right, the number of atoms in an excited state is related to the Boltzmann distribution.

Boltzmann distribution equation is something like the population of a state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy of the state, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. So for two different states, the ratio of their populations depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but the question isn't about two different energy levels, but the same level in two different stars. So for each star, the population of an excited state compared to the ground state would follow the Boltzmann factor. Let me think: the ratio of the populations of two energy states (n and m) is (n_m / n_n) = exp( -(E_m - E_n)/(kT) ). 

In this problem, the energy difference between the considered levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote E as that energy difference. So for star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Wait, no. The question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, the ratio (n1/n_ground1) is twice (n2/n_ground2)?

Wait no, perhaps I should model it as the excitation relative to the ground state. Let me denote the ground state as the lower energy level, and the excited state as the higher one. So, the number of atoms in the excited state is given by n_excited = N * (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two states, and g's are the statistical weights. If we assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (same element, same transition probably), then the ratio n1_excited / n2_excited = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))].

But wait, the problem states that n1 is twice n2. So, n1/n2 = 2. So the ratio would be exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2.

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2. Taking natural logs on both sides: (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, let's write that out:

(ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Alternatively, rearranged:

(ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, that's correct.

So, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But wait, the question gives the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the constants. Oh, but the options don't include ΔE or k, so the equation must relate T1 and T2 in a way that the constants cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T
