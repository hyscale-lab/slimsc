Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), leading to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile, often used in nucleophilic substitution reactions. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN- from NaCN, what usually happens? Oh right! It's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The ketone carbonyl becomes an alcohol after the addition, but wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon. So, for butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures to see.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the naming wrong. Butanenitrile has four carbons. Let me count: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(C(OH)CH2CH3)CN? Or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused about the structure, but regardless, the key point is the reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition. Oh! Maybe it's a substitution. Wait, no, because ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution unless under certain conditions. Oh, wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yes, that rings a bell. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with CN- in an acidic solution. The mechanism involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, then protonation and formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, butan-2-one plus NaCN (which provides CN-) in acidic conditions would form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). So in the first reaction, A is the acid.

Wait, but what's the role of A? Let me think about the reaction conditions. The cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, but for that, the
