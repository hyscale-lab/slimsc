Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Alright, let me break it down.

So, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, and they're all in an isolated system. 12 of these are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has one charge, and the other 12 are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters each.

Wait, so the fixed charge is at P, and the others are all at a fixed distance from P. So, I guess the system's configuration is such that the 12 charges form a sphere or something around the fixed charge. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe the exact arrangement isn't important because all the 12 are equally distant from P. Or does it matter? Hmm.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. So, I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, maybe the way to compute this is to consider each charge's contribution to the potential at P, and then the interactions between the other charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The potential energy of the system comes from two sources: the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 1
