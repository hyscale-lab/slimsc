Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the distribution of stars in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options given are different mathematical relationships, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution—so does that mean the density of stars is the same at all distances? Or does it refer to the sky area? I think it means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Oh wait, no, because we're considering parallax, which relates to distance. So maybe it's about the density in three-dimensional space.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars should depend on the volume of space we're considering. Volume increases with the cube of the distance. So for stars at a certain distance, the number of stars in a shell at that distance would depend on the volume of that shell.

Wait, let's model this. Let's say the parallax is p. Since p = 1/d (d in parsecs), then d = 1/p. So p is inversely proportional to distance.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, let's say n. So the number of stars between distance d and d + dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. Oh right, and r is d here.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the range of parallax would be dp. So we need to express the number of stars in terms of dp.

Let me try to make the substitution. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because when d increases, p decreases. So maybe I should write the integral in terms of p.

The number of stars N in a shell at distance d
