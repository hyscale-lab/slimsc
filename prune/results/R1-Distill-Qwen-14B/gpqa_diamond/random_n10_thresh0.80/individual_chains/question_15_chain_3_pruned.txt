Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by recalling what affects the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the question says both have circular orbits, so alignment is the same. Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, no, the probability of the planet's orbit being edge-on enough to cause a transit. Oh right, the transit probability isn't 100% even if the planet is in the right size range. The probability is higher if the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, maybe the other way around.

Wait, I think the probability of transit is proportional to (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the transit happens when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. So if the star's size is smaller relative to the planet's distance, the planet's path is a smaller area, making the chance of crossing our line of sight smaller. So the probability is higher when R_star is larger relative to a. Or maybe it's inversely proportional. Hmm.

Wait, I should think about the formula. The probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else, maybe the impact parameter, but for a circular orbit, the maximum is when the orbit is edge-on. But for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R_star / a
