Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me try to parse it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, but wait, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, right? Because when they measured, none were found outside that range. So that must mean the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the given wave function isn't zero there. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. The wave function provided is probably valid only where the particle can exist. So the part they're considering is where x is between 1 and 3. But the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization.

So, the wave function is Ïˆ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that can't be right because the square root of 1+x would be real only if 1+x is positive, which it is in the given region x=1 to 3. But wait, I'm trying to think about wave functions. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have real and imaginary parts, but when you square it (for probability), you take the absolute square. 

But wait, the question says that when measuring, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(
