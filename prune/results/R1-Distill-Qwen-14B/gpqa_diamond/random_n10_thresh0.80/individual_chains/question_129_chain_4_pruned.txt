Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are several steps given, each reacting a compound to form the next. Let's break down each step and the hints to find the answer.

First, let me list out the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
Hint b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each being a cyclic ketone. So, E is likely a ketone.

Starting with the reaction steps. Let's think about each step and what kind of reactions they involve.

1. A + HCN → B. So HCN addition. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, like in ketones or aldehydes. So A is probably a cyclic ketone. The product B would have an -CN group added.

2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 and catalysts like Pd usually reduce triple bonds to single bonds, but in this case, B comes from adding HCN to A. So HCN addition to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin. So B is a cyanohydrin. When you reduce that with H2 and Pd, you're probably reducing the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?) Wait, no, wait. Cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. When you hydrogenate that, the nitrile group (-CN) would become a methylene group (-CH2-), because H2 adds across the triple bond. So the cyanide group becomes CH2NH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when you hydrogenate a nitrile group (R-CN), you typically get R-CH2-NH2 under certain conditions. But here, the reaction is with H2 and Pd. I think in the presence of a poison like quinoline, Pd would catalyze the hydrogenation of nitriles to amines. Alternatively, without such a poison, maybe it just adds hydrogen to triple bonds.

Wait, the cyanohydrin would have a structure like R-C(OH)-CN. So the nitrile is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. When you hydrogenate the nitrile group, you're reducing the triple bond (C≡N) to a single bond. So R-C(OH)-CH2-NH2? Or maybe R-CH(OH)-CH2NH2? No, wait, the cyanide group is R-C≡N. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes R-CH2-NH2. So in the case of the cyanohydrin, which is R-C(OH)-CN, the nitrile would be converted to R-C(OH)-CH2-NH2? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe the hydrogenation adds H2 across the nitrile, turning it into an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin has a ketone group and a nitrile group attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure of A. Since A is a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would create a cyanohydrin. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, adding HCN would give cyclopentane cyanohydrin, which is cyclopentane with an OH and CN group on adjacent carbons. Then, when you hydrogenate the nitrile
