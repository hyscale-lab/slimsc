Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So I guess I need to calculate the decay length somehow.

Wait, decay length has to do with how far a particle travels before decaying, right? The formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the mean lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, since Γ is the width, which is the total decay width, yes.

Wait, but there's another point. The energy given is the production energy, which is higher than the mass. So the particle is produced with some kinetic energy. How does that affect things? Oh, right, the mean decay distance depends on the velocity of the particle. Because a faster-moving particle will travel further before decaying.

So the steps are probably:

1. Find the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity of the meson using its energy and mass.
3. Calculate the decay length as v * τ.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy E is given, so I can find the momentum p. Then from E² = p²c² + m²c^4, right? Because for a relativistic particle, energy squared is momentum squared times c squared plus mass squared times c to the fourth.

So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p. Let's see, E² = p²c^4 + m²c^4. So p²c^4 = E² - m²c^4. Wait, but units here? GeV squared, but perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1, but I have to be careful when plugging into the velocity formula.

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in units where c is not 1. Well, let me proceed step by step.

First, compute p. Let me write E in GeV, m in GeV, but when I compute p, I have to convert to proper units. Alternatively, perhaps I can work in units where c=1, but then I'll have to remember to multiply by c at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity beta factor (v/c) using the relativistic expressions.

Wait, I remember that the velocity beta (β) is given by β = sqrt(1 - (m²c^4)/(E²)). Hmm, but E is the total energy, so that makes sense.

So let me compute β. Let's plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² is 64 (GeV)^2, m^2 is 1.44 (GeV)^2. So 1 - (m²)/(E²) = 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, which is pretty close to the speed of light.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute 1.44 /64: 1.44 divided by 64. 64 goes into 1.44, 0.0225 exactly. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as I thought.

So β ≈ 0.9887. So the velocity v is about 0.9887c. That's high, but makes sense since the energy is much larger than the mass.

Next, the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let me remember Planck's constant ħ. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, let me do that division: 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875. So 20.568e-25 s? Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. Since v is βc, so L = β c τ.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So plugging in the numbers:

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.9887 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 and 2.057e-24:

2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let's see, 3 *2=6. So 2.966 * 2.057 is about 6.112.

So 6.112 multiplied by 1e8 *1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.112e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24:

Multiply 2.966 and 2.057: 2.966 * 2 =5.932, 2.966 *0.057≈ 0.1679, so total approx 6.1, as before.

So 6.1e-16 meters. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, my approximation might be off, so perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recompute the steps with more precise numbers.

First, the calculation of beta:

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

β = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Compute m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV².

E²=8²=64 GeV².

1 - (1.44/64) = (64-1.44)/64 = 62.56/64 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= let's compute this accurately.

0.9775 = 0.9887^2? Wait, 0.9887^2: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.0087 squared is negligible. Wait, let me compute 0.9887^2:

Compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 +0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98 *0.0087 = 1.96 *0.0087 ≈0.017052.

0.0087^2 ≈0.00007569.

Adding them: 0.9604 + 0.017052 =0.977452, plus 0.00007569 is approximately 0.97752769. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887, so the beta is approximately 0.9887. So v=0.9887c.

Next, calculating the lifetime τ:

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

ħ ≈6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ= ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me calculate that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 ) *1e-25.

6.582 /0.32: 0.32 × 20.56875=6.582.

Yes, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈2.056875e-24 s.

Now, calculating L= β c τ.

c=2.9979e8 m/s. Let me use c=3e8 m/s as a rough approximation, but perhaps using the more precise 2.9979e8 for better accuracy.

So β c = 0.9887 * 2.9979e8 ≈ 2.965e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by τ: 2.965e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.965e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.965 *2.056875) *1e-16.

Compute 2.965 *2.056875:

Let me compute 2.965 * 2 =5.93, 2.965 *0.056875= 0.1687.

So total is approximately 5.93 +0.1687=6.0987.

So 6.0987e-16 meters.

Hmm, looking at the options, there's no option with around 6e-16. The options are A)5.0223e-16, C)5.0223e-15, etc.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Because 6e-16 isn't an option. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and the other constants.

Let me recompute beta more accurately. The square root of 0.9775.

Using a calculator approach: let's find sqrt(0.9775).

We know that 0.988^2 = 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

0.989^2 = (0.98 +0.009)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 ≈ 0.978121.

Wait, so 0.989^2 is about 0.978121, which is more than 0.9775. So beta is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let me compute 0.9885^2: (0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 +0.0005^2.

0.988^2 is 0.976144.

2*0.988*0.0005 = 0.000988.

0.0005^2=0.00000025.

Sum: 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132, plus 0.00000025 is 0.97713225. Still less than 0.9775.

So 0.9885^2 =0.97713225.

The difference between 0.9775 and 0.97713225 is 0.00036775.

How much more beyond 0.9885 do we need? Let x be the additional amount beyond 0.9885. So (0.9885 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding: (0.9885)^2 + 2*0.9885 x + x^2 = 0.9775.

We can ignore x² as x is small.

So 0.97713225 + 2*0.9885 x = 0.9775.

Subtract: 0.9775 -0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

So 2 * 0.9885 x ≈ 0.00036775.

x ≈ 0.00036775/(2*0.9885) ≈ 0.00036775/(1.977) ≈ approx 0.0001863.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9885 + 0.0001863 ≈0.9886863.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So beta c = 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s (using c=3e8 for approximation) = 0.988686 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, τ=6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L= beta c * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

= (2.966 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 = (2.966 *2.056875) *1e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.966 *2 =5.932.

2.966 *0.056875 = let's compute 0.056875 as 56875e-6.

2 * 0.056875 = 0.11375.

0.966 *0.056875: 0.966 *0.05 = 0.0483, 0.966 *0.006875= approx 0.0066325. Sum is 0.0549325.

So total 0.11375 + 0.0549325= 0.1686825.

So 5.932 +0.1686825 =6.0999 (approx 6.10).

So L≈6.10e-16 meters.

But none of the options are near 6e-16. The options are all about 4e-15, 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of τ?

Let me recheck. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, τ= ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.

6.582 ÷ 0.32 = approximately 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should use more precise calculations for beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using relativistic expressions differently. Let me think about another approach.

The energy E is given, which is the total energy. So, E = γ m c², and momentum p = γ m v.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the velocity from E and m.

We can write β = p c / E.

Because E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c. So, β = [sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c ] / E → sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) * c² → sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Wait, same result as before. So I think the beta calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in the calculation. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, when computing the decay length, the formula is L = v * τ, where v is in m/s and τ in seconds. So, yes, the units would be meters.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the mean lifetime correctly. Maybe I forgot to account for the decay width being in MeV.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime τ0 is ħ / Γ. But when the particle is moving with velocity v, the observed lifetime is γ τ0, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no: the mean lifetime observed is τ = γ τ0. Because the proper lifetime is τ0, and time dilation makes it τ = γ τ0.

Wait, that's a crucial point I might have missed earlier. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial approach.

So, let's reevaluate:

The mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma.

Proper lifetime τ0 = ħ / Γ.

So τ = γ τ0.

Gamma γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = E/(m c^2) in natural units, but let's compute it.

So gamma is E/(m c^2). But in our case, E and m are in GeV, but let's make sure about the units.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. In natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/(m c^2) * c^2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²).

But if we're working in units where c=1, then E = gamma m.

So gamma = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

So, gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Wait, that's a big gamma. Let me compute beta using gamma.

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So, 1/gamma² is (1.2/8)^2= (0.15)^2=0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775), which is what I had earlier. So beta≈0.9887.

Hmm, but now, considering that τ = gamma * tau_0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

- The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean proper lifetime by τ0 = ħ / Γ.

- The mean observed lifetime is τ = γ τ0, because of time dilation.

So the decay length is L = v * τ = v γ τ0.

But earlier, I used τ = τ0, which is the proper lifetime. So I think that was my mistake. I should have used τ = gamma tau_0.

So, the correct formula is L = v gamma tau_0.

Hmm, okay. So, let me recalculate:

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s, as before.

gamma is E/(m c²), but in natural units (c=1), it's E/m. So gamma=E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So tau = gamma tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, no: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 6.6667 * 2.056875 = approx 13.6667 *1e-24? Wait, no, wait: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6.6667 * 2.056875) )e-24.

Compute 6.6667 *2.056875: 6 *2.056875 =12.34125, 0.6667 *2.056875≈ 1.3709.

So total approximately 12.34125 +1.3709≈13.712, so 13.712e-24 s → 1.3712e-23 s.

Now, velocity v is beta c = 0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.3712e-23 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 1.3712e-23:

= (2.966 *1.3712) *1e8 *1e-23 = (4.065) *1e-15 meters.

Wait, 2.966 *1.3712 → let me compute that:

2 *1.3712 =2.7424

0.966 *1.3712 = approx 1.320.

So total approx 2.7424 +1.320 =4.0624.

So L≈4.0624e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So 4.06e-15 is close to option B.

Wait, but wait, why did the calculation give around 4.06e-15 m, which is option B. So the correct answer should be B?

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Compute 2.966e8 m/s * 1.3712e-23 s.

2.966e8 * 1.3712e-23 = (2.966 *1.3712) *1e-15.

2.966 * 1.3712:

Let me compute 2.966 *1.3712.

= 2 *1.3712 =2.7424

+ 0.966 *1.3712.

Compute 0.966 *1 =0.966, 0.966 *0.3712≈0.3583.

So 0.966 *1.3712 ≈0.966 +0.3583 =1.3243.

Total: 2.7424 +1.3243 =4.0667.

So approximately 4.0667e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

### Key Information and Formulas:
1. **Decay Width and Lifetime**:  
   The mean proper lifetime of the particle is given by:  
   \[
   \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   Substituting,  
   \[
   \tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The observed lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0.
   \]  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.3712 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Velocity of the Particle**:  
   The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Therefore,  
   \[
   v = \beta c = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

4. **Decay Distance**:  
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:  
   \[
   L = v \tau.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau = 1.3712 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \times 1.3712 \times 10^{-23}.
   \]  
   Compute the product:  
   \[
   L \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches most closely with **Option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

ANSWER: B
