Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember it's one of the crystal systems. Let me think. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I think interplanar distance refers to the d-spacing. Right, the formula for d-spacing in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ)), but wait, wait. Oh yeah, I think the general formula for d_hkl in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... other terms involving the angles and their cosines. Or wait, no, maybe it's 1/d² equals something else.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up things. Let me get this straight. The interplanar spacing d for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos γ)/(a²) + (2hl cos β)/(a²) + (2kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, maybe not. I'm a bit confused. Oh right, another approach: In a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral isn't cubic. It has all sides equal, but angles can be different. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are not necessarily 90 degrees.

Wait, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So how does that affect things? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but rhombohedral might complicate things. Or wait, no, perhaps the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a certain a. But the interatomic distance is between adjacent atoms. So if it's a simple structure, like a primitive rhombohedral lattice, then the
