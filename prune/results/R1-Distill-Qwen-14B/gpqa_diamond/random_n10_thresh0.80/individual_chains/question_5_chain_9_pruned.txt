Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Alright, first, I remember that the operator for the angular momentum along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector (Px, Py, Pz) with the direction vector n. So, the operator P is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, and since n lies in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of spherical coordinates or something. Oh right, any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis, and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0. Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because for θ=0, it's along z, θ=π/2 along x, etc.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P is n·(P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But n_y is zero, so it becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each of the components.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, the operator P becomes:

P = sinθ (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix.

First, compute each term:

sinθ*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ sinθ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
cosθ*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = (ħ cosθ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these two matrices together:

Top-left element: (ħ cosθ/2) * 1 + 0 = ħ cosθ/(2)
Top-right element: (ħ sinθ/2) * 1 + 0 = ħ sinθ/(2)
Bottom-left: (ħ sinθ/2)*1 + 0 = ħ sinθ/(2)
Bottom-right: (ħ cosθ/2)*(-1) + (ħ cosθ/2)*(-1) ?

Wait wait, no. Let me compute each element correctly.

Wait, no. The first matrix is [[0, 1],[1, 0]] multiplied by (ħ sinθ/2). So the top-right element is (ħ sinθ/2)*1 = ħ sinθ/(2).

The second matrix is [[1, 0],[0, -1]] multiplied by (ħ cosθ/2). So the top-left element is (ħ cosθ/2)*1 = ħ cosθ/(2), and the bottom-right is (ħ cosθ/2)*(-1) = - ħ cosθ/(2).

So adding the two matrices:

P = [ [ (ħ cosθ/2), (ħ sinθ/2) ],
       [ (ħ sinθ/2), (- ħ cosθ/2) ] ]

Wait, no. Because wait, the first matrix is sinθ*(matrix), which is [[0, sinθ*(ħ/2)], [sinθ*(ħ/2), 0]], right? Because it's multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]].

Wait, no, let me recompute:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ*[0,1;1,0] + cosθ*[1,0;0,-1] ]

So compute each element:

Top-left: sinθ*0 + cosθ*1 → cosθ
Top-right: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 → sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 → sinθ
Bottom-right: sinθ*0 + cosθ*(-1) → -cosθ

Then multiply by ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
               [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So yeah, that's the matrix for the operator P.

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Which can be written as:

( P - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0

So we need to compute the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) and find its kernel.

Let me write out the matrix:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
                        [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0,1]]

Which is (ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
               [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (cosθ - 1) * ħ/(2), sinθ * ħ/(2) ],
  [ sinθ * ħ/(2), (-cosθ -1) * ħ/(2) ] ]

To find the eigenvectors, we can write the equations for the components. Let me denote |ψ> as [a, b]^T.

So,

( [ (cosθ -1) * ħ/(2) ] ) a + ( sinθ * ħ/(2) ) b = 0
( sinθ * ħ/(2) ) a + ( (-cosθ -1) * ħ/(2) ) b = 0

We can factor out ħ/(2) from each equation, so we have:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

We can write equation 1 as:

b = [ (1 - cosθ) a ] / sinθ

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

Which is the same as equation 1.

So, the ratio of a to b is (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ).

We can write a = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] b.

But wait, I can also write this as a = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] b

Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] b
Simplify: [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] b = tan(θ/2) * b.

So a = tan(θ/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b is tan(θ/2).

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ tan(θ/2) * b, b ] = b [ tan(θ/2), 1 ]

But we can choose b=1 for simplicity, so the vector is [ tan(θ/2), 1 ].

But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should express it in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the eigenvector as [a,1], since b can be chosen as 1. Wait, no, because in equation 1, a is proportional to (1 - cosθ) and b to sinθ.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express a and b in terms of θ.

Let me consider the vector [a, b] = [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ] ?

Wait, no. Wait, let's think about the spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, which are given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓> 

and 

|-> = -i e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↑> + cos(θ/2) |↓>.

But in our case, φ is 0 because the direction is in the x-z plane. So φ=0.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since S·n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2) would be:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Wait, no, because when φ=0, the state is cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, but wait. Let me remember correctly. The eigenstates for spin in direction n are given in terms of θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the state |+> would be:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓> ]

But since φ=0 here (because n is in x-z plane, so φ=0), then |+> is cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

So the vector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but that depends on how the basis is defined. Let me think. The eigenstates are typically written as:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

|-> = [ -sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]

Hmm, I need to confirm that.

Wait, the general formula is:

|+> = [ e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) ]

But since φ=0, it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Hmm. But wait, in our earlier matrix analysis, the ratio a/b was tan(θ/2).

Which would mean a = tan(θ/2) * b.

If I set b=1, a = tan(θ/2). So the vector is [ tan(θ/2), 1 ].

But tan(theta/2) is sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the vector can be written as [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), 1 ].

Multiplying numerator and denominator by cos(theta/2), I get [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, no. Let me see: [ tan(theta/2), 1 ] = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), 1 ].

If I factor out 1/cos(theta/2), the vector becomes [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ] multiplied by (1/cos(theta/2)).

But that's a scalar multiple, so the eigenvector can be written as [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the standard eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] for the +1/2 eigenvalue. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Let me check the matrix elements again.

Wait, the operator P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the operator matrix is:

P = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
             [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Wait, wait no, earlier calculation, P was (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, let me correct this.

Wait earlier, I had:

P = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Yes, because when I added the two 2x2 matrices, the top-left was cosθ, top-right sinθ, bottom-left sinθ, bottom-right -cosθ, all multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (cosθ) ħ/2, (sinθ) ħ/2 ],
  [ (sinθ) ħ/2, (-cosθ) ħ/2 ] ]

The eigenvalue equation is (P - λ I) |ψ> =0, where λ=+ħ/2.

So substituting λ= ħ/2,

P - λ I = [ [ (cosθ) ħ/2 - ħ/2, (sinθ) ħ/2 ],
            [ (sinθ) ħ/2, (-cosθ) ħ/2 - ħ/2 ] ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b → [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → cot(theta/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

Which can be written as a = [cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2)] b.

So the vector [a, b] is [ cot(theta/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] times b.

But cot(theta/2) is [cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2)].

So if I let b= sin(theta/2), then a= cos(theta/2).

So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1, right?

Wait, because if I set b = sin(theta/2), then a= cos(theta/2).

Thus, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches the standard result I was thinking earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], but in the options, some have factors of sqrt(2/3) or sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but wait, no, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like our result.

But some options have hbar as a factor. Wait, wait, the eig
