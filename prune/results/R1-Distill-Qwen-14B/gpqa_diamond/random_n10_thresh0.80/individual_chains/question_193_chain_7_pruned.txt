Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is something like N ∝ 1/plx⁵. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are different powers of r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, r squared, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, I think it's in parsecs. So, if the distance is r parsecs, then plx ≈ 1/r. Because plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs. So, plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / r (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/r.

Wait, but the question says the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Let me write the given relationship. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Because N is proportional to 1 over plx raised to the fifth power.

But since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that here. So substituting plx = 1/r into N ∝ 1/(1/r)^5.

Let me work that out. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is equal to r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. Oh, so N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe I need to think about how N changes as r increases. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases rapidly.

But then the options are about how N changes with distance, perhaps in terms of density or something. Or maybe it's about the number per unit volume or per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think again. When the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx
