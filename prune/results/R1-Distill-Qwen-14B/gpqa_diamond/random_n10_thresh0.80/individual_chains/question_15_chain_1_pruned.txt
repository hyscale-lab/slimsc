Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I've learned a bit about this before. Let me try to think it through.

So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. But wait, both have the same masses. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting faster, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So even though the star for Planet_1 is more massive, their sizes are the same. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. But how?

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_s / a_p) * (1/(something)), but I'm a bit fuzzy. Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability (p) is approximately equal to the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbital plane as seen from Earth. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh wait, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius. Or is it the other way around
