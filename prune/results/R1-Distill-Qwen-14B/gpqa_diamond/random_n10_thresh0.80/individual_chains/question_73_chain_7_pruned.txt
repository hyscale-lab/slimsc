Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see what I can do.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Wait, relative speed in relativity is tricky because you can't just subtract the velocities like in classical mechanics. Right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, let me get the notation straight. Let's say astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of astronaut 2, what is the speed of astronaut 1? Or is it the other way around? Because relative velocity depends on the frame. Oh wait, the problem says "relative speed" but doesn't specify who's measuring whom. Hmm, maybe it's the speed of one as seen by the other. Let's assume that, because in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the reference frame, but I think the problem is asking for one of them as the frame.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut 1 is at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the stationary frame, astronaut 1 is faster than astronaut 2. So, if I'm astronaut 2, what's the speed of astronaut 1? Or vice versa.

Wait, to find the relative speed, let's clarify: when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative speed would be (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So I think that's the formula to use here.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Plugging in: numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy. The total energy is the sum of their energies. The energy for each is gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m moving at 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0
