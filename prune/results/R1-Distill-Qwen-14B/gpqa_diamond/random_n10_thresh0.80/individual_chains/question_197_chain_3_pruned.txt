Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, when R-C≡N reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it forms an amine. But wait, no, that's maybe when it's a nitrile. Alternatively, I think that reaction is more about converting nitriles to amines, like in the Stephen reduction or something else. Or wait, maybe the compound is an ester or a ketone, but the reaction with HI and red phosphorus rings another bell. Oh wait, I think that's the method to convert a nitrile to an amine—Reaction with HCl and red phosphorus, but perhaps HI is used here. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a nitrile, but I need to figure out what the structure is first.

Let me look at the data provided. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Also, a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring with substituents, maybe an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the NMR: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton (RCHO), but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, why the broadness? Or maybe it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but 10.5 is possible. Alternatively, an enol proton, but maybe less likely. Let's think more.

In the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So for example, a para-substituted benzene, where the substituent is in the para position, causing two doublets in the NMR. So maybe a benzene ring with an electron-withdrawing group, leading to deshielded protons on either side.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm. Let's think about that. The triplet at 0.9 with 3H is likely a CH2CH3 group, so that's an ethyl group attached to something. The doublet of 3H at 1.4 ppm suggests a CH(CH3) group, maybe. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to some branching. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two adjacent CH2 groups, but maybe part of a chain.

Putting this together: the aromatic group is likely para-substituted. The substituent on the benzene is connected to a chain. Let's think about the substituent being a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde or an ester. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more in line with an ester (maybe 1720-1740 cm⁻¹) or a ketone (around 1700 cm⁻¹). So maybe a ketone? Or perhaps an ester, but let's see.

Wait, the NMR has 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. If it's a carbonyl group, perhaps a benzoic acid derivative, but the 10.5 would be the -COOH proton. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad peak around 2500-3000 as well, which matches the broad peak in IR from 3400–2500. Hmm, but wait, the IR has a strong peak around 3400–2500, which could be O-H (like in a carboxylic acid) or N-H (amine), but given that the product reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is more about nitriles. Wait, maybe the starting compound is a nitrile.

Wait, if the starting compound is a nitrile, then the IR at 1720 might not fit because nitriles have a strong peak around 2200 cm⁻¹. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Or a ketone. Let's think more about the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But then why the broadness? Aldehyde protons are usually sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but phenol OHs are usually broad but in a different region. Wait, phenol OHs are around 5 ppm or so but are broad. Alternatively, an enol tautomer? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: could the compound be a benzaldehyde derivative? Like a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached. But the IR peak at
