Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are provided.

Hmm, okay. So, in terms of energy, I'm thinking about electric potential energy here. Because we're dealing with charges and their arrangement. The system is isolated, so no external fields to consider, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Since the system is isolated and the charges are identical, I should calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum it all up. But wait, wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Let me visualize this.

Point P has the 13th charge. The other 12 are each at 2m away from P. So each of the 12 is 2m from the central charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other? Hmm, maybe not, but wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps they're all on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their positions on the sphere.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy. So, perhaps the charges arrange themselves in a way that the potential energy is minimized. For a system of identical charges, the lowest potential energy configuration is when they are as far apart as possible. But wait, in this case, 12 are constrained at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 can't move closer to P, but they can arrange themselves on the sphere.

But calculating the exact potential energy between all pairs among the 12 would be complicated. Wait, no. Because each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but the distance between any two of them could be anywhere from 0 (if they're on top of each other, but that's not allowed because they're identical and would repel) up to, well, 4m if they're on opposite ends. But the exact distance depends on their positions.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Let me think about the two contributions to the potential energy here.

First, the potential energy between the 13th charge at P and each of the 12 charges at 2m away. Second, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But calculating the potential energy between all pairs of 12 charges would require knowing their mutual distances. However, maybe the problem is assuming that all those 12 charges are at the same point, which would be the case if they're all at P, but that can't be because they are constrained to stay 2m away. Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the mutual potential between the 12 charges, but that seems unlikely because each contributes a lot.

Wait, but the options given have very small numbers, like 10^-26 and 10^-27. Let me think about the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges.

The potential energy U between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

In this problem, each charge is 2e, so q = 2 * elementary charge. The elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-1
