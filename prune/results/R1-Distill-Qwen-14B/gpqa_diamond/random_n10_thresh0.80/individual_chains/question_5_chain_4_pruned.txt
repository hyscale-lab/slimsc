Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Hmm, right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by these kinds of matrices. So, for example, the Pauli matrices come into play here.

Let me jot down what each component is:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane, right? Because any direction in the x-z plane can be parametrized by the angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector would have x component sinθ and z component cosθ.

So the operator P is proportional to the dot product of the Pauli vector (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) with the direction vector n. So, the operator P would be (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, that gives P = (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z). Let me write that out in terms of the matrices.

The Pauli matrices σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, because: σ_x multiplied by sinθ gives a matrix [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and σ_z multiplied by cosθ is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

[ [ cosθ + 0, 0 + sinθ ],
  [ sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ) ] ]

Which simplifies to [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is this matrix. Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is +ħ/2.

So, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can factor out ħ/2 from both sides, so the equation simplifies to:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |v> = |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

Which gives us two equations:

1. cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2. sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1)a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract 1 and write them as:

Equation 1: a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0
Equation 2: a sinθ + b (-cosθ -1) = 0

We can set these up as a system of linear equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, we can express one equation in terms of a and substitute into the other.

Let me try to express a from equation 1.

From equation 1: a (cosθ - 1) = -b sinθ
So, a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, but cosθ -1 can be written as -(1 - cosθ), so a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ) → a = [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Alternatively, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Let's see: [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ ) = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2 )

So a = b cot(θ/2 )

So a = b * cot(θ/2 )

Now, substitute this into equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substituting a = b cot(θ/2 )

→ sinθ * b cot(θ/2 ) + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ sinθ cot(θ/2 ) + (-cosθ -1) ] = 0

Since we're looking for non-trivial solutions (b ≠ 0), the term inside must be zero.

So, sinθ cot(θ/2 ) - cosθ -1 = 0

Let me compute sinθ cot(θ/2 ). 

Cot(θ/2 ) = cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 )

So sinθ * cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 )

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )

So substituting, we have:

2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 ) * [ cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ) ) ] = 2 cos^2(θ/2 )

So the term becomes 2 cos²(θ/2 )

So the equation is:

2 cos²(θ/2 ) - cosθ -1 = 0 

Wait, but let's expand cosθ in terms of θ/2. Cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2 ) - 1. So substituting:

→ 2 cos²(θ/2 ) - (2 cos²(θ/2 ) - 1 ) -1 = 0
→ 2 cos² - 2 cos² +1 -1 = 0 → 0 =0.

Which is an identity. So this doesn't give us any new information, which makes sense because the equations are dependent.

So, the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2 ), so the eigenvector can be written as proportional to [ cot(θ/2 ), 1 ]^T. But wait, when θ is zero, this would be problematic because cot(0) is infinity. So perhaps it's better to express it in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, since a = b cot(θ/2 ), let me express a as b [ cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ) ]

So the vector is [ a, b ]^T = b [ cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ), 1 ]^T 

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize.

The squared magnitude of the vector is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ (cos²(θ/2 ) / sin²(θ/2 )) + 1 ] 

Which is |b|² [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin² ] = |b|² [ 1/sin² ] 

So the normalization requires |b|² * (1/sin² ) =1 → |b| = sinθ/2. 

So, b = sin(θ/2 ), and a = cos(θ/2 )

Wait, let's see. Because a = [ cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ) ] * b. If we take b= sin(θ/2 ), then a = cos(θ/2 )

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]^T. 

Wait, but that's for θ. Wait, wait, but earlier we had a = b cot(theta/2 ), so when b is sin(theta/2 ), a is cos
