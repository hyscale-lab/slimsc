Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again.

The question says that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m, moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Hmm, first, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the addition formula. Newtonian physics would just say something like 0.6c -0.5c =0.1c, but relativity has a different approach. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is a bit more involved.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed u' when one frame is moving at speed u relative to another is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, I might have that backwards. Let me think. If one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, from the perspective of the first, the second's speed is... Oh right, it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c² ). Because u is the speed of the second object relative to the first? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose astronaut A is moving at velocity u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v =0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of astronaut A, what is B's speed? Because A is moving at 0.6c, but B is slower, so from A's frame, B is moving at a lower speed.

So the formula for relative speed when you have two velocities u and v (both in the same direction) is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is A's speed, and v is B's speed. So plugging in, (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But wait, speed can't be negative, so we take the absolute value, so 0.1428c. That's approximately 0.14c, which I see in the options as C and D have 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait. Wait, is that correct? Because according to the formula, if you're moving at u and you want the speed of another object moving at v from your frame, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if u is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second, or the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction
