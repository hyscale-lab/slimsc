Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, this looks a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, so the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. That means the molecular weight would be double the atomic number, right? Because each proton and neutron contributes about 1 atomic mass unit.

Wait, but wait. If W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, let me think. The simplest case is H2O, but no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe something like NH3? No, that's not. Wait, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 protons and 16? Wait, maybe it's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each atom. Or wait, perhaps each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, but that might not make much sense.

Wait, maybe the gas W is CO2? Let me check: Carbon has 6 protons, and if it's a 12C isotope, 6 neutrons. Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its 16O isotope. So each molecule of CO2 would have (6+8) protons and (6+8) neutrons, so 14 each. That fits the condition. So gas W is CO2?

But wait, the problem says the gas is released when X reacts with Y. CO2 is a gas, yes. So maybe Y is a carbonate? Or maybe X is a strong base reacting with a carbonate.

Wait, the reaction also forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above freezing. What substance has a melting point around there? Oh, maybe something like NaOH? Wait, no, NaOH's melting point is higher. Wait, maybe NH4Cl? No, its melting point is higher too. Wait, 277 K is about 4Â°C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride or something else. Wait, wait, another thought: B might be a carbonate. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate salt. When heated, it decomposes into metal oxide and CO2. So when G is heated, it releases B, which is probably the oxide. What oxide has a melting point near 277 K? Hmm, not sure. Maybe B is something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y. If X is a base, Y could be an acid. The reaction might produce a salt and water, but in this case, it's producing a gas (CO2) and a precipitate (maybe a carbonate salt? Or perhaps a hydroxide? Or maybe a sulfide? Not sure yet.)

Wait, the problem says that when X reacts with Y, a gas W is released. Let me think about possible reactions. For example, perhaps X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid Y, releasing CO2 gas. So, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce NaCl, water, and CO2 gas. But in that case, the precipitate would be none, because NaCl is soluble. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is a hydroxide, and X is an acid, but that might not produce a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a strong base. Wait, but that might not produce a precipitate either. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide, and X is an acid. Then, the reaction would produce a salt and water. But that would not release CO2 unless it's a carbonate reacting with acid.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think about keto acids. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with something
