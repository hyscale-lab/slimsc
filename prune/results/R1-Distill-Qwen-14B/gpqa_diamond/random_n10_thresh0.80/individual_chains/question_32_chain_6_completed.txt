Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li, which is lithium, normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The problem is about relativistic energy. I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So first, I should find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). I recall that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy (m c²) would be 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Next, I need to calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So yeah, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma times m c². We've got gamma as 3.5714 and m c² as 5.589 GeV. Multiply them: 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute this step by step. First, 3 * 5.589 is about 16.767 GeV. Then 0.5714 * 5.589. Hmm, 0.5 times 5.589 is 2.7945. 0.0714 times 5.589 is approximately 0.0714 *5= 0.357, 0.0714*0.589≈0.042. So total about 0.357 + 0.042 = 0.399. So 0.5714 * 5.589 ≈ 2.7945 + 0.399 ≈ 3.1935 GeV.

Adding 16.767 and 3.1935 gives about 19.9605 GeV. Wait, but that's just an approximation. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 3.5714 *5.589.

Let me write it out:

3.5714 * 5.589.

Let me break it down:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.5 = 1.7857
3.5714 *0.08 = 0.285712
3.5714 *0.009 = 0.0321426

Adding those together: 17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427. Then plus 0.285712 is 19.9284. Plus 0.0321426 is about 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 19.96 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but 19.96 is close to 20 GeV. But maybe my calculation of gamma is a bit off because I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28. Wait, let me check that again. 

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28. Wait, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So perhaps more accurately, 3.5714286.

So maybe I should use more precise values for gamma and m c² to get a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check. The mass of Li-6. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6 u. But the exact value of 1 u in GeV is 931.49406 MeV/c², which is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c². So 6 * 0.931494 GeV/c² is 5.588964 GeV. Let me use that exact value.

So m c² is 5.588964 GeV.

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute (0.96)^2: that's 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571...

So exact gamma is 3.571428571.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.571428571 * 5.588964 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication.

3.571428571 *5.588964.

Let me compute:

3 * 5.588964 = 16.766892
0.571428571 *5.588964.

Wait, 0.571428571 is approximately 4/7.

But let me compute 0.571428571 * 5.588964.

Alternatively, 5.588964 * 0.571428571 ≈ ?

Let me compute 5 * 0.571428571 = 2.857142855.

0.588964 * 0.571428571.

Hmm, 0.588964 * 0.5 = 0.294482.

0.588964 * 0.071428571 ≈ 0.588964 * 1/14 ≈ approx 0.588964 /14 ≈ 0.04207.

So 0.294482 + 0.04207 ≈ 0.33655.

So total for 0.571428571 *5.588964 ≈ 2.857142855 + 0.33655 ≈ 3.193692855.

So the total E is 16.766892 + 3.193692855 = 19.960584855 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 19.9606 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower. So why isn't it matching any of the options? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Did I compute gamma correctly?

Wait, the speed is 0.96c, so gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216. 1 - that is 0.0784. sqrt of that is 0.28, so gamma is 3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute it with more precise steps.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the mass.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6 u. But perhaps I should account for the binding energy? No, wait, the rest mass is given by the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy. But in particle physics, when considering the rest mass energy, we use the exact atomic mass, which already accounts for binding energy.

Wait, but when using the approximation of m = A * m_u, where A is the number of nucleons, that's accurate enough for this problem, I think. Because the binding energy is a small fraction compared to the rest mass. So perhaps 6 * 931.5 MeV is acceptable.

Wait, but 931.5 MeV is about 0.9315 GeV. So 6 *0.9315 GeV is 5.589 GeV, which is what I used.

Wait another thing: the problem is about the energy of the collider, which would be the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, wait, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, do they mean the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, no. In colliders, the energy typically refers to the total energy per beam particle. So the total energy is gamma * m c², which includes rest mass and kinetic.

So I think I computed the right thing. So the energy is approximately 19.96 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them match exactly. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, so 19.96 isn't exactly an option. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.17 GeV higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma or the rest mass.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving relativistically, but the calculation requires using the relativistic momentum or kinetic energy. Or perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy?

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. So the energy of the ion is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, sometimes in physics, the term "energy" refers to the kinetic energy. But in the context of colliders, the beam energy usually refers to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, sometimes the energy is given as the total energy (gamma*m c²). So I'm a bit confused here. The problem states, "the energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the total energy each ion has, which includes gamma times m c².

Wait, but let me think again. If the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, the gamma is as we computed, 3.5714. So the total energy is gamma * m c², which is around 19.96 GeV.

But none of the options match this. The options are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419.

Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error in gamma.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) with more precision.

v is 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is not exactly 5.589 GeV? Let me compute it precisely.

The rest mass of Li-6 is 6 u. 1 u is 931.49406 MeV. So 6 * 931.49406 = ?

Compute 931.49406 *6:

931 *6 = 5586.

0.49406 *6 = approx 2.96436.

So total is 5586 + 2.96436 = 5588.96436 MeV.

Convert to GeV: 5.58896436 GeV.

So m c² = 5.58896436 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.58896436.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.58896436.

I can do this with a more precise method. Let me write it as:

5.58896436 * (3 + 0.57142857)

= 5.58896436 *3 + 5.58896436 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.58896436 *3 = 16.76689308.

Compute 5.58896436 *0.57142857.

Hmm. Let me compute 5.58896436 * (5/7) since 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7? Wait, no. 3/5 is 0.6, so perhaps 0.57142857 is 4/7, which is approximately 0.57142857.

Wait, 4/7 is 0.571428571... Yes! So 0.57142857 = 4/7.

So 5.58896436 *4/7 = (5.58896436 *4)/7.

5.58896436 *4 = 22.35585744.

Divide by 7: 22.35585744 /7 = 3.193694 GeV.

So the total E is 16.76689308 +3.193694 = 19.960587 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 19.9606 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options are 19.96 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let's try that.

Kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c².

So K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.58896436 = (2.57142857)*5.58896436.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.58896436.

Again, perhaps 2.57142857 is 18/7, since 18 ÷7 ≈2.57142857.

18/7 *5.58896436 = (18 *5.58896436)/7.

18 *5.58896436 = 100.6013585.

Divide by7: 100.6013585 /7 ≈ 14.3716226 GeV.

So the kinetic energy is around 14.37 GeV, but that's not any of the options either.

Wait, maybe the question is about each ion's energy, but perhaps it's considering only one of the ions or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6 but something else. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li normally has 3 protons, so with 3 neutrons it's Li-6. So I think the mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) with more precise steps.

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Hmm. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the rest mass was calculated incorrectly. Let me double-check.

Li-6 has a mass number A=6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012 u. Let me confirm that. Wait, wait, I'm making a mistake here. The mass I used earlier was 6 u, which is 6 *931.5 MeV, but that's incorrect because the actual atomic mass of a Li-6 nucleus is slightly less than 6 u due to the binding energy.

Oh! I think I made a mistake here. Because the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. So when I calculated m c² as 6 *931.5 MeV, I overestimated the rest mass. Instead, I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

So let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. From memory, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012222 u.

So the rest mass energy would be 6.012222 u * 931.49406 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6.012222 * 931.49406 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 *931.49406 = 5588.96436 MeV.

Then 0.012222 *931.49406 ≈ 11.393 MeV.

So total is approximately 5588.96436 +11.393= 5600.35736 MeV, which is 5.60035736 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.60035736 GeV.

Now, compute E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60035736.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.60035736.

Again, the exact calculation:

3 *5.60035736 =16.80107208.

0.57142857 *5.60035736.

Hmm. Let me compute 5.60035736 * 0.5 is 2.80017868.

5.60035736 *0.07142857 ≈ let's compute 5.60035736 *0.07 =0.392025015.

Plus 5.60035736 *0.00142857 ≈ approx 0.008.

Wait, 0.00142857 is roughly 1/700. So 5.60035736 * (1/700) ≈ 0.0080005.

So total for 0.07142857: 0.392025 + 0.0080005 ≈ 0.4000255.

So 5.60035736 *0.57142857 ≈ 2.80017868 + 0.4000255≈3.20020418.

So E is 16.80107208 +3.20020418 = 20.00127626 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0013 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but not too far off. Alternatively, perhaps I should do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60035736 without approximations.

Let me approach it as:

3.57142857 *5.60035736 = ?

Calculate 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.00035736.

Wait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

5.60035736 *3.57142857.

But perhaps a more precise approach is to use the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more accurate methods or even a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 5.600357 GeV, and using gamma=3.57142857, E=3.57142857 *5.600357.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.600357.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.600357 =16.801071.

0.57142857 *5.600357.

Compute 0.5 *5.600357=2.8001785.

0.07142857 *5.600357.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.600357/14 =0.4000255.

So 0.07142857 *5.600357≈0.4000255.

So the 0.57142857 *5.600357 ≈2.8001785 +0.4000255=3.200204.

So total E is 16.801071 +3.200204=20.001275 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0013 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me look it up; the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012222 u, which is correct.

So, 6.012222 u *931.49406 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.49406 = 5588.96436 MeV.

0.012222 *931.49406 = let's compute it accurately.

0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.002222 *931.49406= approx 2.0735 MeV.

So total for 0.012222: 9.3149406 +2.0735=11.38844 MeV.

So total m c² = 5588.96436 +11.38844=5600.3528 MeV=5.6003528 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6003528.

Let me compute it accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6003528.

I'll use the exact multiplication.

First, 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0003528.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 3.57142857 *5.6003528 as:

5.6003528 *3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that 3.57142857 = 24/7.

So 5.6003528 *24/7.

Compute 5.6003528 *24 = 134.4084672.

Divide by7: 134.4084672 /7 ≈19.2012096 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.20 GeV? That doesn't make sense because earlier calculation gave 20 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. 5.6003528 * 3.57142857 is more accurately 5.6003528 * (24/7).

Wait, 5.6003528 *24 = 134.4084672.

Divide by7: 134.4084672/7 = 19.2012096 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.2 GeV, which is different from the earlier 20 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because 5.6 *3.5 is 19.6, so 5.6003528 *3.57142857 should be a bit higher than 19.6.

Wait, let me compute 5.6003528 *3.57142857 more accurately.

Perhaps using the exact fractional approach.

3.57142857 is 24/7, so 5.6003528 *24 /7.

Compute 5.6003528 *24 = ?

5 *24=120.

0.6003528 *24= approx 14.4084672.

So total is 120 +14.4084672=134.4084672.

Divide by7: 134.4084672 /7= 19.2012096 GeV.

Wait, that's 19.2012 GeV, which is about 19.2 GeV.

But earlier, when I computed gamma*m c² as 3.5714 *5.6003528, I thought it was around 20 GeV. Now, according to this, it's 19.2 GeV.

This discrepancy suggests a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, wait, gamma is 3.57142857, and the mass is 5.60035 GeV, so 3.57142857 *5.60035 is indeed 20 GeV, not 19.2.

Wait, but according to the 24/7 calculation, it's 19.2 GeV. That can't be. There must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Because 5.6003528 is in GeV, and 24/7 is unitless, so 5.6003528 *24/7 = (5.6003528 *24)/7.

Wait, 5.6003528 *24= 134.4084672.

Divide by7: 134.4084672/7=19.2012096 GeV.

But according to earlier calculation, 3.57142857 *5.6003528 = approx 20 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this using a different method.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate it as:

5.6003528 *3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5.6 *3.57142857.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

Adding them: 17.85714285 +2.14285714=20.0.

But I have 5.6003528 instead of 5.6.

So 5.6003528 is 5.6 +0.0003528.

So the extra 0.0003528 *3.57142857=approx 0.001268.

So total is 20.0 +0.001268=20.001268 GeV.

Aha! So that makes sense. So the E is approximately 20.0013 GeV.

So now, the initial miscalculation when I thought it's 19.2 GeV was because I made a mistake in the approach. Now, the correct calculation is around 20.0013 GeV.

So looking back at the options:

C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 0.13 GeV higher than our calculated 20.0013 GeV.

But wait, perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly higher value, perhaps 20.13, which would match option C.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Let's see. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6003528 more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6003528:

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6= 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0003528 ≈ 0.001262.

So adding all together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0, plus 0.001262 is 20.001262 GeV.

So this is about 20.0013 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.13 GeV higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value of the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects beyond just gamma, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation requires using the exact value of the speed, like considering more decimals. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000 = 196/2500.

Wait, sqrt(196/2500) is 14/50=0.28 exactly.

So no, there's no error there.

Hmm, perhaps the given options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm computing the total energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

So K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6003528 =2.57142857 *5.6003528.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.6003528.

Again, let me compute as 2.57142857 is 18/7.

So 18/7 *5.6003528 = (18 *5.6003528)/7.

18 *5.6003528=100.8063504.

Divide by7:100.8063504/7=14.4009072 GeV.

So the kinetic energy is approximately 14.4009 GeV.

But looking at the options, none match this either.

So I'm back to the initial conclusion that the energy is about 20.00 GeV, but none of the options are exactly that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass and the mass-energy conversion.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.012222 u. 1 u is 931.49406 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.012222 *931.49406 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.49406=5588.96436 MeV.

0.012222 *931.49406= let's compute precisely.

0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.002222 *931.49406= approx 2.0735 MeV.

So total is 9.3149406 +2.0735=11.38844 MeV.

So m c²=5588.96436 +11.38844=5600.3528 MeV=5.6003528 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.6003528.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

3.57142857 *5.6003528 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 × 5.6003528.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 ×5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0003528 = approx 0.001262.

Wait, but 5.6003528 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.0003528.

So, 3.57142857 ×5.6003528 = (3.57142857 ×5) + (3.57142857 ×0.6) + (3.57142857 ×0.0003528).

Which is 17.85714285 +2.142857142 +0.001262.

Adding these together:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0.

20.0 +0.001262=20.001262 GeV.

So, E ≈20.0013 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, none match exactly. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, but earlier calculations of kinetic energy give about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given in the lab frame, and the energy is the kinetic energy per nucleon. No, I doubt it.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the collider accelerates the ions to a certain energy, but the actual energy per ion is the total energy. So if the question is asking for the total energy, then 20.00 GeV is correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and the approximation in the problem expects us to consider more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the multiplication.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6003528 using more precise steps.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0003528 =0.00126192.

So adding all:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0.

20.0 +0.00126192 =20.00126192 GeV.

Which is 20.0013 GeV.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but the calculation doesn't quite match. Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo or expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy in terms of the rest frame or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the gamma is different because v is given as a fraction of c, but the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption about the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.012222 u. 1 u is 931.49406 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.012222 *931.49406 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.49406=5588.96436 MeV.

0.012222 *931.49406 = let's compute it as:

0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.002222 *931.49406= 2.0735 MeV (approx).

So total 9.3149406 +2.0735 =11.38844 MeV.

So m c²=5588.96436 +11.38844=5600.3528 MeV=5.6003528 GeV.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach uses the relativistic energy formula, but I'm still not getting one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132 GeV. Let's compute whether 3.57142857 *5.6003528 would be approximately 20.132 GeV.

Wait, wait! Maybe I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Because let me compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) with v=0.96c. Let me compute it more accurately.

v/c =0.96.

v²/c²=0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using more precise methods.

Wait, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

The exact value of sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma=3.571428571.

Hmm.

So perhaps the given options are using a different approach, such as considering only the rest energy, but that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the energy per nucleon, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the relativistic work-energy theorem, where the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², but that still doesn't give one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as a certain fraction, but the calculation should consider the relativistic mass, which is gamma times the rest mass.

Wait, no. The total energy is gamma m c², which is what I computed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy using the rest mass in atomic mass units. Let me try that approach.

m c² =6.012222 u *c².

But 1 u c² is 931.49406 MeV.

So m c² =6.012222 *931.49406 MeV.

Which is 5.6003528 GeV, as computed earlier.

So, E =gamma *m c² =3.57142857 *5.6003528 GeV=20.0013 GeV.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV, which is 0.13 GeV higher.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, another approach: compute v =0.96c.

gamma = (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2).

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

gamma=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for gamma. Let's compute gamma using a more precise value of v.

v =0.96c.

Compute beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Hmm.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV. But according to my calculations, the energy is approximately 20.00 GeV. The discrepancy is about 0.13 GeV, which is within the precision of 1e-4, but not matching exactly.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the atomic mass. Let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6 again. According to sources, the exact mass is approximately 6.012222 u, so I think that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy using more precise gamma.

Wait, using a calculator, 3.57142857 *5.6003528 equals approximately 20.00126 GeV.

So perhaps the intended answer is 20.0013 GeV, but none of the options are exactly that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.13 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the use of the rest mass as 6 u, leading to E=3.5714 *5.589 GeV=19.96 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) if rounded up.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C, as the calculated value is 20.0013 GeV, which when rounded to four decimal places is 20.0013, so when rounded to the fourth decimal place, it's 20.0013 GeV. But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the options, and the correct answer is not listed, but given the choices, the closest is option C.

Wait, upon rechecking, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Let me consider the rest mass as 6 u, leading to E=3.5714 *5.589=19.96 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the intended calculation was to find the kinetic energy, but that gives 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick one, and the correct approach is to calculate the rest mass of the nucleus and multiply by gamma.

But that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering protons instead of the entire nucleus. No, the problem says nucleus X, which is Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is per nucleon, but that would be much lower than the options.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.00 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but given the available choices, I'll have to choose the closest one.

Wait, perhaps the intended gamma was calculated differently, perhaps using a different approach.

Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the approximation that gamma is approximately 3.57.

Then, E=3.57 *5.6003528 GeV≈ 20.0 GeV.

But again, the options don't have 20.0.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is to be done using non-relativistic methods, but that would be incorrect for v=0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum and then use the relativistic energy formula involving momentum and mass.

The relativistic energy is given by E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)².

But since v is given, I can compute p using p = gamma m v.

v=0.96c.

p= gamma m v = gamma m 0.96 c.

So p= 0.96 gamma m c.

Wait, but E=gamma m c², so E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So substituting p=0.96 gamma m c,

E² = (0.96 gamma m c *c)^2 + (m c²)^2 = (0.96 gamma m c² )^2 + (m c²)^2.

Which simplifies to E² = m² c^4 ( (0.96 gamma)^2 +1 ).

But since E=gamma m c², substituting:

(gamma m c²)^2 = m² c^4 (0.96^2 gamma² +1 ).

Divide both sides by m² c^4:

gamma² = 0.96² gamma² +1.

Rearranging:

gamma² -0.96² gamma² =1.

gamma² (1 -0.96²) )=1.

gamma² * (1 -0.9216 )=1.

gamma² *0.0784=1.

gamma² =1/0.0784=12.7551.

gamma= sqrt(12.7551)=3.5714.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

So, this approach doesn't change anything.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.00 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)21.419 GeV, but I can't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in terms of individual nucleons, but that would be 6 nucleons * (proton mass), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as 6.012222 u, but when multiplied by gamma, gives approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't include that.

I think I have to go with my calculation. The correct answer should be approximately 20.00 GeV, which isn't exactly an option. But since option C is 20.132 GeV, perhaps that's the intended choice.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m c². Let me recompute the m c² precisely.

Li-6 mass: 6.012222 u.

1 u =931.49406 MeV/c².

m c² =6.012222 *931.49406 MeV.

Calculate 6 *931.49406=5588.96436 MeV.

0.012222 *931.49406= let's compute it accurately.

0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.002222 *931.49406:

Compute 931.49406 *0.002=1.86298812 MeV.

931.49406 *0.000222= approx 0.206524 MeV.

So total for 0.002222: 1.86298812 +0.206524=2.06951212 MeV.

So m c²=5588.96436 +9.3149406 +2.06951212=5588.96436+11.38445272=5600.34881272 MeV=5.60034881272 GeV.

Now, E=3.57142857 *5.60034881272 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.60034881272.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.00034881272.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.0003=0.001071428571.

3.57142857 ×0.00004881272≈approx 0.0001746.

So total for the 0.00034881272 part: 0.001071428571 +0.0001746≈0.001246.

So adding all parts: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0, plus 0.001246 gives 20.001246 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0012 GeV.

So the correct answer is approximately 20.0012 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But this is off by about 0.13 GeV.

But perhaps the problem expects using the rest mass as 6 u, leading to E=3.5714 *5.589=19.96 GeV, which is closer to 20 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

If I compute 3.57142857 ×5.60034881272=20.001246 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer uses a more precise value of gamma, but I think gamma is correct.

I think I'm stuck. Based on calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20.00 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \( v = 0.96c \) is the speed of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus has a mass of 6.012222 atomic mass units (u). Using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.49406 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.012222 \times 931.49406 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
6 \times 931.49406 = 5588.96436 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
0.012222 \times 931.49406 = 11.38844 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
m c^2 = 5588.96436 + 11.38844 = 5600.3528 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6003528 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m c^2 = 5.6003528 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.6003528
\]

Breaking this multiplication into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285
\]

\[
3.57142857 \times 0.6 = 2.142857142
\]

\[
3.57142857 \times 0.0003528 = 0.001262
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 + 0.001262 = 20.001262 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Rounded to four decimal places, the total energy is approximately \( 20.0013 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy (\( 20.0013 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, though it is slightly higher than the computed value. None of the other options match the calculation as closely.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the closest option to the computed energy is:

**Answer: C**
