Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stumped, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The question is about figuring out the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's start by looking at each part of the reaction.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y, releasing gas W. G forms a precipitate which, when heated, releases B. Let's think about possible reactions that fit this.

Gas W has molecules with the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecular formula of W would have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, no, wait—the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So for each molecule of W, the count of neutrons equals protons.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Each molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if W is H₂O, each molecule has (2 H atoms, each with 1 proton, and O with 8 protons). So total protons in molecule: 2+8=10. Neutrons in O: 8 (since O's atomic number is 8, and common isotope is 16O, 8 neutrons). So for each H₂O molecule, total protons sum to 10, and neutrons sum to 8 + 2*(1 neutron in H). So 8 + 2*0 =8? Wait, H is 1^1H, so 0 neutrons. So H₂O would have 10 protons and 8 neutrons per molecule. Not equal. So that's not it.

But wait, maybe W is CO₂? Let's see. CO₂ has one C (6 protons) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C is usually 12C (6 neutrons), O is 16O (8 each
