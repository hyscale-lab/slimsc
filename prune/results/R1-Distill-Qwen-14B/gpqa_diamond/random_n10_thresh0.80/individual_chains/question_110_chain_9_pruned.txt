Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about identifying which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits, and I need to figure out each star's apparent magnitude to see if it meets both observatories' requirements.

First, I need to go through each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes because both instruments have different brightness thresholds. 

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 (so up to 17 mag). HIRES can observe stars brighter than V=16. So, the star's apparent V mag has to be less than or equal to 16 to be seen by HIRES. But wait, no, waitâ€”actually, the question says that for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, right, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So, ESPRESSO can handle stars up to 17 mag, meaning any star with apparent V mag <=17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, no, no. No, wait: when they say "brighter than 17 mag," that means the magnitude is less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. For example, a star at V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag up to 17. HIRES can observe up to V=16. Therefore, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16 and <=17. But since HIRES is the stricter limit, the star must have V mag <=16. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (like 15), it's within both. If a star is at 16.5, then HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can.

So, let's process each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. To find apparent magnitude, use the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So, d=10 pc, so log(1) is 0. So m=15
