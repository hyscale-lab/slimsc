Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's see. I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx. 

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars varies with plx. So if I think about the distribution of stars in the universe, they're spread out in three dimensions. I think stars are more numerous at certain distances because there are more of them as you go outward, but wait, the number density in space probably doesn't change too much. Oh, but as you go further away, each shell has more volume, so more stars but they appear fainter and closer together in the sky.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So uniform in the galaxy? Or uniformly spread in all directions, so the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. Oh right, assuming uniform distribution, then the number density is constant.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. But since we're talking about a range of parallax, which corresponds to a range of distance, perhaps in terms of plx, we need to relate how the number of stars depends on plx.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's say we have a small change in parallax, Δplx. What's the corresponding change in distance? Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by Δplx, d decreases by (Δd ≈ - (Δplx)/plx²). Or maybe it's easier to express the volume in terms of plx.

Wait, let me think. The volume between plx and plx + dplx (a small change in plx) would correspond to a certain range of distance. Let me consider plx as a variable. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

If I have a small change in plx, dplx, then the corresponding change in d is dd = -d² dplx. Because d = 1/plx
