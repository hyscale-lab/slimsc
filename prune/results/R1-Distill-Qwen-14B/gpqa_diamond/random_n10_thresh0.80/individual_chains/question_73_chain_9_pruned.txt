Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the problem says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds because of the velocity addition formulas. Wait, right, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, no, wait. Let's get that right. If the first astronaut is moving at u =0.6c and the second at v=0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So u is the velocity of the first object as seen from the second's frame. Wait, actually, let me clarify. When you have two objects moving in the same direction, each sees the other moving at a different speed. So if the first is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and the second at 0.5c, then in the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, no. The formula is for when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second object as seen by the first is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. When the lab frame has the first object at u and the second at v (both positive x), then the speed of the second as seen from the first's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the first is moving at u, and we're looking at the second moving at
