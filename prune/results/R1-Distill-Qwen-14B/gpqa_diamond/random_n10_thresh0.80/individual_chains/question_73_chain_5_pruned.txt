Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The other has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—if they're moving in the same direction, how do I find the relative speed between them? Oh, right, because relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I remember that correctly. Oh yeah, because at high speeds, you can't just subtract them; you have to account for the fact that velocities don't add linearly when approaching the speed of light.

So plugging in the values: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c². The c² cancels out, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and option D also 0.14c. So relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 0.6 minus 0.5 is 0.1, yes. Then denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5) because (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) is 0.3c²/c²=0.3. So denominator is 0.7. So 0.1c /0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c, so correct.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, the system consists of both astronauts, so I need to calculate their relativistic energies and add them. Oh right, because relativistic energy includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, I compute their individual energies and sum them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait no, wait. Wait, E = gamma * m c². Oh wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So E1 is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, let me recheck. Gamma is 1.25, mass is 2m. So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for 0.5c: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1
