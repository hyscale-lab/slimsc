Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are four points in 3D space, each with different coordinates. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this ρ must represent some kind of state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, so that's like taking the outer product of |0⟩ with itself and |1⟩ with itself, adding them together, and then halving. I think I've heard that this represents a classical mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Oh right, because each term is (|0⟩⟨0|) which is a pure state, and (|1⟩⟨1|), same thing, and they're averaged because of the 1/2 factor.

But how does this translate into the geometrical position? I'm a bit fuzzy on the Bloch sphere representation. I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where pure states are on the surface. But what about mixed states?

The density matrix for a mixed state can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere. The position depends on the coefficients of the density matrix. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ again. ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Alternatively, I can write it as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute what that is in terms of matrix elements.

The |0⟩ state is [1, 0]^T, and |1⟩ is [0,1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix. So, ρ is (I)/2, since (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is I, the identity matrix.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = I/2. Now, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting this equal to ρ, I can compare:

(I + r·σ)/2 = I/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I.

Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0.

Hmm, so r·σ is zero. The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, the vector r must satisfy r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0 matrix.

Wait, but the only way that a linear combination of the Pauli matrices equals zero is if all their coefficients are zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So, r_x = r_y = r_z = 0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, that's option C) r=(0,0,0).

Wait, but why is this the case? Because the state is a completely mixed state. The density matrix I/2 represents a maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the origin is the completely mixed state, so r is zero. So that makes sense. So the geometrical position is the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. Comparing this general form to the given density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

we see that it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) must be zero. Therefore, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0,0,0)\), corresponding to the origin in qubit space.

The maximally mixed state is represented by the origin on the Bloch sphere, confirming that the geometrical position of \(\rho\) is \((0,0,0)\).
