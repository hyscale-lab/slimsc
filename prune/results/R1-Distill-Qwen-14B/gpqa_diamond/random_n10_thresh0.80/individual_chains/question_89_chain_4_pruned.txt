Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.

The first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, to form an alkene. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons in adamantane, this should produce an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often less polar and might be solids at room temperature, especially if they're part of a rigid structure like adamantane.

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, but wait—what's happening here? If we started with a dihalide, elimination should give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait! Maybe the elimination isn't just E2. Alternatively, maybe it's an E1cb mechanism, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps, another possibility is that KOH in such conditions can cause a substitution reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—both bromines are on adjacent carbons. So the structure is probably something like Br-C-C-Br attached to the adamantane framework. So when KOH is heated, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form a double bond. But why the IR has a carbonyl peak?

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility is that KOH is causing a substitution where both bromides are replaced. Oh wait! If vicinal dihalide reacts with two equivalents of a strong base, perhaps it forms an epoxide. But wait, no, epoxide formation usually involves a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygens. Or wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but that would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in IR, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ is more like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong
