Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, writing that out, S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, that would make Ay a matrix where each element is multiplied by h/(4π). So the first row becomes [0, (-i)(h/4π)] and the second row [i*(h/4π), 0].

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to pick which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, so first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Because once I know that, I can check each option.

So, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, det(Ay - aI) = 0. But let's write down Ay first.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, the matrix elements are:

(0, [ -i * h/(4π) ] )
( [ i * h/(4π) ], 0 )

So, to find the eigenvalues, we set up the equation:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0

Which is:

| -a      (-i h/(4π)) |
| (i h/(4π))   -a  | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) )(i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (i * (-i) ) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, because (i)(-i) is -i² which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation is:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π )

Wait, but wait, I thought the eigenvalues of the spin matrices are ± ħ/2. But wait, what's the value of ħ here? Because ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Wait, but in our case, the matrix S is given as [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something? Let me think. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are usually 2x2 for spin-1/2 systems. The Y Pauli matrix is (i times something?), or wait, the standard Y Pauli matrix is (σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]). So, our S is exactly σy.

Wait, so S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by something else. Because σy is a Pauli matrix, and for a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in our problem, Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π). So let's compute c * S. Since S is σy, then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says that the
