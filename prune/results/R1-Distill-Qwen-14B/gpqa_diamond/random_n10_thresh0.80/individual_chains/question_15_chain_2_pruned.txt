Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, so the key point is transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something with the orbital distance). Or wait, I think it's actually (R_p / R_s) squared times (something else). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_s + R_p)) or something like that. Wait, no, I think the formula is more about the relative distances.

Wait, let me recall. The transit probability, P, is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a/(R_s + R_p))^2 ), but wait, no. I think that's not quite right. I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a / (R_s + R_p) )^0 ), but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p / a) squared. Or maybe it's based on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Let me think again.

Ah, right! The transit probability is given by the formula: (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a + R_s)), assuming edge-on orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2? Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s) squared times (something else). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look this up in my memory.

Oh wait, I think the transit probability is actually proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * sin i)), but since sin i is 1 for edge-on
