Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is smaller with radius r. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. So the conductor is uncharged, but then a small charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and it's also a distance l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, so I need to find E at point P.

I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, right! The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge -q because of the +q in the cavity. And since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it.

But wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge after induction should remain zero. Wait, noâ€”when you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface induces an opposite charge, and the outer surface would have the same charge as the cavity's charge because the conductor was neutral. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. The conductor is neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (which is the cavity's wall) will have -q due to induction. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero (since the conductor as a whole is neutral). Oh wait, yes, because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor was uncharged. So when you put +q inside, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, so the conductor's net is (-q + q) = 0. So overall, the conductor has no net charge.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor was neutral, so when you put a charge inside, say +q, the inner surface must have -q. Then the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have
