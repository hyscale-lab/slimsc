Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and break it down. 

The question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of it. The main point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

So, here's what I know: the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but how does that work exactly? Oh right, when spots are present, they are cooler regions on the star's surface. So the star's overall brightness might be affected, but the effective temperature is a measure that takes the average. But how does covering 40% of the surface with cooler spots affect the overall Teff? Hmm, I think the calculation involves finding the new Teff based on the fraction of the surface covered. But I'm not sure if I need to calculate that or if the problem just gives the new Teff as 5500 K, so I can use that.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. Wait, but the star's temperature is around 5500 K when spotted. Hmm. 

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference. 

Wait, but in this case, the problem gives the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength. 

So, let me calculate the energy difference. But wait, actually, when considering the ratio, the ratio itself is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So, the ratio depends on temperature. 

The ratio when there are spots is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spot)), and when there are no spots, it's (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no_spot)). 

Since the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means that when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. Because the exponential term becomes smaller as T decreases. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. 

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots. 

But wait, because without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. The factor would be the ratio when no spots divided by when spots are present.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Since the statistical weights (g2/g1) are constants, they cancel out when taking the ratio. So, the factor is exp(ΔE/(k T_no_spots)) / exp(ΔE/(k T_with_spots)) = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T_no_spots - 1/T_with_spots ] )

Alternatively, since the problem gives the wavelength λ, which is 1448 Å, I can compute the energy E = hc/λ. But wait, 1448 Å is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-8 meters. 

Let me compute ΔE. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-8) 

Calculating that: 

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 1.448e-8: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-8 = approximately 1.373e-17 J per photon.

Wait, but since E here is per photon, for each transition. But in the Boltzmann factor, I need to find ΔE/(k T). So let's compute that.

Boltzmann constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, for each temperature, compute (ΔE)/(k T). Let's compute that for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

First, compute ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-17 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = approximately 9953 K. 

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-17 / 1e-23 is 1e6. So 1.373e-17 / 1.38e-23 is roughly 1e6*(1.373/1.38) ≈ 1e6 * (0.995) ≈ 995,000 K, so about 1e6 K.

Wait, that's a huge value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-8 m) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-8 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-8 = approximately 1.373e-17 J.

Now, E = hc/λ = 1.373e-17 J.

So, E/(k) is (1.373e-17 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e6 K ≈ 0.995 * 1e6 ≈ 995,000 K.

So, E/(k) ≈ 1e6 K. 

Wait, that's about a million Kelvin. That seems really high. Because 6000 K and 5500 K are much lower than that.

Wait, but ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. So, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is ΔE/(k T). Let me compute that for both temperatures.

At T = 6000 K:

ΔE/(k T) = (1e6 K) / (6000 K) ≈ 166.67.

Similarly, at T = 5500 K:

ΔE/(k T) = 1e6 /5500 ≈ 181.82.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the exponent is that large, exp(-166) is practically zero, and exp(-181) is even smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would be extremely small, but the question states that the ratio decreases when there are spots, which would imply that with lower T, the ratio becomes smaller. Wait, but if the exponent is so large, what's the ratio?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the calculation. Because 1448 A is in the UV, which is a high energy transition. So, for stars with lower temperatures, that line may be less prominent, which would make sense. But I'm trying to find the ratio n2/n1.

Wait, let's think about the Boltzmann equation again. The ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Since E2 > E1 (because it's an absorption line, maybe?), the ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio n2/n1 even smaller. So, when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's at 6000 K (no spots). So, the ratio without spots is higher.

The factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_with_spots) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_with_spots) )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_with) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Wait, because [ ( -1/T_no ) + (1/T_with ) ] = (1/T_with - 1/T_no )

So, the factor is exp( (E/(k)) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Wait, but E/(k) is 1e6 K as I calculated earlier. So, (1e6 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Let me compute that:

1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4
1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

So, (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 ) = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Multiply by E/(k) = 1e6 K:

1e6 K * 1.513e-5 = 15.13.

So, the exponent is 15.13. So, the factor is exp(15.13). But wait, that's a huge number.

Wait, but wait, no, because I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the initial calculation of E/(k T). Let me double-check the calculation of E/(k).

Wait, E = hc/lambda. So let me compute E in J:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448 A = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m → 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, I think earlier I had 1e-17, but this is 1e-18. That changes things.

So E is 1.373e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K.

So, E/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Ah, that's a big difference. I think I had an extra order of magnitude earlier. So, that brings E/(k) down to about 1e5 K, which is manageable.

Now, let's recompute the exponent for the factor.

The factor is exp( (E/(k)) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

E/(k) is ~1e5 K.

T_with = 5500 K, T_no = 6000 K.

1/T_with = 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/T_no = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

Subtracting these: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5 K^-1

Multiply by E/(k) = 1e5 K:

1e5 * 1.513e-5 = 1.513.

So the exponent is approximately 1.513.

So the factor is exp(1.513) ≈ e^1.513. Let me compute that.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817. 1.513 is a bit higher, so perhaps around 4.53 or so.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which fits closely. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Because the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = factor.

In the problem, the ratio decreases when spots are present → so the factor is >1, which matches our calculation.

So the answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000$ K) to having spots ($T_{\text{eff}} = 5500$ K). The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to a transition wavelength of $\lambda = 1448$ Å. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{k T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{k T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $\Delta E$
The energy difference $\Delta E$ is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s is Planck's constant, $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s is the speed of light, and $\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1.448 \times 10^{-7}$ m. Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio $\Delta E / k$ is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Exponent
The factor depends on the temperature-dependent term:

\[
\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right).
\]

Substituting $T_{\text{with spots}} = 5500$ K and $T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000$ K:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (99,500) \times (1.513 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.513.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.513) \approx 4.53.
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, as expected due to the lower temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately $4.5$, which matches option C.
