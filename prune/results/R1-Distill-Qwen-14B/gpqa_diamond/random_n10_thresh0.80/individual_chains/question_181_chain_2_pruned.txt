Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, I think I should recall what the pp-III branch is.

From my notes, the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main one is the pp-I branch where two protons fuse into a deuteron, then another proton fuses to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei combine to make helium-4. But there's also the pp-II and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the production of boron-8, which is a key source of neutrinos in the sun.

Wait, but when they say the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? I think boron-8 is one of the main sources of neutrinos because when it decays, it emits neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the production of boron-8 would stop. That would mean fewer neutrinos from that source, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands.

The question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to know which band corresponds to what kind of neutrino.

I remember that the main neutrinos from the sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the pp chains and the CNO cycle. The neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy, but I think the pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact energy ranges.

Wait, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay are mono-energetic, right? They have a specific energy. But wait, boron-8's decay emits neutrinos with energies around 15-20 MeV or something like that? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Boron-8 decay produces neutrinos at around 15-20 MeV? Or is that something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, no. The Beryllium-7 captures a proton to become Boron-8, which then decays into
