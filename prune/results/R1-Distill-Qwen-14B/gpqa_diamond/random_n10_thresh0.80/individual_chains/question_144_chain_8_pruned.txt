Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. So, decay length L is approximately c multiplied by the lifetime τ, multiplied by the velocity v. So L ≈ c * τ * v. 

But wait, particles with very short lifetimes (like most mesons) decay almost immediately, so their decay length is very short. I think the formula involves the proper lifetime, which is τ_0 = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Oh, but I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, no, the uncertainty principle says Γ is the uncertainty in energy, which inversely relates to the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I need to compute the lifetime τ. But wait, the problem gives Γ_X as 320 MeV. But units are important here. Γ is in energy units, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me make sure I get the units right.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because sometimes the formula uses the total decay width
