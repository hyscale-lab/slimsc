Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so classical mechanics might not apply here.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. So I probably can't use the classical formula directly. I remember that in special relativity, energy is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, for small velocities, gamma approaches 1, so the classical expression is a good approximation, but when velocities get high, relativistic effects matter.

In harmonic oscillation, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the classical case, it's all potential at maximum displacement (x=A) and all kinetic when passing through equilibrium (x=0). But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma -1) mc².

So, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx², right? Or maybe not. Because in some cases, like the relativistic oscillator, the potential might be different. Wait, the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential is (1/2)kx² as usual.

So at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero there. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential is zero, and the kinetic is maximum. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is equal to the kinetic energy at x=0 plus the potential at x
