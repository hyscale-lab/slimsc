Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I've studied some relativity before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values for v_rel and E.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c because that would give 0.1c, but in reality, it's different. Oh right, because of the Lorentz transformation. So I need to use the formula for relative velocity.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at velocities u and v in the same direction (both in the positive x-direction here) is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, if object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of A as seen from B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Right, because you're using the velocity addition formula from the perspective of one frame to another.

So in this case, astronaut 1 has a speed of 0.6c, and astronaut 2 has 0.5c. Both are in the same direction, so the relative speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) because (0.6 *0.5)=0.3, right? So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a good start.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, I need to use the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate each astronaut's energy.

Astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.
Gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.
Gamma for 0.5c: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2=1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding these together, E_total ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². So that's about 5.96 times mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than what I calculated.

Wait, but wait a minute. Oh, wait, is the total energy just the sum of their energies in the lab frame? Because in relativity, when you have multiple objects, their total energy is the sum of their individual energies. So yes, I think that's what the problem is asking for.

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So the correct option would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Because I'm a bit confused about the direction. The calculation I did was for the relative speed of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2. Alternatively, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds adjusted by the relativistic formula, as I did.

Yes, so (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c, but divided by (1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1/0.7 = 1/7 ≈0.1428... which rounds to 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the options: option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (astronaut 1's speed) and \(v = 0.5c\) (astronaut 2's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{1}{7}c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
Mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
Mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
