Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The question gives me some details about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and their host stars. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

Hmm, the first thing I remember is that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, how exactly does that work?

I think the transit probability is given by the formula P = R_p² / (R_s²), but wait no, that's not exactly right. Oh wait, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Or is it related to the orbital distance? Oh, right, another factor is the orbital distance and the star's radius.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star) is higher when the star is larger because the planet has to cover a smaller area. Or wait, no—wait, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius divided by something else. Let me think.

I think the probability of a transit is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, it's roughly P ≈ (R
