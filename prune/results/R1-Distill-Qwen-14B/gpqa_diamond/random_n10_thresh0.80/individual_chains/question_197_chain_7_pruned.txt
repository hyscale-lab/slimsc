Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. They also provide IR and NMR data for Compound X. Hmm, okay.

First, let me think about what reaction is taking place here. Red phosphorus and HI... Oh right, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, right? Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes, but wait, isn't that the same as using LiAlH4? Or wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no: wait, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes via a metal hydride. So, if the starting material is a ketone, it'll become an alkane. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it up with another reaction. Oh, wait, Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes (like R2CO → R2CH2). Oh, but wait, wait, another possibility: I might be confusing with another reaction. Oh, perhaps I'm mixing it with the Birch reduction? No, Birch is for aromatic rings. Wait, no—Clemmensen is for ketones. So, if the starting compound is a ketone, it'll be reduced to an alkane.

Wait, but let me think again. The Clemmensen reduction uses red phosphorus and HI (concentrated HCl? No, wait, HI is used. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of reduction. Wait, wait, wait—another thought: when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), treating with red phosphorus and HI (H-I) is a known way to perform a reduction. So, for example, a ketone would reduce to an alkane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Clemmensen reaction reduces ketones to alkanes, yes. For example, acetophenone would become toluene.

But wait, wait—another possibility: the compound might have a carbonyl group that isn't a ketone. Maybe it's an ester or something else. But the IR data can help me figure that out.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm^-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm^-1—those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, combining these, the compound likely has an aromatic ring (from the 1610 and 1450 peaks) and a carbonyl group (1720 cm^-1), possibly a carboxylic acid since there's a broad O-H stretch around 3400.

Wait, but wait. The broad peak (bs) at around 10.5 ppm in the NMR is a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. So, the structure is likely a substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.

So, the NMR data: let's break it down. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably the COOH proton. It's broad and singlet because in DMSO or another solvent, the exchange broadens it.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, likely para to substituents. Since it's a doublet, maybe adjacent to substituents.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also a
