Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle and finding the normalization constant 'a'. 

Alright, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but that seems a bit odd because wave functions usually have real and imaginary parts, but I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is complex, with a real part and an imaginary part. So the function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) as the real part, and -0.5i as the imaginary part? Or is it a single complex expression? Hmm, I think it's more likely that the wave function is a complex function, so it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that would mean the entire expression is a complex number. Alternatively, maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some exponential or imaginary term. Hmm, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. But the problem says it's the wave function, so I'll proceed.

The key thing here is that the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh wait, but the problem states that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh wait no, actually, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, the wave function here is only valid in a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, but the given wave function is a function of x, so perhaps it's zero outside that interval. Or perhaps the wave function is defined only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside that region. So, when they measure, they find the particles only between 1 and 3, which implies that the wave function is zero outside this interval. Or does it?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says that each particle can move along a tube (x-axis) and the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1
