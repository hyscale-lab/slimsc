Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, and then determining which statement is correct among the given options.

First, I remember that for angular momentum operators, each component (like A_x, A_y, A_z) has its own matrix representation. The problem states that A_y is given by c times S, where c is h/(4π). So, let me write that down: A_y = c * S.

The matrix S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), and the second is (i, 0). Wait, that's the same structure as the Pauli matrices, right? Oh wait, yes, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is essentially the Pauli Y matrix.

So putting it all together, A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let's compute that.

The matrix A_y - a I is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

So the determinant is [(-a)(-a) - ( (h/(4π))*(-i) )*( (h/(4π))*i ) ] = 0.

Calculating each part:

(-a)(-a) = a².

The other term is [ (h/(4π))^2 * (-i)(i) ) ] = (h²/(16 π²)) * (-i^2) = (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) because i^2 is -1, so negative of that is 1.

So determinant = a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ] = 0.

Set that equal to zero: a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues of A_y are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, the options given in the multiple-choice don't directly match these. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and the real part is ±h/(4π). Hmm. But the eigenvalues I found are real. Because A_y is Hermitian? Wait, yes, because S is Hermitian. Because S^dagger would be the same matrix as S. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, and c is real, so A_y is Hermitian. So eigenvalues should be real. So that means any imaginary parts in the options are incorrect.

So looking at the options:

Option A has imaginary parts, so that's wrong because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B says eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1. That doesn't match our result either. We found a = h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So unless h is set to a specific value or scaled, those are the actual eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units or scaling factors. Oh wait, perhaps the eigenvalues are in units of ħ. Because I know for spin-½ particles, the spin components have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Because S is the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, but wait, in this problem, S is defined as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Let me think.

Wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix, [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. But the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is (σ_y). So S has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. Wait no, S is just the matrix; when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues scale.

Wait, wait. The operator S here is the Pauli Y matrix, which is 2x2. So its eigenvalues when acting on a spinor would be ±1 because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if A_y is (h/(4π)) * S, then the eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) * (±1).

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually represented as (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So for example, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Let me check that.

In that case, the eigenvalues of S_y would be ± ħ/2. So in our problem, A_y is c times S, where c is h/(4π). So c = (h)/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= (ħ/2) * (1/π * 2π )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me compute c:

c = h/(4π).

But in quantum mechanics, ħ = h/(2π). So h = 2 π ħ. So substituting, c = (2 π ħ)/(4 π) )= (2 π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/2.

Oh! So c is ħ/2. Because h = 2 π ħ, so yeah, h/(4 π) = (2 π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Which is exactly the standard expression for the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction for a spin-½ particle. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 * 1, because σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I computed the eigenvalues of A_y, I found a = ± h/(4 π) = ± ħ/(2). So yes, that matches. So a is ± ħ/2.

But looking back at the options, none of them mention ħ. Perhaps the problem uses h instead of ħ? Wait, the problem statement says c = h/(4 pi). So perhaps the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi), which is the same as ± ħ/2 since h = 2 pi ħ.

So the eigenvalues are real, and equal to ± h/(4 pi). So any option stating imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B can be eliminated because they have imaginary parts.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum. Since A is the angular momentum operator, A^2 would be (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) plus terms for cross products, but wait no, in quantum mechanics, the square of the vector operator A is A_x² + A_y² + A_z². So, if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, is it also an eigenfunction of A^2?

Wait, for a spin-½ particle, A^2 = (ħ/2)^2 * 3, because the total spin squared is s(s+1)ħ², here s=1/2, so (3/4) ħ².

So for any state, A² φ = (3 ħ²/4) φ.

So any eigenstate of A_y is automatically an eigenstate of A², because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for spin-½ particles.

So option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct.

But option C also says it's not an eigenfunction of Az. That's true because A_y and A_z don't commute. So if you have an eigenstate of A_y, it's not an eigenstate of A_z. So option C is correct in both parts.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would typically be the eigenvectors of the matrix, which are the eigenfunctions φ. So if the operator's matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then its eigenfunctions form the basis. So in that case, yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay. So option D would be correct.

But wait, let me think again. The statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix representation of Ay in the eigenbasis would be diagonal, with eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions
