Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, no, actually, p is in arcseconds and d in parsecs, so p = 1/d. So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the number of stars change as the parallax changes. I remember that the number density of stars in space isn't uniform when considering distance. Wait, I think there's a concept in astronomy where the number of stars you can see depends on their distribution and distance.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, but our observations are limited by distance (since more distant stars have smaller parallaxes, making them appear dimmer and harder to detect), then the number of stars we observe at a certain distance would depend on the volume of space up to that distance. 

Wait, let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell multiplied by the thickness. But since the distribution is uniform, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars at a certain distance (d) would depend on the surface area. But wait, no, because the number is per volume, so the number in a spherical shell (which has volume 4πr²Δr) is proportional to r²Δr. But how does this translate to parallax?

Since parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's express everything in terms of p. So, d goes from, say, 1 parsec (p=1") to larger distances (smaller p). 

The number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in a shell between d and d+Δd is n * 4πd² Δd. But we need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (plx) changes. So, plx is p = 1/d. So, d = 1/p. Let me express the number in terms of p.

First, let's find Δp in terms of Δd. Since p = 1/d, Δp ≈ - (1/d²) Δd. So, Δp = -(1/d²) Δd → Δd = -d² Δp. Since d = 1/p, Δd = (1/p²) Δp.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is n * 4πd² Δd. Substituting Δd as (1/p²) Δp:

n *4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p² Δp) ) 

Wait, let me compute d squared: d² = (1/p)^2 = 1/p². So substituting:

number = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) Δp )

Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let's walk through it step by step.

The number in the shell is N = n * (4π d²) * Δd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4π d² Δd, assuming Δd is small.

But since Δd is in terms of distance, and we want to express everything in terms of parallax p, which is 1/d. So, let's write the number as a function of p.

Express d in terms of p: d = 1/p.

So, d² = 1/p².

Δd = (1/p²) Δp * (-1) → but since we're considering a small increase in p, it's better to take absolute values. So, Δd = (1/p²) |Δp|.

Wait, actually, when p increases, d decreases. So, a small increase in p (Δp) corresponds to a decrease in d. So, the shell at p would have Δd = - (1/p²) Δp. But I'm getting a bit confused with the signs, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can ignore the sign, or consider that Δp is positive when p is small (since larger distances have smaller p). Hmm, maybe it's better to just express N in terms of p and Δp.

So, N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (Δd).

But Δd = Δp / (p^2), because d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp → so Δd = -(1/p²) Δp, but in terms of magnitude, it's (1/p²) |Δp|.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * ( 1/p² ) Δp )

Wait, that would be N = n * 4π (1/p^4) Δp.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax Δp is proportional to 1/p^4. So, as p increases (which is equivalent to looking at closer stars), the number per unit p increases with 1/p^4?

Wait, but wait that can't be right. Because that suggests that as p increases (meaning closer stars), the number increases more rapidly. Let me think of the distribution. When you're considering a small range of p, the number of stars in that range depends on the volume of the shell, which depends on d squared, but since d is 1/p, that's p^-2. And the thickness of the shell in p is Δp, but the volume is also related to how d changes with p, which is the (1
