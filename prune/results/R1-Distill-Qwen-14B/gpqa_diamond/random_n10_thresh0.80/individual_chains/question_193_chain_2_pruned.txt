Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Right, parallax is something related to distance. Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) equals 1 over distance (d), maybe with a constant or some multiplier, but the basic idea is plx ∝ 1/d.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. They're asking about the number per unit range of distance. So I need to find how N depends on r, the distance.

Alright, let's write down what we have. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no wait. Let me think again. If plx is 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Therefore, N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps they mean the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. Hmm. Let me think. The number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume, but how does it scale here?

Alternatively, maybe they're just asking for the dependence on r. So if N is proportional to d^5, then if you double the distance, the number of stars would go up by a factor of 32 (2^5). But that seems a lot. Wait, but no, perhaps I'm getting confused between N and the density. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the density of stars is a function of distance, so N is proportional to some function of r.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But as plx is 1
