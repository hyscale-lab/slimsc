Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. Wait, speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by n, right? So in the glass, light's speed would be c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. Oh, this might involve some relativity or just classical addition of velocities.

Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. The light's speed in the medium is c/n, but because the medium is moving, perhaps we need to consider the speed relative to the lab. Hmm.

Wait, but when the medium is moving, does the speed of light in that medium change? Or is the speed of light in the medium always c/n regardless of the medium's motion?

Wait, in classical physics, velocities add linearly. So the speed of the light relative to the lab would be the speed of light in the medium plus the speed of the medium. But wait, that's not right because light's speed isn't just additive like thatâ€”Einstein's relativity comes into play at high speeds, but maybe the problem is assuming non-relativ
