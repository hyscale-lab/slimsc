Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles can be different, but wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, so it's a special case where all the angles are the same, making it a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal system.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for calculating this distance in different crystal systems.

Wait, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But wait, this is for cubic systems. So what about rhombohedral?

Since rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal or a variant, maybe the formula is similar but with some adjustments for the angles. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = [1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos βγ + 2hl cos αγ - 2kl cos αβ ) ] * something? Wait, no, perhaps I should think about using the structure factor formula or the interplanar distance formula that involves the
