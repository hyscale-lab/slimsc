Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, some reagents are common. Wait, maybe X is something like a halogen or a metal? Or perhaps it's a strong base or acid?

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but a molecule is made of atoms, each with their own protons and neutrons. Or maybe W is an element where the atom's protons equal its neutrons? Because if it's a molecule, it's probably a diatomic gas, like O2 or N2. But I'm not sure. Let me think: the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Maybe it's H2O, but no, because that's a molecule, but the protons and neutrons are per atom. Alternatively, maybe W is CO2? No, that's a linear molecule. Wait, maybe it's a noble gas? Because noble gases are monoatomic. Like, say, Argon, which has 18 protons and 22 neutrons? No, wait, that's not equal. Wait, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think for each atom: if the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, then the isotope would have mass number 2p. So for example, chlorine-35 has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. That's not equal. Wait, maybe carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So carbon-12 has p=n=6. So the gas W could be carbon dioxide, but wait, CO2 is a molecule, but each C has 6, O has 8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe W is nitrogen gas, N2. Nitrogen has 7 protons, 7 neutrons in the most common isotope.
