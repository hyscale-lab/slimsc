Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I can't ignore relativistic effects anymore. Oh right, in relativity, the equations of motion change because of things like time dilation and mass increase due to velocity.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. Then, the kinetic energy (1/2)mv² would equal this. So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so option C can't be right. So I can probably eliminate that.

Relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light. The problem is, I'm not sure about the exact form of the equations for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Maybe I should think about the energy considerations in relativity.

In special relativity, the total energy of a particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy and kinetic energy oscillate. At maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position, all is kinetic.

So let's think about the total energy E in the relativistic case. The maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², but I'm not sure if that's correct in relativity. Wait, Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential energy is (1/2)kx², which I think still holds in the relativistic case as long as x is not so large that the approximation breaks down. So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA² plus rest mass energy? Or is it just the potential energy?

Wait, think again. In the non-relativistic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy. But when you include relativistic effects
