Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson, X. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion pairs.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the total mass of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of the boson. Also, the fermions should have a charge that allows the interaction to occur. The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks like an interaction term. Oh, right, so the boson X couples to fermions with a Yukawa-type interaction.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is proportional to X(y) times ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to. The mass is 6 GeV, so I need to check which fermions have a mass less than 6 GeV, because each decay product's mass must be less than X's.

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and each fermion in the pair must have a mass such that 2m_f < M_X. Because each fermion has mass m_f, the pair would require 2m_f < M_X. So the maximum mass for a single fermion is M_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses below 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): negligible, around 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV
- Up (u) and Down (d): up is about 2.2 MeV, down is about 4.7 MeV. So way below 3 GeV.
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (wait, no, s quark is about 95-100 MeV, but maybe I should think in terms of current masses. Wait, but in the Standard Model, the masses are from the Higgs coupling, but for the up-type quarks, their masses are higher. Let me think.)

Wait, I think the masses of the light quarks are much lower. u and d are around 2-5 MeV. s is about 100 MeV, but wait, wait, no, s quark is actually around 100 MeV, right? Or was that the c quark? No, c is much heavier. So s is 95-100 MeV, which is 0.1 GeV. So 2m_s is 0.2 GeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into s sbar.

Wait, what about the charm quark (c)? Its mass is around 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 3 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, so 3 GeV is exactly half. Wait, but is it allowed? Because if the mass is exactly half, that's the threshold for the decay. So 2m_c = 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 3 GeV is half of 6 GeV. So 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than (M_X) 6 GeV. So X can decay into c cbar.

Wait, 2m_c is 3 GeV, so 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So yes, it is allowed. So X can decay into c cbar.

What about the bottom quark (b)? Its mass is about 4.5 GeV. 2m_b would be ~9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy, but X's mass is 6 GeV, so t is way beyond.

What about the tau lepton? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is around 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

What about the muon and electron? Their masses are way below 3 GeV, so 2m_e and 2m_mu are negligible. So X can decay into mu+ mu- and e+ e-.

So possible fermion pairs for decay are:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, what about the u and d quarks? Their masses are so low that 2m_u and 2m_d are way below 6 GeV. So X can decay into u ubar and d dbar.

So the possible decay channels are:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b and s etc. But since b's mass is too high, X can't decay into b bbar. So A is wrong.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That matches what I found. So B includes all except the top and bottom.

Option C includes t quark, which is not possible. So C is out.

Option D includes b and tau, mu, e, but no c. Wait, D's decay includes b which is too heavy. So D is wrong.

Wait wait, let me recheck:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the fermion masses again. For the c quark, is its mass around 1.5 GeV? Because 2m_c would be 3 GeV, which is half of 6 GeV. So 6 GeV is enough for c cbar decay.

So yes, X can decay into c cbar.

So the correct allowed decay channels are: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Which is exactly option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f (y).
\]

This indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \) via a Yukawa-like interaction. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must be less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.

\[
X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^-.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Matches the allowed decay channels. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
