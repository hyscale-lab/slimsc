Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but relativistic effects probably change things because of the speed of light limit. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is found by converting the potential energy into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic case, so option C might not be the right answer here.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light. The relativistic kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I need to consider the total energy including relativistic effects.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² as before, but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mv²_max.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx² as long as we're using the classical form of the potential, which might not be accurate at high speeds, but perhaps the question assumes that the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement.

So setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) m c²

Because in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², so the kinetic energy at maximum speed is that.

So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Rearranging, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Wait, because 1/2 k A² is the potential energy, and that equals the kinetic energy (relativistic) at equilibrium.

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let's call it alpha for a moment. So alpha = (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Then gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + alpha.

Then, I can square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2, it's 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator is (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is small if kA²/(2 m c²) is not too big, but in any case, the equation is correct.

Taking square roots:

v/c = sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha).

Wait, but I can factor the numerator. 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me express 2 alpha + alpha² as alpha (alpha + 2). Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (1 + alpha)^2 - 1.

Wait, (1 + alpha)^2 is 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2, so subtracting 1 gives 2 alpha + alpha^2 as the numerator.

Hmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as (1 + alpha) * (2 + alpha) - something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression for v in terms of alpha and then substitute back alpha.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha).

Which can be written as c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me try substituting alpha back.

Remember alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² ).

So, substituting,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c² ) from numerator inside sqrt.

Let me denote beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ). So alpha = beta.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express this.

Wait, the numerator inside the sqrt is beta*(2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

Let me think of beta (2 + beta) = beta^2 + 2 beta.

Wait, but the denominator is (1 + beta)^2 if I square it. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator sqrt(beta (2 + beta)) as sqrt( beta^2 + 2 beta ) = sqrt( beta^2 + 2 beta + 1 -1 ) = sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 )

But that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, let me try to write the entire fraction.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [beta (2 + beta)] ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( [beta (beta + 2)] ) / (1 + beta )

Wait, perhaps I can factor beta +2 as (1 + beta ) + 1.

Not sure.

Wait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (sqrt(beta) ) * sqrt( beta + 2 ). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to multiply numerator and denominator by something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the entire fraction as a single fraction under the square root.

Wait, v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which can be written as [alpha (2 + alpha)] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, perhaps I can manipulate this expression into one of the given forms.

Let me factor (2 + alpha) as (1 + alpha) + 1.

So,

[ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

This becomes [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha)^2 + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ alpha/(1 + alpha) ) ] + [ alpha/(1 + alpha)^2 ).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as (1 + alpha)(something).

Wait, let me think about the denominator. The denominator is (1 + alpha)^2. The numerator is alpha(2 + alpha) = alpha (alpha + 2).

If I factor alpha out, it's alpha(alpha +2) = alpha (alpha + 2). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the expression.

Wait, perhaps the options can be rearranged.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, I have v²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta again.

So,

v²/c² = [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Wait, I can write this as [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as [ beta (1 + beta +1) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ beta ( (1 + beta) + 1 ) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ beta (1 + beta) + beta ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ beta (1 + beta) ]/(1+beta)^2 + beta/(1 + beta)^2.

= beta/(1 + beta) + beta/(1 + beta)^2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write v²/c² as [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = (beta (2 + beta)) / ( (1 + beta)^2 )

= [ (beta (2 + beta) ) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 2 + beta as (1 + beta) + 1, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (beta (2 + beta) ) = beta ( (1 + beta) + 1 )

= beta (1 + beta) + beta.

So,

v²/c² = [ beta(1 + beta) + beta ] / (1 + beta)^2.

= [ beta(1 + beta) ]/(1 + beta)^2 + beta/(1 + beta)^2.

= beta/(1 + beta) + [ beta/(1 + beta)^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = [ beta/(1 + beta) ) ] + [ beta/(1 + beta)^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can combine these terms.

The first term is beta/(1+beta), the second is beta/(1+beta)^2.

Let me write them over a common denominator, which is (1 + beta)^2.

So,

beta/(1+beta) = beta (1 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ beta (1 + beta ) + beta ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Wait, that's the same as [ beta (1 + beta + 1) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Wait, no, because beta (1 + beta) is beta + beta^2, plus beta gives beta + beta^2 + beta = beta^2 + 2 beta.

Which brings us back to the same expression. Hmm.

So, perhaps it's better to think of v²/c² as [ beta (beta + 2) ]/(beta +1 )^2.

Wait, let's think about the options.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2.

= (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2.

Which is exactly the same as v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = [2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2.

Wait, so that implies that v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me check.

Yes, because beta is (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So, option D is:

v_max = c*sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches our expression.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we set (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1 ) m c².

Wait, but wait, is that correct?

In the harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is (1/2)kA².

At equilibrium, all energy is kinetic.

So (1/2)kA² = relativistic KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

Yes, that's correct.

So, indeed, gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So, then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which, when I solve for v, gives the expression in option D.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me recheck.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, no, wait the denominator is (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) ), not squared. Because in the denominator, it's (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) ), then the square is only the denominator.

Wait, wait, let me recheck.

In the expression we derived, v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ), where beta is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So, v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

Looking at option D:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we start by considering the total energy of the system. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential energy, given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy, which in the relativistic case is \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the potential energy to the kinetic energy at equilibrium:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \beta)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly manipulate the terms or include factors that do not align with the relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which does not account for the speed of light constraint.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
