Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question deals with stars, their effective temperatures, and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm. I remember that when stars have dark spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, which affects the spectral lines we observe. 

The star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh right, spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average Teff decreases.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet range. 

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of -(E2 - E1)/(kT), where E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio (n2/n1) would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Since the transition wavelength is given, maybe I can find the energy difference using that.

But wait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light. So ΔE = hc/λ. Oh but wait, ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, so that's the same as the photon emitted when transitioning from level 2 to 1. Or wait, if the transition is from level 2 to 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1. So the ratio n1/n2 would be proportional to exp(ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is for the ratio. Let me write it down:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level. If the problem doesn't mention anything about g, maybe we can assume g1 = g2, so the ratio simplifies to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Or maybe the problem says that the ratio is n1/n2, but the way it's phrased is that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me read again:

"When examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, the ratio is of level 1 to level 2. So n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So when Teff is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio when no spots (higher T) is higher than when there are spots.

So the factor by which it changes would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But let's think about the temperatures. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere is 6000 K without spots, and 5500 K with spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. 

Wait, but the spots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, is the photos
