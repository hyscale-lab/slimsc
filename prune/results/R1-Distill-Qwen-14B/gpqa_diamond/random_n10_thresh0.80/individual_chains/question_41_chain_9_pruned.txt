Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right. So the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when light is moving through a medium, its speed depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in the medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any motion, the speed would be v_light = c/n. But here, the glass itself is moving, so I think I have to consider the glass's velocity as well.

But how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I'm a bit confused. I remember something about Galilean relativity where velocities add up, but that's when the medium is stationary. Wait, maybe it's about how the observer sees the light's speed relative to their own frame.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving along with it. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Wait a second, another thought:
