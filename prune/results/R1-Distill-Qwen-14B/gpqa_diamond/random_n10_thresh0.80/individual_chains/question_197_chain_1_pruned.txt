Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm^-1. The 3400-2500 region is usually where O-H or N-H stretches appear, but since no N is in the molecular formula, maybe it's an O-H stretch. Wait, but 3400-2500 is a broad region, so maybe an -OH group. But wait, another possibility is a C-H stretch for alkenes or maybe an amine, but I don't think so here.

The 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong indicator. That's probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. Because 1720 is a bit high for a ketone; usually ketones are around 1700-1750, but esters are a bit lower, like 1730-1740. Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the O-H stretch would be very broad, maybe in the IR given as 3400-2500. Hmm.

Also, looking at the 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 peaks. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1610 cm^-1 is around where the ring is less substituted, maybe ortho or para, but 1450 is more for the ring in a different substitution pattern.

Now onto the NMR. The 1H NMR data given is:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) â€“ that's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually don't show up that high unless there's an electronegative group. Wait, but 10.5 is really upfield. Wait, no, 10.5 is actually upfield for an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like a phenol -OH, but that's usually a broad peak. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe that's an aldehyde? Because an aldehyde has a C=O and an aldehyde proton.

But wait, the NMR also has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That might be an adjacent group, like a CH2 or CH next to a carbonyl. Let me think. If it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, which fits with 10.5. But wait, the integration is 1H, so perhaps an aldehyde.

But wait, looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests an aromatic ring with two sets of doublets, probably para-substituted. So like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Because each doublet has 2H, maybe each substituent is at the para positions. So the structure could be something like benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, but the integration for the aromatic protons is 2H each, so maybe it's a disubstituted benzene where each substituent is para. Wait, no, because in a para-disubstituted benzene, you would have two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that's consistent with something like two substituents opposite each other.

So putting it together: the aromatic
