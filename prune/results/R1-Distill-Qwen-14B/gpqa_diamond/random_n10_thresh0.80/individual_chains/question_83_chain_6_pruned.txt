Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point should be around pH 7, right? Wait, no, wait. Or maybe higher? Because the salt formed will be the acetate ion, which is a weak base. Oh right, so the solution at equivalence will be basic. So the pH should be above 7. Hmm.

Wait, the question is asking for two pH values: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me break this down.

First, the initial solution. They diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the concentration after dilution is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. Moles = concentration * volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles as well. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but first, let's think about the 25% titration point. So we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added. 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ + H2O), this means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, forming acetate ions. 

So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so at this point (before equivalence), it's a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.
