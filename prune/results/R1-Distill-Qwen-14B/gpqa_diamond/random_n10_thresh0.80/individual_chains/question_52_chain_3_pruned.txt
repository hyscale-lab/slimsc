Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars emit light based on their effective temperature, and dark spots would change that.

First, the star's parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why would the overall temperature decrease when spots cover part of the surface? Oh right, because dark spots are cooler regions, so when a significant portion is covered, the average Teff goes down.

The main point of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The ratio is N1/N2, where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. But wait, the problem says the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. So, without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher, and with spots (T=5500 K), it's lower. So N1/N2 is higher when T is higher, which makes sense because at higher temperatures, more excitation happens. So the denominator (N2) would be larger at higher temperatures.

Wait, with higher temperature, the exponential term exp( -ΔE/(kT) ) becomes larger because T is higher. So N2/N1 increases with higher T, meaning N1/N2 decreases. So that matches the observation.

But the problem is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

We can denote the ratio as R = N1/N2.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, let me re-express the Boltzmann equation correctly. The correct equation for the ratio of populations is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So in our case, R is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, no: because if E2 is higher than E1 (since it's an excitation), then E2 - E1 is positive. So the exponent becomes -(E2 - E1)/(k T), which is negative.

But let's not get confused. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1.

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Alternatively, since the transition corresponds to a wavelength λ, which relates to the energy via E = hc/λ.

Wait, but do I know the energy difference between the levels? No, but I can express it in terms of the temperature using the given wavelength.

Because the transition corresponds to λ = 1448 Å. Using E
