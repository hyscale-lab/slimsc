Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy needed for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6 because lithium usually has 3 protons. Oh wait, actually, the atomic number of lithium is 3, so the number of neutrons is 3, making it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

The question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we need to use relativistic equations.

I think the first step is to find the rest mass of the nucleus. The mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.008665 GeV/cÂ² each. Wait, no, that's the mass of a proton. Neutrons are slightly heavier but for simplicity, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average or maybe the mass of the nucleus can be approximated using the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Let me think. Alternatively, the mass of Li-6 can be looked up, but since the problem doesn't provide it, I'll proceed with A=6.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly A times the mass of a proton because of binding energy. Oh, but in high-energy physics, when dealing with particles accelerated to relativistic speeds, the mass used is the rest mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is calculated as the total rest mass of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But binding energy is usually much smaller than the rest mass, so maybe the approximation using A * (mass of a nucleon) is acceptable. Hmm, but I should clarify: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but actually, the exact mass might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the proton mass for each nucleon. Or maybe it's better to look for the exact mass.

Wait, I think for problems like this, the mass of the nucleus is taken as the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But without exact numbers, perhaps the standard approach is to use the mass of a nucleon times A. Or perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as m = 6 * m_proton, but that's not entirely accurate because neutrons have slightly different masses. Hmm. Alternatively, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found in terms of u (atomic mass units). Let me try to approach this.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (u). But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I might need to find the exact value. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 1
