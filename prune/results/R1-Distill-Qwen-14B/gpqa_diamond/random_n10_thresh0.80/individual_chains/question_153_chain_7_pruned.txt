Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reactants and products for three different Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts labeled A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, so I'll need to recall what that entails. The Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated.

Let's start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide in ethanol as the conditions. So, the Michael donor is the nucleophilic species, and the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. The malonate ion acts as the nucleophile. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituents are important. The (E) configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, the acrylate has a p-tolyl group on one end and a COOCH3 on the other.

In the Michael addition, the malonate's enolate (the nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is the acceptor. Since it's an E-configuration, the nucleophile will attack the less substituted site? Or does the geometry affect where the attack happens?

Wait, actually, the nucleophile adds to the beta position (the less substituted) of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha (from the donor) and beta (from the acceptor) positions.

So, when the nucleophile attacks, the acrylate will have its double bond opened. Let me think about the structure. The acrylate is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) with a COOCH3 on the other end? No, wait, wait. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with p-tolyl as the substituent on the acrylate. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOGroup. So the substituent is at position 3. So, the structure is CH2-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at position 3, which would be the double bond. So maybe
