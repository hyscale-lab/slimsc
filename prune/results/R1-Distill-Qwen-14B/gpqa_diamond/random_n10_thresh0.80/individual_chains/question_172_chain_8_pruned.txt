Okay, so I've got this astrophysics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), we need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, what do I remember about excitation in stars? Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. So if we have two levels, say E1 and E2, with E2 > E1, then the ratio n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ).

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, how does that translate? Oh, I think the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another state) would be higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars. So the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So for star_1, the ratio of the excited state to some other state is twice that of star_2.

Let me think. Let’s denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2, I think. Or wait, maybe star_1 has a higher excitation, so maybe R1 is higher than R2. Oh wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so perhaps the population in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's that the excitation for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Maybe the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as
