Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So, I'm trying to figure out what kind of surface this is. Oh, right, metrics can be in different coordinates, and sometimes they represent familiar objects.

A pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic surface, right? But wait, I'm not sure. Wait, pseudosphere is a specific kind of surface with constant negative curvature. So, the metric might represent a pseudosphere. Or maybe it's something else, like a sphere or a plane.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the pseudosphere had infinite area. Or maybe not? Let me think.

Looking at the metric: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when that denominator approaches zero, the metric blows up. That suggests that the radius of this thing is 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So the metric would be singular when x² + y² = 4. So the surface is only defined where x² + y² <4, right? Because beyond that, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which might not make sense for real coordinates.

Wait, but the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So this looks like a 2D metric. So it's a 2-dimensional surface. Now, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

So the metric is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant g would be the product of the diagonal terms, since it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - r²))², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, no, because the metric is ds² = g_xx dx² + g_yy dy², so the determinant is g_xx * g_yy = (32/(4 - r²))². So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy. But wait, sqrt(g) is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))² ) which is 32
