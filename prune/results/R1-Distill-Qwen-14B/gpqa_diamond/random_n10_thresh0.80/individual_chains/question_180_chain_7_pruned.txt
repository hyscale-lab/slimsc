Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, and their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Right, because the question is about the minimum energy of the system, which I think relates to the potential energy between the charges.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P is where the 13th charge is. So the setup is like this: one charge is fixed at P, and the other twelve are all 2 meters away from P. But wait, are the twelve charges all at the same point 2 meters away from P, or are they arranged in some other way?

Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 m from P. So perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m around P. But since the problem is about potential energy, which is a scalar quantity, the exact arrangement (like whether they're spread out or all at the same point) might not matter for the potential energy calculation, as long as their distances from the fixed charge are known.

But wait, actually, when calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, you have to consider all pairs. But in this case, I think the fixed charge is at P, and the other twelve are each 2 m away from P. So each of the twelve has a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge.

But wait, are there interactions between the twelve charges themselves? Oh right, because each of the 12 charges is also interacting with the others. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energy between each pair of the twelve and each between the fixed charge and the twelve.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the system is isolated. So all the charges are in the system. Since the fixed charge is at P, the potential energy would include interactions between that fixed charge and each of the twelve, as well as between each pair of the twelve.

But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, is there a way to arrange the twelve charges such that their mutual repulsions are minimized? Or
