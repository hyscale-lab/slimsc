Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that in particle physics, the decay products of a particle depend on its mass and the masses of the particles it can decay into.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about what this means. Oh right, the interaction term gives us information about which fermions X can interact with. So the fermion fields ψ_f are the ones that X can couple to. So X can decay into any pair of these fermions.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the term looks like a Yukawa coupling. The form is similar to the interaction between a scalar field (like the Higgs) and fermions. So the boson X is interacting with fermions of type f.

But what are the possible fermions f here? Because the exact fermions that X couples to determine what decay channels are allowed. For example, if X couples to electrons, then X can decay into e+ e-.

So the problem is asking for the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy (mass) of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if the X's mass is sufficient.

Wait, but the fermion masses vary a lot. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses. The problem is about X decaying into fermion-antifermion pairs. So, to allow decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least 2m_f.

I know the approximate masses of the known fermions:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but in reality, it's much lighter, like a few MeV)
Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
Charm qu
