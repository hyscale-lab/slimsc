Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

From what I remember, the luminosity of a star is the total energy it emits per second. I think it's related to both the star's radius and its temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law! The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, mass might not be directly relevant here unless it affects the temperature somehow. But in this problem, I don't think mass is used directly because the question is about luminosity using black body radiation, which depends on temperature and radius. So maybe the mass is a red herring or perhaps it's not needed for this particular calculation.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2. That's an important point. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the radial velocities are given. Star_1's velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! That's the Doppler effect. The star moving towards us blueshifts the light, and moving away redshifts it. 

But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of zero. So its light isn't Doppler shifted. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, if the stars are moving relative to us, wouldn't that affect the observed wavelength? But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean the observed λ_max is the same for both, or the intrinsic λ_max is the same?

Wait, the problem states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max is the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max is different from its intrinsic λ_max. Let me think.

Wien's law is about the intrinsic emission. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max would be shifted. So the observed λ_max is given by the Doppler effect. Let's say Star_2 is moving away from us (since radial velocity is positive 700 km/s). Then the observed wavelength would be longer than its actual wavelength.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Oh! So the observed λ_max for Star_1 is the same as that for Star_2. But Star_1 is stationary, so its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 is moving, so its observed λ_max would be different. Therefore, the intrinsic λ_max for Star_2 must be such that when we apply the Doppler shift, it matches Star_1's λ_max.

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max are the same. So Star_1 has λ_max_observed = λ_max_intrinsic (since radial velocity is zero). Star_2 has λ_max_observed = λ_max_intrinsic_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), because of relativistic Doppler shift. Or wait, wait, Doppler shift formula depends on whether the object is moving towards or away. Since the radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is away from us (assuming positive is away), the observed wavelength would be longer. 

But let me make sure. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Since v_r is positive (700 km/s away), the observed wavelength λ' is longer than λ.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So,

λ'_1 = λ_max1 (since v=0), and λ'_2 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ'_1 = λ'_2.

So:

λ_max1 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So λ_max1 = λ_max2 implies T1 = T2. But wait, here λ'_1 and λ'_2 are same, so λ_max1 = λ'_2 = λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

Wait, maybe I should re-express this.

Wait, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_max2 * Doppler shift factor. Let me denote the Doppler factor as D. So:

λ_max_observed_2 = λ_max2 * D.

But λ_max_observed_1 = λ_max1.

And since λ_max_observed_1 = λ_max_observed_2, we have:

λ_max1 = λ_max2 * D.

But from Wien's law: λ_max1 = b / T1, λ_max2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * D.

Simplify: T2 = T1 * D.

So T2 = T1 * D.

But D is the Doppler shift factor. Let me compute D.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Because when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So D is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

But v is 700 km/s. Let me compute that in terms of the speed of light c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v =700 km/s is 700 / (3e5) = approx 0.0023333 c.

So v/c ≈ 0.002333.

Compute (1 + v/c) = 1.002333, and (1 - v/c) = 0.997667.

So sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) )

Let me compute this.

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ (1.002333 * 1e3) / (0.997667 * 1e3) )= 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00468.

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234.

So D ≈ 1.00234.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

Wait, earlier I thought that if λ_max_observed is same, then T2 is higher than T1. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, because in the equation λ_max1 = λ_max2 * D, and λ_max is b/T, so:

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * D.

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * D.

T2 = T1 * D.

So yes, T2 is T1 multiplied by D ≈ 1.00234. So T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, but that would mean that Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. Because if D is about 1.00234, T2 = 1.00234 * T1.

So Star_2 is slightly hotter.

Wait, but earlier thought said that both have same observed λ_max, which is same as Star_1's λ_max, which is intrinsic because Star_1 is not moving. So Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is shorter than Star_1's, but due to Doppler shift, it's observed to be the same. So Star_2 is hotter.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap.

Star_1: R1=1.5 R2, V=0. So its observed λ_max is same as its intrinsic.

Star_2: R2 (smaller radius), V=700 km/s away. So its observed λ_max is longer than its intrinsic. But the observed λ_max for both is same.

So Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is shorter than Star_1's.

Which means, T2 = b / λ_max2, which is higher than T1 = b / λ_max1, since λ_max2 < λ_max1.

So T2 > T1.

Wait, earlier conclusion was T2 = T1 * D. Wait, but D is about 1.00234, so T2 is T1 * 1.00234. So that's a small increase.

But that's a minor point. Now, going back to the problem: the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2.

We can calculate L1 and L2.

Luminosity L is given by 4πR²σT⁴. So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1=1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 is T1, and T2 is T1 * D. So T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

So T2^4 is (T1^4) * (1.00234)^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1 / (1.0094) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. 2.25 * 0.0007 is 0.001575, so 2.229075 total? Wait no, wait, I think I did that wrong. Wait, 2.25 * (1 - 0.0093) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.0093) = 2.25 - 0.020925 ≈ 2.229.

But wait, wait, the exact calculation: 1.00234^4.

Let me compute 1.00234^2 first.

1.00234 * 1.00234 = approx 1 + 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2. 0.00234 squared is negligible.

So 1 + 0.00468 = 1.00468. So 1.00234^2 ≈ 1.00468.

Then, 1.00468 squared is (1.00468)^2 = approx 1 + 2*0.00468 + (0.00468)^2 ≈ 1.0094. So 1.00234^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) = 1/(1.0094) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift factor calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving away is given by:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is the same as λ' = λ * ( (1 + v/c) ) / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) )

Wait, no, wait. The relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is correct. So for v << c, we can approximate it as λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/(2c) ). But since v is 700 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, v/c is about 0.002333. So the exact value is about 1.00234 times, as I calculated earlier.

But wait, maybe I should calculate the Doppler shift more accurately. Let's compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) with v = 700 km/s.

v = 700, c = 3e5 km/s → v/c = 700/300000 ≈ 0.00233333.

So (1 + 0.00233333) = 1.00233333.

(1 - 0.00233333) = 0.99766667.

So their ratio is 1.00233333 / 0.99766667.

Compute this ratio:

1.00233333 divided by 0.99766667.

Let me compute 1.00233333 / 0.99766667.

I can approximate this as (1 + 0.00233333) / (1 - 0.00233333) ≈ (1 + x)/(1 -x ), where x=0.00233333.

Which is approximately 1 + 2x when x is small. Because (1 + x)(1 +x ) ≈ 1 + 2x.

Wait, no, (1+x)/(1-x) = [ (1+x) ] * [1/(1-x)] ≈ (1+x)(1 + x + x² + ... ) ≈ 1 + 2x + 2x² + ... for small x. So for x=0.002333, 2x is about 0.0046666.

So 1.0046666.

So sqrt(1.0046666) is approx sqrt(1.0046666) ≈ 1.002328.

So D ≈ 1.002328.

So T2 = T1 * D ≈ T1 * 1.002328.

So (T2/T1) = 1.002328.

So (T1/T2) = 1/1.002328 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Compute 0.99768^2 first: approx (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00232) + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99536 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.995365.

Then, square that: (0.995365)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004635 + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 0.99076.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99076.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Multiply by (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99076.

So 2.25 * 0.99076 ≈ 2.2287.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor, so the options are such that D is ~2.23.

But wait, why isn't the Doppler effect a bigger factor? Because 700 km/s is a small velocity compared to light speed, so the Doppler shift is minimal. Therefore, the correction to the temperature is small, so the ratio of luminosities is almost (1.5)^2 * (T1^4/(T2^4)).

Wait, but T2 is slightly higher than T1, which would make the ratio (T1/T2)^4 slightly less than 1, so L1/L2 would be a little less than 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.99076 ≈ 2.229. So about 2.23.

So the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radii Ratio
From the problem, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]
Thus:
\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]
For Star_1 (stationary), the observed wavelength is equal to its intrinsic wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,1, intrinsic}}
\]
For Star_2 (moving away at 700 km/s), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
\[
\lambda' = \lambda \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
Here, \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]
The Doppler factor is:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.00234
\]
Thus, the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2 is related to its observed wavelength by:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,2, intrinsic}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max,2, observed}}}{1.00234}
\]
Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2, observed}}
\]
This implies:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2, intrinsic}} \cdot 1.00234
\]
Using Wien's law, the temperature ratio is:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max,2, intrinsic}}}{\lambda_{\text{max,1}}} = \frac{1}{1.00234} \approx 0.99768
\]
Thus:
\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.99076
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the values into the luminosity ratio formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.99076 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Match to Options
The closest option to \(2.229\) is:
**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
