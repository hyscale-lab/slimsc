Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I remember some key concepts.

The setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so I need to figure out E at point P. Let me think about what I know about conductors and charges.

Firstly, when a conductor is neutral (uncharged) and has a cavity with a charge inside, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges inside a conductor redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor here is uncharged, so it doesn't have any net charge of its own. But there's a charge +q inside the cavity. So how does that affect things?

I think the conductor's inner surface will induce a charge. Oh right! The charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor is neutral. So the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q? Or does it? Wait, let me think.

No, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface has -q, so the outer has +q to balance, making the total zero. So the outer surface has a charge +q.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must cancel each other. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so -q (inner) +
