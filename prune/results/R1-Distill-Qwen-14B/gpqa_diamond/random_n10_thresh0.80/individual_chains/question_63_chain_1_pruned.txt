Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule's energy states and photon momentum. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest state. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are quantized. The molecule can change its state when it absorbs a photon, which must match the energy difference between the states.

The question mentions the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is initially in the lowest possible energy state. Now, it needs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That probably means the next higher energy level.

Wait, but what's the next state after the fundamental state? In molecules, the states are often combinations of vibrational and rotational energy levels. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0. The first excited vibrational state would be n=1. But also, rotational states are quantized with quantum number J.

But wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe the molecule doesn't just change its vibrational state but also its rotational state. Oh, but the question is about the fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is usually the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on the specifics). 

Wait, no, for a diatomic molecule, the rotation-vibration states are combinations of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The ground state is n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibrational state, n=1, but maybe with the lowest possible rotational state for that vibrational level.

Alternatively, it's possible that the molecule could transition via either a vibrational or rotational change. But the question is about the lowest possible energy transition, which I think refers to the smallest possible energy difference. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, perhaps it's referring to the next state in the hierarchy, which might be the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), or the next rotational state (n=0, J=1). But I'm not exactly certain which is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the
