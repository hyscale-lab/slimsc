Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the electron in certain eigenstates of a given operator and the average value of that operator. Alright, let me read the problem again carefully.

The state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, actually, it says proportional to, so maybe it's not yet normalized. I think the first thing I need to do is normalize the state. Because probabilities depend on the norm.

The operator's matrix is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j go from 1 to 2, I suppose. So A_11 is 0, A_22 is 0. A_12 is hbar/2, and A_21 is hbar/2 as well. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, that seems a bit unusual. What kind of operator has off-diagonal terms like that and zero on the diagonal? Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is similar but scaled by hbar/2. So this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Interesting.

So the operator in question is A = (hbar/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of this operator must be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, only the eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of σ_x? Oh right, they are the states along the x-axis in spin space. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be expressed in terms of |up> and |down> as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think again. The eigenstates of σ_x are spin-up and spin-down along the x-direction. The matrix representation of σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I said. So, for example, |+x> is (1,1) normalized, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), also normalized.

So the operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2 because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, multiplied by hbar/2. So the possible outcomes when measuring A are ±hbar/2.

But the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, you get an eigenvalue, not the eigenstate. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, I think the question is asking for the probability of the system being in each eigenstate of the operator A after measurement. So if the system is in |+x>, the probability would be |<+x|alpha>|^2, and similarly for |-x>.

So the first part is to find the probabilities P_+x and P_-x, given |alpha>. The second part is to find the expectation value (average value) of operator A.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared: |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1 + i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so |1+i|^2 = 2.

|2 - i| = sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5), so |2 - i|^2 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Now, we can express |alpha> as a vector in the spin basis. Let me write it as a column vector.

In the basis |up>, |down>, the vector is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Next, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me find the components of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Let me denote the coefficients as c_+x and c_-x.

So, |alpha> = c_+x |+x> + c_-x |-x>

To find c_+x, take the inner product < +x | alpha >:

c_+x = < +x | alpha >.

Similarly for c_-x = < -x | alpha >.

Compute c_+x:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ]

But <down|up> is zero, so this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (1+i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, c_-x:

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ]

<up|up> is 1, and <down|down> is 1.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) ( [1+i -2 +i ] ) / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) ( (-1 + 2i) ) / sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |c_+x|^2.

Compute |c_+x|^2:

| (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) |^2 = ( (1^2 + 1^2) ) / (2 *7) ) = (2)/(14) )= 1/7 ≈ 0.1428.

Wait, but that's the probability for |+x>. Wait, but wait, the given options don't have 1/7 as a probability. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second, let me recheck the calculation. Because the options have probabilities like 0.64, 0.36, etc., which are much larger.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Because the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, but perhaps the question is about the eigenstates of another operator, not A. Wait, the problem says: "the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So operator A is the one with matrix Aij.

Wait, but wait. The operator is given, and we need to find the probability of measuring in its eigenstates. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, as we determined. So we have to compute P_+x = |< +x | alpha > |^2 and similarly P_-x = |< -x | alpha > |^2.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, P_+x is 1/7 ≈ 0.1428, and P_-x would be |c_-x|^2. Let me compute that.

c_-x is (-1 +2i)/ (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

So |c_-x|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 *7) ) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

So the two probabilities are 1/7 ≈0.1428 and 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, the probabilities listed are such that the two add up to 1, which is correct. Let me check the options:

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. Hmm, 0.28 is 7/25=0.28, 0.72=18/25. Doesn't add to 1. Wait, no, 0.28 +0.72=1.

Wait, no, 0.28 +0.72=1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I should find the decomposition of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability of measuring each eigenvalue of A, which would be the same as the probabilities of the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but let me think again. The operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, so when you measure, you'll get either +hbar/2 or -hbar/2, and the probabilities would be |c_+x|^2 and |c_-x|^2, respectively.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, |c_+x|^2 is 1/7, and |c_-x|^2 is 5/14. Let's compute the sum: 1/7 is about 0.1428, 5/14 is about 0.3571. Adding them gives 0.5, which can't be right because probabilities should sum to 1. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, no, wait. What's 1/7 +5/14?

1/7 is 2/14, 5/14 is 5/14. So 2/14 +5/14=7/14=1/2. Oh, that's a problem. It should sum to 1. So I must have made a mistake in computing the coefficients.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product for c_+x.

Wait, let's recompute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Wait, but < down | up > is zero. And < up | up > is 1, < down | down > is 1.

So this becomes [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 + (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Which simplifies to [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the way I multiplied the terms: actually, the correct expansion is:

[ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 ] from the up terms.

Wait, no, let me recompute it properly.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ].

<up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), because |alpha> has (1+i)|up> as the first component.

<down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So putting it together:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] 

= (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify the numerator:

1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So c_+x = 3/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Therefore, |c_+x|^2 = (9)/(2*7) )= 9/14 ≈0.6429.

Wait, that's a different result! Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, where did I go wrong before? Oh, I think I messed up the inner product calculation. Let me see. I think I forgot that when you apply < +x | alpha >, you're taking the inner product, which is summing the products of the components.

Wait, no—I think I see the mistake now. In my initial calculation, I thought that <down|up> is zero, but in the inner product, I have to multiply the components correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

c_+x = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) )

Which is (3)/(sqrt(14)) )

So |c_+x|^2 = 9/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, c_-x is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) 

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(7)

= ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

So |c_-x|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 * 7) ) = (1 +4) /14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, now the sum is 9/14 +5/14 =14/14 =1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 (around 0.64) and 5/14≈0.3571 (around 0.36).

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Wait, that fits the probabilities.

But let me check the average value.

The average value (expectation value) of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli matrix, and its expectation value is <sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> using the formula.

Alternatively, since the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

The expectation value of sigma_x for a state |psi> can be found as:

< sigma_x > = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + (a b^* + a^* b )

Wait, no, let me think again. The expectation value of σ_x is given by <sigma_x> = <up| + <down| multiplied by σ_x matrix acting on |alpha>.

Alternatively, another way: the expectation value is ( <alpha| σ_x |alpha> ).

But σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when acting on the state |alpha> = [a, b]^T, σ_x |alpha> = [b, a]^T.

So <sigma_x> = a^* b + b^* a.

Because <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a^* b + b^* a.

Wait, let's compute that.

Given |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a^* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) / (7) = [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] /7.

Calculating numerator:

2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i + (-1) = 1 -3i.

Similarly, b^* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Multiply:

2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7, b^* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding them together:

(1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but wait: the probabilities I calculated were 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36, respectively.

So the correct option would be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) basis are:

\[
c_{+x} = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_{-x} = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P_{+x} = |c_{+x}|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P_{-x} = |c_{-x}|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The expectation value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = a^* b + b^* a,
\]

where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Substituting:

\[
a^* = \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad b^* = \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}},
\]
\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad b^* a = \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7}.
\]

Adding these:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1-3i}{7} + \frac{1+3i}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, the probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
