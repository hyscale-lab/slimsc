Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure here? I remember that stability constants, β, are for the formation of complexes. For a metal ion, say Co, the complexes form stepwise. So the first complex would be CoSCN^+, the second Co(SCN)_2^{2+}, and so on.

So the complexes are:
- Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ (β1 =9)
- CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂^(2+) (β2=40)
- Co(SCN)₂^(2+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₃^(3+) (β3=63)
- Co(SCN)₃^(3+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₄^(4+) (β4=16)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think. Each SCN- is -1. So Co^2+ plus one SCN would be CoSCN^+, charge +1. Two SCN would be Co(SCN)₂^2+? No, wait, no. Wait, Co^2+ is +2. Adding one SCN^- (−1) gives CoSCN^+ (charge +2 + (−1) = +1). Then adding another SCN^- would give Co(SCN)₂^(2+): +2 + 2*(-1) = 0? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I messed the charge calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, Co^2+ is +2. When it binds one SCN^-, the complex is CoSCN^+ which would be +2 + (-1) = +1 charge. Then adding another SCN^- makes Co(SCN)₂^(2+): that would be +2 + 2*(-1) = 0. Wait, that can't be correct because if you add two SCN^-, you'd have 2*(-1) = -2. So +2 (Co) plus -2 → 0. So the complex is neutral. Hmm. But I might be getting the charges wrong. Maybe the complexes are all positively charged, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are as follows:

Wait, maybe each β is for the overall complex. So for β1, it's [CoSCN]/( [Co][SCN] ), and β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]/( [CoSCN][SCN] ), etc. So the overall formation constants are cumulative. So the total β for each complex is the product of β1 through βn. So the overall β for each step is the product up to that step.

Wait, but I think the problem is that the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as the stepwise formation constants. So for the first complex, β1 = 9, so the complex CoSCN^+ has a formation constant of 9. Then β2 is 40, which would be the formation of the next complex from the previous one.

So to find the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n, you multiply the β's up to that n. So for CoSCN^+, it's β1=9. For Co(SCN)₂^2+, it's β1*β2=9*40=360. For Co(SCN)₃^3+, it's 9*40*63= let's see, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. And for the fourth complex, it's 22680*16=362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges again. Oh well, perhaps the charge isn't super important for this problem, as we're dealing with concentrations and stability constants.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, what's the blue one? I think that Co(SCN)₃^2+ is blue. Wait, I might be mixing up the colors. Alternatively, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)6]^4−? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says dithiocyanato, which would mean two SCN ligands. Wait, no—dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups. So maybe the complex with two SCN^- ligands is the dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but wait: the options for the percentage are about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So perhaps I need to find the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) complex, and then compare it to the total cobalt species.

Wait, but the question specifies 'dithiocyanato' which is di as in two SCN. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But I'm not sure about the charge, but perhaps that's not important for the calculation.

So, all right, the task is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^something in the solution.

To find the distribution of the various complexes, I'll probably need to use the stability constants and the given concentrations to calculate the fraction of each complex.

So the approach would be to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (from n=0 to n=4, perhaps) and then sum them up to find the percentage for the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

Alternatively, perhaps n goes from 0 to 4, but in reality, the higher complexes might not form much because the stability constants might not be that high. But I'll proceed.

The general approach for such problems is to assume that the concentrations of each species are proportional to their respective stability constants, adjusted by their formation paths.

Wait, but each complex is formed stepwise, so the fraction of each complex depends on the product of the β's up to that step, and the concentrations of SCN^- and Co^2+.

Wait, more accurately, the fraction of a complex with n SCN ligands is given by (β1β2...βn) * [SCN]^n / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... + [product up to β4][SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because each step builds on the previous. So the fraction of each species is determined by the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be calculated using the following formula:

For each complex, the fraction f_n is equal to (β1β2...βn) [SCN]^n / K, where K is the sum of all possible species' terms (from n=0 to n=4).

Wait, let me think again. The fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co]total), where [Co]total is the sum of all species, including uncomplexed Co^2+.

Wait, but the exact expression is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Because the denominator is the sum of all possible terms, each representing the product of the stepwise β's up to that n.

Wait, but each term in the denominator is the product of β's up to n multiplied by [SCN]^n, except for n=0, which is 1. Because for n=0, it's just Co^2+ (uncomplexed), so its term is 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that the β's are given as stepwise formation constants. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process.

So for each complex, the formation constant K_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for n=1, K1=β1=9.

n=2, K2=β1β2=9*40=360.

n=3, K3=9*40*63=22680.

n=4, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have made a mistake here. Because the stepwise β's are for each subsequent ligand. So the overall formation for Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be the product of β1 and β2.

Yes. So K1=β1=9, K2=β1*β2=360, K3=9*40*63=22680, K4=22680*16=362880.

Now, the concentration of each complex is proportional to (K_n) * [SCN]^n. Because, for each complex, the concentration [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co]^0 [SCN]^n / (denominator), where denominator is the sum over all possible n (including zero) of (K_n [SCN]^n).

Wait, but wait, the initial concentration of Co^2+ is given as 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but the question states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co)=1e-2 M. So [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3+] + [Co(SCN)_4^4+] = 1e-2 M.

So the denominator in the fraction would be:

denominator = 1 + [SCN]*K1 + [SCN]^2*K2 + [SCN]^3*K3 + [SCN]^4*K4.

Wait, no, because K1 is for n=1, K2 for n=2, etc. So more accurately:

denominator = 1 + (β1 [SCN]) + (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4)

Which is the same as sum_{n=0}^4 [β1β2...βn} [SCN]^n, with [β1β2...β0} being 1 (n=0).

So, the fraction f_n for each n is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / denominator.

So the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, is (K2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

So I need to compute:

f_2 = (K2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4
