Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected both, but the shifts in their spectral lines are different. Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star, right? So the velocity of the star (V) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh, and the formula for the velocity is something like V = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )^(1/... wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Alternatively, I think the formula that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period and other factors. Oh yeah! The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/ something) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )... No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M_star + M_p)), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star). But how does that connect to the RV method?

In the RV method, the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by K = (v) which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (2π)^(1/3) P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ (G M_p) / ( (2π)^(1/3) M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me write that again to make sure:

K = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)^(1/3) )

But since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have the same mass, M_p and M_star are the same for both. Also, assuming sin i is the same (like both are edge-on, which is the best case, so that's probably what's assumed here). So the K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, if K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (something) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (same something) / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me rearrange that. So K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3). Therefore, K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, which is larger? Wait, the question says that the shift for planet #1 is 5, and planet #2 is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So the ratio K1/K2 = 5/7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait, let me think again. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter period. So if K2 is larger than K1, that means P2 is smaller than P1? Because K = 1/(P^(1/3)), so higher K implies lower P.

Wait no, wait, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So K1=5, K2=7. So P1 is proportional to (1/5)^3, P2 proportional to (1/7)^3. So P1 is larger than P2? Because 1/5 is bigger than 1/7, so (1/5)^3 is bigger than (1/7)^3.

But the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P2 = longer than P1 by a factor?

Wait, let's calculate it.

From K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but in our case, K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that can't be right. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then higher K would mean smaller P.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the ratio of the velocities and then find the ratio of the periods.

We have K = (G M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both, and assuming sin i is same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We have K1=5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

Wait, that would mean P2 is ~ 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Oh wait, wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that would mean it's shorter, not longer. So that would make Planet #2's period shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Oh wait, maybe I inverted the ratio.

Wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P2 is longer, then the factor is greater than 1. If it's shorter, the factor is less than 1, but the question is asking how many times longer, so if it's shorter, that would be 0.36 times as long, so not longer.

Wait, but according to the calculation P2 is 0.36 P1. So it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, so the factor is 0.36.

But the
