Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. But I think the actual value might not be necessary for choosing the correct equation.

So, the Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Since the energy difference here is E = 1.38e-23 J, but maybe the exact value is a red herring because the options don't have numbers.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state would be 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2? Or wait, no. Let me re-read the question: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, maybe the excitation is higher, meaning the population in the upper level is higher. So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2, and for star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = 1. Because if star_1 has twice as excited, perhaps it's twice the population in a particular excited level compared to the other star.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is the same in each, but I think I need to model it properly. Let me think again. Let's denote the ratio as (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

For star 1: ratio1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited)
For star 2: ratio2 = 1 (since it's half as excited as star_1)

Wait no, perhaps the second ratio is 1 because perhaps star_2's ratio is lower. Alternatively, wait, perhaps the excitation is lower. Let me clarify: if star_1 has twice as excited (twice the population in the excited level), then for star_1, (n_upper / n_lower) = 2/(n_lower), but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ). So for star_1, this ratio is higher than for star_2. Because higher T would lead to higher excitation (more population in higher energy levels). So for star_1, let's say the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. So ratio1 = 2, ratio2 = 1.

So, let me write that down:

ratio1 = exp( -ΔE / (k*T1) ) = 2
ratio2
