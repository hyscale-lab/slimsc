Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's see.

First, let's parse the given information. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So, the compound has a molecular weight of (12*8)+(1*9)+(14)+(16)= 96 +9 +14 +16= 135 g/mol. Not sure if that helps immediately.

The NMR data is given as:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what these signals might represent. The triplet at 9.72 is quite upfield. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 9.72 ppm is actually downfield, like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So the triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton.

Wait, but why a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring hydrogens. Unless the aldehyde is part of some conjugated system or maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with some coupling. Hmm, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? That could cause coupling with adjacent protons.

Looking at the other signals:

6.98 and 6.51 ppm are both doublets, each integrating to 2H. These might be aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a bit upfield for aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted phenyl rings. Wait, but para-substituted rings typically show as two doublets that are close in chemical shift. Since these are both doublets and each 2H, perhaps two para-substituted aromatic rings. Or maybe one ring where two protons are adjacent to substituents. Let me think.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps exchange or some kind of diol or maybe an enol proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene with some hydrogen exchange? Not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That chemical shift is around where CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen might be. Like an OCH2 group or a CH2 near an electron-withdrawing group.

So putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, two phenyl rings, and an OCH2 group. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diarylketone? But then the aldehyde would be different. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde attached to something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl: That's typically used for diazotization. So this is likely a Sandmeyer reaction or some kind of nitrosation step. But wait, nitrosation is used for making diazonium salts, right? Diazonium salts can then undergo various reactions, like substitution, coupling, etc.

2. H2O: Maybe hydrolysis? Or perhaps a workup step after diazotization.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: That sounds like a hydrolysis condition, possibly for elimination or some kind of aldol reaction. Or maybe it's a base-induced elimination, leading to a conjugated system.

Wait, so let's think about the initial structure. The NMR suggests an aldehyde (9.72 ppm triplet), two aromatic rings, perhaps with substituents, and another group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, perhaps
