Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a speed and an energy.

Wait, first, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do v1 - v2. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So, which formula is that again? I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me check that. Yeah, that's right. So for the relative speed when objects are moving in the same direction, it's (v1 - v2) divided by that denominator.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So, v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Wait, but wait, who's moving faster? Oh, A is moving faster than B, so from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that denominator first.

0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. And c² over c² is 1, so 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So dividing 0.1c by 0.7 gives approximately 0.142857c, which is around 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that already narrows it down to C and D.

Now for the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each object. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate gamma for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c:

v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * mass * c². His mass is 2m, so 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m) moving at 0.5c:

v = 0.5c, so v²/c² = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Energy is gamma * 3m * c². So 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c². Wait, let me calculate that again. 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.4642.

So total energy is 2.5 m c² + 3.4642 m c². Adding those together: 2.5 + 3.4642 equals about 5.9642 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at options C and D: option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So putting it together, relative speed is 0.14c and energy is ~5.96 mc², which is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. 

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
