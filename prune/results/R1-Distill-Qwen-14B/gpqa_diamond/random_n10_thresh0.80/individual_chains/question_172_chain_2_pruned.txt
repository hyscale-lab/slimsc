Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me see. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann equation.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. But wait, I think the exact energy might not be needed here because the problem seems to be about the ratio of excitation levels.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in an excited state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, for each star, the excitation level is the ratio of excited to ground state atoms. Let me denote the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So for star 1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1, and for star 2, it's n2_2 / n1_2.

According to the problem, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). So, the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. So,

n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

So, for star 1: (n2_1/n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_2/n1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2), substituting the expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(exp(...)) is just the exponent.

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation.

Bring the terms involving T to one side. Let's move the terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me double-check that algebra.

Wait, starting from:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rearrangement. Let me do it step by step.

Left side: -ΔE/(k T1)
Right side: ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me bring all terms to the left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm. Let's factor out ΔE/(k):

[1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but the problem gives the energy difference ΔE, but in the options, the equation relates T1 and T2. I don't think the specific value of ΔE is needed for the form of the equation, since it's a given constant.

Wait, but the question is about the correct equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. So we can rearrange the equation.

From the above:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Divide both sides by ΔE/(k):

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE

But the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is Boltzmann's constant? Oh wait, k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me see: k = 1.380649e-23 J/K exactly. Oh, so ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = k * something?

Wait, because ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE = k * T? Let me think. Wait, no, ΔE is an energy, k has units J/K. So, ΔE/(k) has units K. So, let me compute ΔE/(k).

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

Ah! So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So,

1 K [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / 1 K

Wait, but K is the unit of temperature, so it
