Okay, so I'm trying to solve this metric problem. The question gives me a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only in dx and dy. So this must be a 2-dimensional spacetime, probably in conformal coordinates because the metric is conformally flat—only scalar multiples of the flat metric.

The question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in higher dimensions, or perhaps in a different context. Oh, right, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. But wait, in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere could also refer to a 2-dimensional manifold with a specific metric, possibly like the Schwarzschild solution but in 2D.

Wait, no. The Schwarzschild metric in 2D would be similar to the metric given. Let me think. The Schwarzschild solution in 2D has a metric like ds² = -(1 - 2M/r) dt² + (1 - 2M/r)^{-1} dr². But this is different because the given metric is in terms of x and y, not r and t. Or maybe it's conformally flat.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric describing a spacetime with a singularity, considering the denominator 4 - x² - y². If x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, causing the metric components to blow up. That suggests a singularity at the circle x² + y² =4, which in 2D could be like a black hole event horizon.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. So a pseudosphere in GR is something like the event horizon of a black hole, right? For a Schwarzschild black hole, the event horizon is at r=2M. So if the radius r here is 2, that would imply M=1, perhaps.

But wait, the Schwarzschild metric in 2D (which is sometimes called the Schwarzschild solution in 2+1 dimensions, but wait, no, Schwarzschild is 3+1. Oh, perhaps this is a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric in conformal coordinates, and we can relate it to the area of a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is written in terms of x and y, but maybe we can perform a coordinate transformation to polar coordinates. Let me try that.

Let’s switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes 4 - r².

The metric ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, so in polar coordinates, the line element becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Now, this looks a bit like a metric for a 2-dimensional spacetime with a potential, but perhaps for a sphere.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere—so I need to compute the area. The area in general would be an integral over the surface. But perhaps the metric coefficient itself can tell us something about the area.

Wait, the area element in 2D is usually given by sqrt(g) dθ dφ, but in this case, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a 2D surface, the area element would be the determinant of the metric times dθ dφ. Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ, but wait, perhaps I should think of it as the volume element in 2D.

Wait, more accurately, the area element in 2D polar coordinates is dr * r dθ. But here, the metric is ds² = A dr² + B r² dθ², where A is 32/(4 - r²). So the determinant of the metric is (A)(B) - (off-diagonal terms, which are zero). So for the area element, it's sqrt(det g) dr dθ. But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so det g is (A)*(B) = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)] * r² ?

Wait, no: wait, the metric is diagonal with components g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²) and g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] r². So the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, but that's the determinant. The area element would then be sqrt(det g) dr dθ, but wait, in 2D, the area is an integral over the surface, so you integrate dA = sqrt(g) dr dθ. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2}) dr dθ. Since g_{rθ} is zero, it's sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ.

So sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = sqrt( (32^2 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ) = 32 r / (4 - r^2).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

But wait, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? Hmm, perhaps it's the area of the event horizon at r=2. But wait, in Schwarzschild, the event horizon is at r=2M. So if r=2, M=1. The area of the event horizon is 4π M². So if M=1, area is 4π. But is that applicable here?

Wait, but maybe that's a red herring. Let me think about the metric again. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Now, let me check if this is a solution to the Einstein equations. Hmm, perhaps not necessary, but maybe the area can be computed directly.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps r=2 is the location of the singularity or the event horizon. Let's see what happens when r approaches 2 from below.

As r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric components blow up. So r=2 is a coordinate singularity, perhaps indicating a horizon or a point where the geometry becomes singular.

Wait, but if r=2 is a singularity, then what is the area around that? Alternatively, maybe the area is calculated at a specific r, like the area enclosed within r=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a sphere in this metric. Wait, a sphere in 2D is a circle. Wait, but the pseudosphere is a different concept—it's a surface of constant negative curvature, which doesn't have a finite area, I think. Alternatively, in some contexts, the event horizon is a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area in this metric for a specific radius. Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated for the entire space, but that might not make sense because the metric is only defined up to r < 2, as at r=2, the denominator is zero.

Wait, but the options are given. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C)4π(x² − y²)
D) +infty

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But these options don't have numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere is a surface that has infinite area. Because if it's a hyperbolic surface (constant negative curvature), then the area over a certain range is infinite. Or perhaps, the area of the event horizon in some metric is finite.

Wait, but in the Schwarzschild case, the area of the event horizon is 4π r_s², where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Here, if the radius is 2, then the area would be 4π*(1)^2=4π. But that doesn't match the options, because the options have 4π multiplied by expressions involving x and y, but the radius is given as r=2, which is a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the standard Schwarzschild area, but about the area within the coordinate system we have. Let me think about integrating the area element.

Wait, the area element I have is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. To find the area, perhaps I need to integrate this over some range of r. But the pseudosphere of radius r=2—maybe it's a sphere at r=2. So perhaps the area is the integral from θ=0 to 2π of the area element at r=2. But wait, if r=2 is the point of the singularity, it's a single point, so the area would be zero. But that would make option A correct.

Wait, but the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. If r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes infinite. So perhaps the area is infinite. So option D would be correct.

But wait, in the Schwarzschild case, the area at r=2M is 4π M², a finite value. Hmm, but in that case, the metric is different because Schwarzschild has g_{rr} = (1 - 2M/r), whereas here it's 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, perhaps I should do a coordinate transformation to relate this to the Schwarzschild metric. Let's see. Let me consider r = 2R, just to see if that helps. Then, 4 - r² =4 - (4 R²) =4(1 - R²). So the denominator becomes 4(1 - R²), so the metric becomes [32/(4(1 - R²))] (d(2R)^2 + (2R)^2 dθ^2) = [8/(1 - R²)] (4 R² dR² +4 R² dθ²) ?

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a 2D spacetime, but the pseudosphere area might be analogous to the event horizon area.

Wait, another approach: The metric given is similar to the metric of a 2D anti-de Sitter space or something with a negative curvature. Let me think about the form.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric of a sphere with a certain radius. Wait, the area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) with radius R is 2π R. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is conformally flat, so we can write it as e^{2φ} (dx^2 + dy^2), where φ is some function. Comparing, 32/(4 - x² - y²) = e^{2φ}. So φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), where r²=x² + y².

But perhaps the area computation is easier in this conformal form. The area element in conformal coordinates is e^{2φ} dx dy. So the area is the integral over the region where the metric is defined of e^{2φ} dx dy. But the metric is defined where 4 - r² >0 → r² <4 → r<2. So the region is the disk of radius 2.

So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of e^{2φ} r dr dθ.

But φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), so e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²).

So the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area is ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me make substitution u=4 - r^2. Then du = -2r dr → - (du/2) =r dr.

So ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = 32 ∫ ( - (du/2) ) / u = -16 ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes:

At r approaching 2 from below: u approaches 0 from above. So ln(u) approaches -infty. The integral would then be (-16 ln 0 ) → +infty. But wait, the lower limit is r=0: u=4.

So the integral [from 0 to 2] is (-16 ln u) from u=4 to u=0. So it's (-16 [ ln 0 - ln 4 ] ) → (-16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ]) → which is (-16 * (-infty)) → +infty.

So the area integral becomes:

Area = ∫θ=0 to 2π [ ∫r=0 to 2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr ] dθ

Which is (2π) * [ integral from 0 to 2 of 32 r/(4 - r²) dr ]

But we just found that integral is divergent (infinite). So the area would be infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere (in this case, perhaps the entire space up to r=2) is infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but another thought: In the case of a black hole, the area of the event horizon is finite. But in this metric, perhaps the area up to r=2 is being considered, but the integral diverges because as r approaches 2, the integrand becomes infinite. So the area would be infinite.

So looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric, and the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests a singularity at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), or equivalently \(r = 2\) in polar coordinates (\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\)). The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Structure**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \(ds^2 = e^{2\phi} (dx^2 + dy^2)\), where \(\phi = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)\). This form simplifies calculations involving the area element.

2. **Area Element**: In conformal coordinates, the area element is \(e^{2\phi} dx \, dy\). Substituting \(e^{2\phi} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\), the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]
   Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

3. **Integration for Area**: To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we integrate \(dA\) over the region \(0 \leq r < 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\):
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Divergence of the Integral**: The integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\) diverges as \(r \to 2\). Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int \frac{du}{u}.
   \]
   As \(u \to 0\) (corresponding to \(r \to 2\)), \(\ln|u|\) approaches \(-\infty\), leading to an infinite result. Thus, the total area is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect. The area is not zero because the metric covers a non-degenerate region.
- **Option B (\(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\))**: Incorrect. This expression does not represent the area in the given metric.
- **Option C (\(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\))**: Incorrect. This expression is also not related to the area.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\), leading to an infinite result.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite. 

Answer: D
