Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r?

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Wait, so if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting d into that might help. Let me write that out. So since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So plx^5 would be (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, if N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx=1/d gives N proportional to d^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. Hmm, perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars with distance. Like, how many more stars you find when you go a little further out. So maybe it's about the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of differential distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be proportional to the surface area times the volume element. Wait, no, wait, in this case, I think the problem is considering a specific region of the sky, so it's probably about the volume in that direction. Because parallax relates to distance, and the number of stars depends on how many are in that direction as you go further.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. Wait, no, because earlier I substituted and found N proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (like, delta d) would be something else. Because for a thin shell, the number of stars would depend on the surface area and the volume. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. The parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so high parallax means closer, but in this case, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases with d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So per unit distance, how does it change? That might involve taking the derivative of N with respect to d.

So if N = k *
