Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star, its brightness changes periodically as it rotates, similar to how an exoplanet passing in front would cause a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: If the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation (amplitude) in the light curve?

Hmm, so I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The options are A to D.

I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works by measuring the dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star. The depth of the dip depends on the ratio of their areas. The formula for the depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because area is proportional to radius squared.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the problem is about how the spots affect the observed brightness and how a planet's transit would compare.

The star's brightness is affected by the spots. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us (as the star rotates), the brightness would be lower. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light.

So let's break it down. The star's total brightness without spots would be its normal luminosity. When spots are present, part of the star's surface is dimmer. The problem mentions a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere is covered, that's 2πR². The spots take up 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spotted area is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction spotted on one hemisphere is 0.2, but considering the entire star, it's 0.2/2 = 0.1, or 10% of the total surface area? Hmm, maybe not. Because each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So if one hemisphere's 20% is spotted, then the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 10% of the star's total surface (since 4πR² * 0.1 = 0.4πR²).

But let me think again. The star's surface area is 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR². If a hemisphere has 20% coverage, that's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4π R². So the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

But wait, because the star is rotating, and only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variation due to spots would be a periodic dip as the spots rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere. But the effect on the overall brightness would be a change when the spots are on the side we see, but the star's brightness without spots would be higher when the spots are not visible.

Wait, no. When the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, making the star dimmer. When the other hemisphere is facing, spots are hidden, so the star
