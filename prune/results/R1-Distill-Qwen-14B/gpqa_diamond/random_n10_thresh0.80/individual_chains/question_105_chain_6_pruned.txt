Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to our Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, when we observe it over time, the brightness changes periodically as the star rotates—this is called rotational modulation. The interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the brightness variations. Now, the question is, if the star wasn't spotted, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same brightness variation amplitude in the light curve?

The options are A to D, with various values.

Hmm. Let's think about photometric variations due to spots and due to a planet transiting the star. The key here is to find the relative radius of the planet (Rpl) compared to the star (Rstar) so that the dip in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but in the case of spots, the brightness variation is not a simple dip like a planet. Spots cause a change because as the star rotates, the spotted area comes into view. Since spots are cooler, when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. So the star's brightness fluctuates as the spots rotate into and out of view.

In the problem, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, wait, filling factor is the area covered, right? So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is spots. So each spot covers 0.2 * (π R^2)/2? Wait, no. The total area of one hemisphere is 2π R²? Or wait, the area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So the spots cover 0.2 of that, so 0.4π R²? Or wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered. So 0.2 of the hemisphere's area is spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R² per hemisphere? Or wait, maybe it's 0.2 per hemisphere, so total area would be 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R². Hmm, not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

But the star's brightness variation is due to spots being in view. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of the observer's view. The brightness change depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation (spots) could closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So when the star is observed, the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to what a planet would cause. The question is, to produce the same amplitude, what planet radius is needed.

I think I need to compute the relative change in brightness (the
