Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait. So first, I think I should normalize the state |alpha> because the coefficients are given as proportional, not normalized. So I need to find the normalization constant.

The state is given as |alpha> = C [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where C is the normalization constant. So the normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Let me compute the inner product. The state is a two-component spinor, right? So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) divided by C squared.

Wait, wait. Wait, the inner product would be the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So for a state a|up> + b|down>, the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. And |b|^2 is (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + (i)(-i) etc. Let's compute that. (2)(2) is 4, (2)(i) is 2i, (-i)(2) is -2i, (-i)(i) is -i² which is +1. So 4 +1 =5, and the cross terms are 2i -2i = 0. So |b|^2 is 5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant C is 1/sqrt(7), because C squared times 7 is 1. So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Okay, now about the operator whose matrix is A with Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because i and j are row and column indices. So A12 = A21 = ħ/2, and diagonal elements A11 and A22 are zero. So that's a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements ħ/2 and zero on the diagonal.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, operators are usually Hermitian, right? Because their eigenvalues are real. So let me think if this operator is Hermitian. The matrix elements are real, so the matrix is symmetric, so yes, it's Hermitian. So the operator is Hermitian, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

So the next part is to find the eigenstates of operator A. Because the question is about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. The probability of each eigenstate would be the square of the amplitude of each component in that basis.

So I think I need to find the eigenstates of A. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The matrix for A is:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

The determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now for the eigenvectors. Let's start with λ = ħ/2.

The equation (A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]

So the equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1). But wait, considering the condition, the components are (1,1) and (1,-1) for the other eigenvalue.

Wait no: for λ = ħ/2, the matrix is:

[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]

So the first row: (-ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, a), so |+> = (1,1) normalized.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix is:

[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

So the equation is (ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2)v2 =0 → v1 +v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1).

We need to normalize these. The first eigenvector (1,1) has magnitude sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2), so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, the second eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of A are |u> = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>, and |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Wait, perhaps another way: the eigenstates are the symmetric and antisymmetric states.

So to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we can compute |<u|alpha>|^2 and |<v|alpha>|^2.

Compute <u|alpha>:

<u|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2))*(1-i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2))*(2 +i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, wait. Wait, |u> is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)), so <u| is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, for |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b= (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So <u|alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) * a + (1/sqrt(2)) * b.

Similarly, <v|alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) * a + ( -1/sqrt(2)) * b.

So let's compute them.

First, compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute <u|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) (a + b).

So let's compute a + b:

(1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) → (3) / sqrt(7).

So <u|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3/sqrt(7)) = 3/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) )= 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the magnitude squared is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute <v|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) (a - b).

a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (1+i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7).

So <v|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, and 9/14 is about 0.6428.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14. So that matches. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So 0.64 is the closest, and 0.36 is 5/14 which is about 0.357.

So the probabilities for the two eigenstates are about 0.64 and 0.36 respectively.

Now, the average value of the operator A. Since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the state |alpha> is expressed in the eigenbasis of A as |alpha> = c_u |u> + c_v |v>, where c_u is 3/sqrt(14) and c_v is sqrt(5/14) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the average value <A> is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Because A is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9/14 -5/14 ) * ħ/2 ].

So 4/14 is 2/7. So (2/7) * ħ/2 = (
