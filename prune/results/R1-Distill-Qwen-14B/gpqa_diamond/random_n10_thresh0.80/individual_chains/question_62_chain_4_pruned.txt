Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see what the target molecule is and what reagents I need to use.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). But the substituents on that carbonyl are interesting. The part before the carbonyl is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring connected to a carbonyl (CHO), and that same carbon (the one attached to the carbonyl) has a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group attached.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the position is 1, so the carbonyl is on the cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a group that's a cyclohexyl attached to a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which is attached to the cyclohexane's position 1. And that same substituent has a carbonyl group as well? Or wait, the substituent itself is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, and the position 1 is where the substituent is attached, but the rest of the molecule is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. So the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent which is a methyl group (-CH2-) connected to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group (-Cyclohexyl). Also, that same carbon (the methyl group) is attached to a carbonyl group, making it an aldehyde (CHO). So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO? No, wait. Because the substituent is the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, and the aldehyde is on the main cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a methyl group attached at position 1. That methyl group is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and the main ring also has a carbonyl group, perhaps at position 1 as well. Wait, maybe the aldehyde is directly attached to the cyclohexane at position 1. So the substituent is
