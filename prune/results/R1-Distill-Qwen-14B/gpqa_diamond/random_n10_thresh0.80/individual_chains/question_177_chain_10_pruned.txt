Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. They measured the radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're told to assume the stars are black bodies and find out by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says both stars have the same wavelength of maximum brightness. I remember from Wien's law that lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, Wien's law is lambda_max * T = constant, right? So if lambda_max is same for both, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the radial velocities are given—700 km/s for Star_2, zero for Star_1. Oh, right, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength because of the Doppler effect. So when you observe a star moving towards or away from us, the wavelength shifts. So the observed wavelength (the one where the star appears brightest) would be different from the rest wavelength. But in the problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is the same.

Wait, but the rest wavelengths would depend on their actual temperatures. So the observed lambda_max is the same because of the Doppler shift. Hmm, that complicates things. So the actual temperatures might be different, but the observed maximum wavelengths are same because of the velocity shift.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.
