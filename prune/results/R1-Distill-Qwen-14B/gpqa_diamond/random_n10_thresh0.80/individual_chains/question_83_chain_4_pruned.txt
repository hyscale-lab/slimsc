Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should neutralize each other.

First, let me try to understand the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the pH at the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by NaOH, right? So the reaction would produce sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt from a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic. So the pH at equivalence should be higher than 7.

But let me not get ahead of myself. Let's calculate each step properly.

Okay, first, let's figure out the moles of acetic acid initially. The volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration of acetic acid is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, because when you dilute, the concentration decreases. Oh right, because we added 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of solution, so total 40 cm³.

Then, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about what happens during the titration. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So, for the 25% titration point, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, moles of acetic acid in solution after dilution is 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach 25% is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But I don't think I need that volume for the pH calculation;
