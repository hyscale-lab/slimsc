Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, so I'll need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll look at the IR data given. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which I remember usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an N-H stretch (amines), but the broadness might suggest O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. I think that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Possible options are ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would show a very broad peak around 2500-3500, which fits the first IR region. Hmm, but sometimes the carbonyl in carboxylic acids is around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 might be a bit higher, maybe an ester or a ketone? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl?

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a region typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes deshielded. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would have a COOH group. Let me note that.

Then there's a 8.0 ppm doublet integrating for 2H. That looks like aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. The next peak is at 7.2 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's two substituents, the coupling would be between equivalent protons, leading to a doublet. Like in a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents.

The rest of the NMR: 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H). These seem like signals from an alkyl chain. Let me think: 0.9 triplet is likely a CH2CH3 group (like ethyl), with the triplet from the CH2 next to the CH. The 1.4 doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3), because the -CH(CH3) would split into a doublet when next to a CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to something else, maybe the aromatic ring. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH connected to another CH2, perhaps as part of a longer chain.

Putting this together, it seems like the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents. The aromatic signals suggest a para substitution. So maybe a substituent on the benzene ring that has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid, and an ethyl or iso-butyl group attached.

Wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which suggests a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which is the 10.5 ppm peak. So maybe the structure is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR again: the 10.5 ppm peak is broad and only 1H, which fits
