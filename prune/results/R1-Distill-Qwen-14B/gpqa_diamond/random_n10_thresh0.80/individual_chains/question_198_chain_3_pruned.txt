Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{n+}, but I'm not sure about the charge. Cobalt is Co(II), so each SCN- is -1. So two SCN- would be -2. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, I think. Wait, Co(II) is +2, two SCN- gives +2 -2 = 0. So neutral. That would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But wait, what about the other complexes?

Stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. For each step, right? So β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^{+}, because Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^{+} with β1=9. Then β2 is for the next step, adding another SCN-: [Co(SCN)]^{+} + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2], with β2=40. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the stability constants are for each successive addition. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 the second, etc.

Wait, wait, the general formula for the stability constant is for the nth complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} would have a stability constant βn. So for n=1, [Co(SCN)]^{+}, β1=9. For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2], β2=40. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^{-}, β3=63. And for n=
