Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. Oh wait, the refractive index n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to its speed in the medium. So normally, speed in the medium is c/n, but wait, the speed of light in a medium is actually c divided by n, right? So if c is 1 as given, then the speed in the glass would be 1/n normally.

But here's the twist: the glass itself is moving. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. So the observer is in the laboratory frame, and the glass is moving. I think I need to apply some sort of velocity addition here. Like, from the lab frame, how fast is the light moving?

Wait, velocity addition in relativity... Oh wait, but this might be a non-relativistic problem because the speed v might not be close to c. The question doesn't specify that it's relativistic, so maybe I can use Galilean transformations instead of special relativity. But I'm a bit confused because light's speed is always c in a vacuum according to relativity, but here it's in a medium.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So let's think: in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n (since in the glass, speed is c/n). But from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_light + v? Wait no, that can't be right because light's speed can't just add like that. Oh, wait, but the medium itself is moving, so this might affect the observed speed.

Hold on, I remember something about the Doppler effect for light, but that's more about frequency and wavelength changes. Or maybe the refractive index changes when the medium is moving? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the speed of the light relative to the lab frame is just c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that doesn't seem right because the glass is moving towards the observer. Maybe the observer would see the light moving faster because the medium is moving towards them.

Wait, another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, light's speed is c/n. So in the lab frame, according to Galilean addition, the speed would be v_light + v. So that would be (1/n) + v. But wait, is that correct?

But wait, wait a second. The speed of light in a medium isn't simply additive like that in Galilean transformations because light is involved. Oh wait, no, because when the medium is moving, the speed of light within that medium as seen from another frame would indeed change by the motion of the medium. So if in the medium's frame the light is moving at v_light, then in the lab frame (which sees the medium moving at v), the light's speed would be v_light + v.

But wait, if the medium is moving towards the observer, then the light is emitted (or propagates) in the same direction as the medium's motion. So adding the velocities would make sense in the Gal
