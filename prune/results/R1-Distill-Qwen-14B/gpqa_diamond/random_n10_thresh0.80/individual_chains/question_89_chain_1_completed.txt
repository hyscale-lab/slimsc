Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. From what I remember, when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. The reaction is E2, I think, where the base abstracts a proton anti to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C would likely eliminate HBr twice, forming an alkene. The product after elimination would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I believe, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is probably a structure where the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the product is called 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a conjugated diene in the adamantane framework.

The 1H NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm. Let's think about what that might represent. The 4.79 ppm peak is probably a triplet, but the question doesn't specify. Wait, the first part said that the product is a light yellow solid. KOH elimination usually gives alkenes, which are often more substituted and less strained, so maybe the product has a double bond. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Oh, that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial reaction.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Alternatively, could it be dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, dehydrohalogenation would form a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, but how? Unless the base is causing some kind of oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the base is not enough for elimination, but I thought KOH is a strong base.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is used in such conditions, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but with two bromines adjacent, substitution would lead to maybe a vicinal diol, but that's if it's an SN2, but that would require more specific conditions, and KOH is a base, not a nucleophile like water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the product. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl (C=O). So the product likely has a ketone group. So maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an epoxide? No, epoxides form from dihalides with bases, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, and a carbonyl is formed. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Wait, pinacol is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But here, it's a dihalide. Wait, no, perhaps it's a similar situation. Wait, when you have a dihalide, and eliminate two equivalents of HX, you form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require a structure where the two adjacent carbons each have a leaving group and maybe an H. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent carbons in the structure.

If we eliminate two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, would that form a carbonyl group? Wait, elimination of two HBr's from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. But that would be an alkene, not a carbonyl. Unless... wait, perhaps the base is causing an elimination followed by some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that the base abstracts a proton, leading to a conjugate base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. Wait, maybe it's a two-step substitution. But KOH is more of a base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution where two OH groups are added, but that would form a diol, not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR. The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests some kind of group that's deshielded, like an oxygen-bearing CH2. Maybe a hydroxyl group adjacent to CH2, but in NMR, OH groups are usually broad and might not appear at 4.79. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group's CH2 or an ether's CH2. Alternatively, an epoxide would have protons around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a different environment.

Wait, another thought: if the initial product is a ketone, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a ring. The IR at 1720 cm-1 would be consistent with a ketone. So maybe the product is a diketone? No, wait, if two adjacent carbonyls, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Maybe the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, but then perhaps some oxidation is happening. Oh wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dienophile or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution where the Br is replaced by OH. But with two Br atoms, that would form a diol. But the NMR doesn't show OH signals, as they're usually broad, but perhaps they exchanged and are not visible. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be an OCH2 group. But wait, that doesn't directly fit a diol.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. If two OH groups form, perhaps they lose water to form an epoxide. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a three-membered ring? No, maybe a larger ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me look at the NMR again. 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a methylene group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2O group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group. So the product after KOH treatment must have a carbonyl. So maybe elimination isn't the key here. Maybe it's oxidation. But KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of alternative possibilities. Maybe it's a substitution followed by elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes substitution with KOH, it would form 1,3-diol-adamantane. But then, the NMR would show OH groups, which are usually broad, but perhaps they're not observed in the given data. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe it's a diol, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How could KOH form a ketone from a dihalide? Oh wait, perhaps it's an example of a halogen undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, I think I'm recalling that in some cases, when two vicinal halides are present, elimination can form a carbonyl. For example, a geminal dihalide (same carbon) would eliminate to form a carbonyl. But in this case, the dihalide is vicinal (adjacent carbons). So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but some other process. Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by some ring contraction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but the IR doesn't show sp carbons. Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, but the IR would show C=C peaks around 1650 cm-1, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, maybe I should think of the product structure as a diketone. But then the IR would show two peaks around 1720 cm-1, but the question only mentions a single peak. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cycloketone.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like O. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be CH2 groups around a ring, perhaps in adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2 group. So putting it together, maybe the product after KOH is an epoxide or a ketone.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction forms a ketone via elimination and some kind of ring contraction. For example, if two HBr are eliminated from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond, but then perhaps the ring structure leads to a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring? No, but the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a carbonyl via an elimination mechanism. Oh! Maybe it's a case of forming a carbonyl via a double elimination, but I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not from elimination but from some kind of substitution with elimination. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not recalling.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are adjacent in the structure. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C3, making it 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure.

But then, why does the IR show a carbonyl peak? That's confusing. Because elimination would produce a double bond, not a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but two substitutions would form a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the initial reaction is wrong. Maybe the product isn't from elimination but from another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, which then dehydrates to form a ketone. But that would require water, which isn't present in excess KOH. Alternatively, maybe the KOH provides the hydroxide ions which, in some way, facilitate the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl via an elimination mechanism. Wait, wait a second: when a vicinal dihalide undergoes elimination, it forms an alkene. But sometimes, if there's a possibility for forming a more stable carbonyl, maybe elimination can form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman elimination, but that usually applies to amines.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group attached to something electron-withdrawing, like oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be multiple equivalent CH2 groups in the adamantane framework. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to the oxygen.

So perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone with a CH2O group attached. For example, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexanone ring attached to some adamantane structure. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The NMR at 4.79 (2H) might be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is a CH2-CO-R, where R is the adamantane framework.

So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketon-adamantane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with a CH2 group next to it.

Wait, moving on to the second step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, what's the structure of product 1? If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst for some reaction, like esterification or acetylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used in a polymerization or as a catalyst for some addition. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to diene polymerization, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an ester or an acid, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. So if product 1 is a benzene ring with a ketone group, then product 2 would have an acyl group added. But I'm not sure if product 1 is aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and aluminum isopropoxide is used to form an acetal or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the third reaction. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis condition. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. But if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

Wait, but product 2 is the result of treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something that upon ozonolysis would form certain products.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I don't know the structure of product 1. Let me try to focus on that.

Product 1's 1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and a carbonyl in IR.

So the 2H at 4.79 ppm is probably a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. The 10H in the 2.41-2.23 range could be multiple equivalent CH2 groups in a ring structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group.

So putting this together: perhaps product 1 is a compound where an adamantane fragment is attached to a carbonyl group, with a CH2-O-CH2 group or similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexenone ring attached to adamantane.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination to form a conjugated diene within the adamantane structure, which then maybe is oxidized to a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen under KOH conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which then undergoes some kind of oxidation to form a ketone. But oxidation typically requires an oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 or OsO4, which aren't mentioned here.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated dienone? No, that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a cyclic ketone. Let's imagine that the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane forms a carbonyl group. So, the structure would be a ketone in the adamantane framework.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-diketon-adamantane or something like that. But then, the NMR would show the carbonyl as a singlet, but the 4.79 ppm is a 2H multiplet, perhaps a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then what is product 2 after treatment with aluminum isopropoxide? Perhaps it's an acetylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: product 1 is an epoxide. So, the initial reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could form an epoxide. But how? Typically, epoxides form from vicinal dihalides under certain conditions, perhaps via a substitution mechanism. Wait, but in the presence of a base, like KOH, a vicinal dihalide can form an epoxide through an elimination-substitution mechanism. Let me think: the base could deprotonate, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond, but if the conditions favor epoxide formation, perhaps something else happens.

Wait, maybe it's a two-step process. First, elimination forms an alkene, but then the alkene reacts with something else. Oh, but in the presence of KOH, maybe the alkene undergoes further reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would form an epoxide. But the NMR of product 1 shows a 4.79 ppm (2H), which for an epoxide might be the CH2O groups, but usually epoxide protons are around 3-4 ppm, depending on substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or another oxygen-containing group.

But regardless, moving forward, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, perhaps product 2 is an acylated or alkylated version.

Wait, but product 1 doesn't seem aromatic. So perhaps product 2 is formed via a different reaction, like esterification or acetylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is a cyclic ether formed via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that usually needs an alkoxide and an alkyl halide, which might not fit here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diacid, but that's less likely under KOH conditions.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an acetal or something similar. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, let's proceed to the ozonolysis part. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis at -78°C with dimethyl sulfide typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups without further oxidation. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But then, product 3's NMR would show peaks corresponding to the carbonyl-adjacent protons. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to carbonyl groups, making it a triplet or some other split.

But I'm getting stuck because I don't have the exact structures. Let me try to outline the possible structures step by step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, product 1 could be 1,3-adamantadiene (a conjugated diene). But then the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be for the C=C bonds, which are around 1650 cm-1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternative: product 1 is a ketone. How?

Another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition elimination. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming 1,3-diol-adamantane. Then, product 1 would be a diol. The NMR would have O-H signals, but perhaps they are broad and not shown. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the OH groups, but I'm not sure.

If product 1 is a diol, then heating with aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) might form an acetal or some kind of cyclic ether. But I'm not certain.

But let's proceed. Suppose product 1 is a diol, structure with two OH groups on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

Heating with aluminum isopropoxide: perhaps it's a dehydration reaction, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond.

Wait, but product 1 is the diol, so product 2 would be the alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the structure of 1,3-adamantadiene. It's a conjugated diene within the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But wait, 1,3-adamantadiene is a conjugated diene, maybe something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2... but in a ring structure. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but in a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would probably yield different products. Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically form two carbonyl groups. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would become two aldehydes. So product 3 after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. The most deshielded H would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it deshielded and possibly split into a triplet or another pattern based on neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is not conjugated but isolated. For example, if product 2 is an alkene not part of a conjugated system. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Let me think about the possible NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl. Let's assume that after ozonolysis, we have a structure with a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The Hs on that CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group, perhaps, leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

Wait, the options for the coupling pattern are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. Let's think about how that might happen.

If the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet (n+1, where n=2, so triplet). But if each H is coupling with two sets of neighboring Hs, it might be a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another scenario: suppose the deshielded H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2. So the H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the middle CH2. That would give a triplet. But if there are more coupling partners, it could be more splits.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH with one H, then each H would couple with two from the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another from a neighboring group, leading to more splits.

Wait, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group. Each H in the first CH2 would see two neighboring Hs in the adjacent group, leading to a triplet. But if there are more couplings, like from another adjacent group, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the H is in a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, but that's less likely given the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a geminal di-substitution, but that's not typical.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: looking for the most deshielded H, which is likely near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. The Hs adjacent to a carbonyl are typically deshielded and appear downfield.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be next to a carbonyl group. If that H is in a CH2 group and next to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling partner, such as from a neighboring group, it might split further.

Wait, but let me think about the splitting. If each H in the CH2 group is coupling with two Hs in the adjacent CH2, that's a triplet. But if each H is also coupling with another set of Hs from a different group, like a CH group, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH group next to a carbonyl, which would make it more deshielded. But CH groups are less common than CH2 in such contexts.

Wait, maybe the product after ozonolysis is a diketone with a CH2 group next to each carbonyl. So each CH2 group would be between two carbonyls. The Hs on those CH2 would be coupled with Hs on either side, but in this scenario, perhaps only one adjacent CH2 exists. Wait, no, because if it's between two carbonyls, the CH2 would be flanked by carbonyls on both sides.

Wait, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R. Then, the CH2 groups would each be between two carbonyls. The Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is also coupled with another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between a carbonyl and another CH2, leading to coupling with two Hs on one side and possibly other couplings on the other.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the possible answer options and what they imply.

Option A: triplet. So each H has two neighbors (n=2 → triplet).

Option B: triplet of triplets. So each H is split by two different sets of J values, each causing a triplet. So it's a triplet from one coupling and another triplet from another, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Option C: doublet of triplets. So each H is split into a triplet by one coupling and a doublet by another, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Option D: pentet. n=4 → pentet, which would require each H coupling with four equivalent Hs.

Wait, a pentet would require four neighboring Hs. That's unlikely unless the H is next to a CH2 group with four Hs, which isn't possible because CH2 has two Hs. Alternatively, perhaps it's next to a CH group with two Hs and another group with two Hs, but I don't think that would give four equivalent Hs.

So more likely, the splitting is due to two neighboring groups, each contributing two Hs. That would lead to a triplet of triplets if each coupling is with two Hs, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So the first CH2's Hs couple with two Hs from the middle CH2, and the middle CH2's Hs couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. But the most deshielded H would be the one next to the carbonyl, so perhaps it's only coupled with the next CH2.

Wait, but if the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group, then each H in the first CH2 would have two Hs in the adjacent group. That would cause a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is also adjacent to another group with Hs, the first CH2 Hs could couple with both the adjacent CH2 and another group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH group. So each H would couple with two Hs from the CH2 and one H from the CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: think about common splitting patterns in ozonolysis products. Ozonolysis of a simple alkene like ethylene would give two aldehydes with no Hs adjacent. But if the alkene is part of a longer chain, the ozonolysis would give carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would yield two aldehydes, but if the alkene is isolated, like in 1-pentene, ozonolysis would give an aldehyde and a ketone.

Wait, but in our case, product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1. So product 2 could be a substituted alkene, perhaps in a ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene, and ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have a structure like two carbonyls connected by some groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to model the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. But that's unlikely as a product. Alternatively, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-R, where R is part of the adamantane structure.

In that case, the CH2 groups between the carbonyls would have Hs that are split by neighboring groups. Each H in the CH2 would see two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the CH2 is between two carbonyls and another group, such as another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between a carbonyl and a CH group. Each H in the CH2 would see two Hs from the CH group and one from another group, leading to a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options. The most likely scenario is that the H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. That would cause each H to couple with two Hs, resulting in a triplet. So the answer would be triplet (option A).

But another possibility is that the H is coupled with two Hs from one side and one from another, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH group, leading to coupling with two Hs from the CH2 and one H from the CH, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: the deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH2 group that's part of another CH2 group, leading to two coupling partners, each contributing two Hs. That would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H in the CH2 is coupled with two Hs from one side and two from another, leading to a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that the H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to a CH group. So each H would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and one H from the CH group. That would split each H into a triplet (from two Hs) and a doublet (from one H), leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but a triplet of triplets would have (2+1)*(2+1)=9 peaks, which is possible but less common than a simple triplet. Alternatively, a doublet of triplets would have 2*3=6 peaks.

Hmm, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group that's split into a triplet. So each H in the first CH2 would have a coupling with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, it would just be a triplet. So option A.

Alternatively, if the adjacent CH2 is itself split into a doublet (due to another coupling), then the first CH2's Hs would see both couplings, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. I think the most probable answer is a triplet, so option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a conjugated diene (1,3-adamantadiene). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is inconsistent with a simple alkene. This suggests the product may involve a carbonyl group, possibly due to further oxidation or rearrangement. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group (likely oxygen) and a rigid adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction with the product from Step 1. If product 1 is a ketone, product 2 could involve further functionalization, such as acylation or esterification. However, the exact structure of product 2 remains unclear without additional data.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would produce carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it highly deshielded and splitting into a specific coupling pattern.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, it would couple with two hydrogens from the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet. If additional couplings occur (e.g., from another nearby group), more complex splitting patterns like a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets could arise. However, the simplest and most likely scenario is that the hydrogen exhibits a triplet pattern due to coupling with two equivalent hydrogens.

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.
