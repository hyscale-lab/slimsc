Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. The parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. Oh right, the formula I think is plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means that as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit of parallax changes with plx. So, if we have a distribution of stars, how does their density change as a function of parallax?

Wait, I think this has something to do with the volume of space a certain parallax corresponds to. Because more distant stars have smaller parallax. So for a given range of parallax, like between plx and plx + d_plx, what's the volume of space that represents?

I recall that in three-dimensional space, the volume between two spheres (since we're considering all space up to a certain distance) is proportional to the cube of the radius. Oh wait, but we're dealing with parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance. So let's think in terms of plx.

If plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So for a small change in plx, d_plx, the corresponding change in distance is related. Let me think: d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by d_plx, then d decreases by (d_plx * d^2) because from calculus, the derivative of 1/x is -1/x². So the change in d, dd, is approximately - (d²) * d_plx.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the density of stars. Since stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed, the density is uniform, so the number of stars is proportional to the volume.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars N in that shell is proportional to d² dd. But since plx is 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx. So substituting, N is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, we're considering how N changes with the range of plx, which is d_plx. So we need to express dd in terms of d_plx.

Hmm, from plx = 1/d, taking differentials: d_plx = - (1/d²) dd. Solving for dd: dd = - d² d_plx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the sign. So dd = d² d_plx.

Now, substitute d = 1/plx into dd: dd = (1/plx)^2 d_plx.

Plugging this back into the expression for N: N is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d_plx. Wait, that's (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d_plx? No, wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, no. The volume is 4πd² dd, so N is proportional to d² * dd. We have dd = (1/plx^2) d_plx, and d is 1/plx. So substituting:

d² = (1/plx)^2.

So N is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d_plx? Wait, that can't be right. Let me see:

d² * dd = (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2) d_plx) )= (1/plx^4) d_plx.

Wait, that's N proportional to (1/plx^4) d_plx. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so d_plx is fixed. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that would be option A.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The number per unit range of plx is N per d_plx. So N = (volume) * (number density). Volume is 4πd² dd. Since number density is uniform, say n stars per volume, then N = n * 4πd² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, and dd = (1/plx^2) d_plx.

So N = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d_plx) )= n *4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

So N per unit plx (d_plx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would make the answer A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, that seems high. I thought maybe it was 1/plx^2, but according to this, it's 1/plx^4. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait another approach: the number of stars at a given distance is proportional to the surface area (d²) and the thickness (dd), which is proportional to 1/plx^4 as above. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A.

But wait, another thought: maybe I'm mixing up the variables. The question says 'per unit range of plx' as the y-axis, and how it changes with plx. So the number per unit plx interval (d_plx) is N/(d_plx), which from above is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star. For a small range of parallax \(d_{\text{plx}}\), the corresponding change in distance \(d\) is given by:

\[
d_{\text{d}} = \frac{d^2}{d_{\text{plx}}}.
\]

The number of stars in a spherical shell between distances \(d\) and \(d + d_{\text{d}}\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto d^2 \cdot d_{\text{d}}.
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(d_{\text{d}} = d^2 \cdot d_{\text{plx}}\), we find:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot d_{\text{plx}}\right) = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d_{\text{plx}}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., \(d_{\text{plx}} = 1\)) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This matches option A. The reasoning confirms that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of parallax.

Answer: A
