Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is this matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, okay, let me break it down step by step. First, I should probably write out what the matrix Ay looks like. Since S is given, and c is h/(4π), then Ay = c * S. So let's compute that.

S matrix:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Multiply each element by c = h/(4π). So,

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but matrices in quantum mechanics often have factors involving ħ (which is h/(2π)). Oh wait, the c here is h/(4π), which is ħ/2 because ħ = h/(2π). So c is ħ/2. So, the matrix becomes:

Ay = (ħ/2) * S =
[ [0, -i*(ħ/2)],
  [i*(ħ/2), 0] ]

Hmm, right. Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I need to solve the equation Ay * φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

The matrix for Ay is 2x2, so let's denote it as:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(ħ/2)],
        [i*(ħ/2), 0] ]

To find eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -i*(ħ/2) ]
[ i*(ħ/2), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i*(ħ/2))(i*(ħ/2)).

Calculating that:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (ħ/2)^2 ]

Wait, let's compute the product of those two terms. (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (1) * (ħ²/4) ) ]

Wait, that's a² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So, a² = ħ² /4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, I have a mistake here. Let me recheck the calculation.

The determinant is:

|Ay - a I| = ( -a )( -a ) - ( -iħ/2 * iħ/2 )

So that's a² - [ (-i)(i) (ħ/2)^2 ]

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So it's a² - [ (1) * (ħ^2)/(4) ) ] = 0 → a² = ħ²/4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait another thing. The angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics, for spin-1/2 particles, the components have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So that makes sense here.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2. But looking at the options, the options mention h and π. Let me express this in terms of h.

Since ħ is h/(2π), substituting, a = ± (h/(2π)) /2 = ± h/(4π). Wait, wait, wait. Wait that can't be right. Because ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π), so a is ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c S. So S must be the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, the S matrix given is:

S = [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
]

Wait, but the Pauli Y matrix is usually (0 -i; i 0). So S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Wait, no, wait. The Pauli Y matrix is σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is equal to σy. Because the given matrix S is exactly σy.

So, S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, the operator Ay is c times σy.

The eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1, so when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

Since c is h/(4
