Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That would make each charge 3.204 x 10^-19 C. 

But wait, there are 12 of these charges constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is kind of like a central charge with 12 others around it, all at the same distance. 

I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges. 

Wait, but isn't that not all the interactions? Because the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Oh right, because each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, but each is also a distance apart from each other. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So are they all at the same point, 2 meters away from P? Or are they arranged in a sphere around P?

Wait, if all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but if they are identical and constrained, maybe they are all at the same point? That can't be, because then they'd all be on top of each other and the distance between any two would be zero. But that can't be right because you can't have 12 charges at the same point without some repulsion. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify that.

Wait, maybe the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P, but arranged in some configuration, perhaps a regular dodecagon or something. But without knowing the exact arrangement, calculating the pairwise interactions between the 12 charges is tricky. Oh, but wait, the problem states that these 12 are identical and constrained at 2 m. Maybe the problem is ignoring their mutual interactions, considering only the potential due to the central charge. Or perhaps the question only asks for the potential energy of the system as a whole, considering both the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, so maybe it's the potential energy between all the charges. But how?

Wait, let's read the problem again: 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but what about the distance between each other? Hmm, perhaps because they are arranged at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not given. So perhaps the problem considers only the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 others, and not between the 12 themselves. Or perhaps the 12 are all at the same point, but that would mean their mutual potential is a lot, but that seems unlikely as a scenario.

Wait, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2 meters away from P. So the distance between any two of them is zero, which would make their mutual potential energy very high. But that doesn't make sense because that would create infinite repulsion. So I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are located on a spherical surface with radius 2 meters, each at a point on the sphere such that their mutual distances are all the same, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps we can't calculate the exact potential energy between them. Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy
