Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in a three-dimensional space, right? Because qubits are two-level systems, but the Bloch sphere is in 3D. So each state can be represented by a vector on the surface of a unit sphere, and mixed states are inside it.

Wait, the density matrix for a pure state like |0> would be |0><0|, which, when written out, would have a 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1> would have a 1 in (2,2) position. But when you take the average of these two with equal weights, that's what ρ is here. So each term is |0><0| and |1><1| multiplied by 1/2.

What's the Bloch sphere representation of this? Oh right, the Bloch vector. For a density matrix ρ, it can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three dimensions representing the Bloch vector.

So let's expand ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write down |0><0| and |1><1| as matrices. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, so ρ is (I + 0)/2 because r is zero. Because if I compare to ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then for our case, r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere. That means the state is completely mixed, a maximally mixed state. Hence, it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the correct answer should be C. Let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the density matrix being (I/2) implies that the state is a completely mixed state, so no direction in the Bloch sphere. So yes, the center is right.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) of a density matrix \( \rho \) is related to the Pauli matrices \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) through the equation:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For the given \( \rho \), it can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere, not the origin.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \( \left|1\right\rangle \), not the mixed state.  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this represents the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid state on the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
