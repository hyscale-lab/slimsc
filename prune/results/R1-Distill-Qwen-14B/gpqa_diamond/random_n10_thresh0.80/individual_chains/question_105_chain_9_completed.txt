Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. 

The scenario is that when you look at the star's brightness over time (photometric time-series), because it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So the idea is that the dip in brightness when a planet transits the star is similar to the dip caused by the spots.

We're supposed to find what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. So I think the approach is to model the brightness variation caused by the spots and by the planet, and set their amplitudes equal, then solve for Rpl/Rstar.

First, let's think about what the amplitude in the light curve depends on. For a planet transit, the dip in brightness is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. The dip is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. 

For the star with spots, the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when that hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower than when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us.

So the brightness variation depends on how much the spots cover the star and their temperature difference.

Let me try to model both cases.

Case 1: The planet transiting the star.

The fractional change in brightness (delta F) is approximately (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because when the planet transits, it blocks a circular area with radius Rp, so the area is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Case 2: The star with spots.

The star's brightness is affected by the spots. The spots are cooler (5000 K) than the rest of the star (6000 K). The total brightness of the star is the sum of the brightness from the spotted and unspotted regions.

The filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Since a hemisphere is (2π R²)/2 = π R², so total area of spots is 0.2 * π R².

Wait, but the star is being observed as it rotates, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the observed brightness, and when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, the brightness is higher.

Wait no, the way it's described, one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and the unspotted is on the back. So the brightness variation would be the difference between the star as seen from the front (spotted hemisphere) versus when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is front-facing.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are facing us (so their lower brightness is part of the observed area) and when the non-spotted regions are facing us (so the entire star is at 6000 K brightness).

Wait, no. Since the star is a sphere, when you're looking at a hemisphere, each hemisphere is half the star. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see half the star as spots and half as normal. But wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so 20% of the area of the hemisphere is spots.

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the star's entire surface is considered, and 20% of that is spots, then the area is 0.2 * 4π R². But wait, the star's radius is R, so the surface area is 4π R². Spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 4π R².

Wait, but the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps in the spotted hemisphere, 20% of its area is covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R², since a hemisphere is 2π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4 π R².

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me rephrase. The filling factor is typically the fraction of the star's surface area covered by spots. So if the entire star's surface is 4π R², and 20% is covered, that's 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8π R². But the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered. So perhaps in that hemisphere, 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. The wording is tricky. It says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R². So the spots cover 0.4π R² of the star's surface.

But when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere will come into view, and the unspotted hemisphere is on the back. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots contribute to the observed brightness, and when the unspotted is visible, the spots are on the far side.

Wait, no. When the star is viewed from Earth, which part is the hemisphere? Actually, as the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes. So if the spots are only on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots; when the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't.

Wait, but the star's equator is rotating, so it's more like the spots are on one side of the equator. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and then go out of view as the star continues to rotate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are visible (part of the star's surface) and when they're not. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact setup. Let me think of another approach.

Let me model the brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and when the unspotted is. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the brightness is lower because some spots are visible. When the unspotted is visible, the brightness is higher.

Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, when you see a hemisphere, you see half of the star's surface. If the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, we see that hemisphere (half the star) with 20% of its area covered in spots. So the brightness during that time would be the sum of the brightness from the spotted and unspotted parts.

So, the brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be:

Brightness = (Area of spotted regions * flux per unit area of spots) + (Area of unspotted regions * flux per unit area of the rest of the star).

Similarly, when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is visible, the entire visible hemisphere is at the star's normal temperature.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, when the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, the visible area is half the star's surface, which is the spotted hemisphere, and the spots cover 20% of that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it isn't.

Let me think in terms of flux.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

The star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the unspotted parts of the hemisphere.

So, the area of the spotted parts is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4 π R².

The area of the unspotted parts of the hemisphere is (hemisphere area) - (spotted area) = 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So, the flux from the spotted hemisphere is F_spotted = Area_spots * σ T_spot^4 + Area_unspotted_hemi * σ T_star^4.

Wait, no. Because the spotted hemisphere is the one we're seeing. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_visible = [Area_spots * σ (T_spot)^4 ] + [ (Area_hemi - Area_spots) * σ (T_star)^4 ].

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_unspotted_hemi = (Area_hemi) * σ (T_star)^4.

Wait, but wait. The star's other hemisphere isn't visible when the first is; it's the same as the star's normal brightness when that hemisphere is not being viewed. So the brightness variation comes from the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when the unspotted is.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the far side, but it's not emitting towards us. So the total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions (which are 0.2 of the hemisphere) and the flux from the unspotted regions of that hemisphere. The far side is not emitting towards us, so it doesn't contribute.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The entire star emits in all directions, but when you're looking at it, you see the near side (the hemisphere facing you). The far side emits, but that light doesn't reach us. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the flux from that hemisphere, including spots. When the star rotates so the other hemisphere is facing us, we see that hemisphere, which is entirely normal (no spots), assuming the spots are only on the first hemisphere.

So the brightness variation would be between the maximum brightness (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, giving the full T=6000 K) and the brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible, which includes some cooler spots.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the unspotted hemisphere is on the far side and not contributing to our observed flux. So in that case, the flux we observe is only from the visible (spotted) hemisphere.

Wait, that's right. So the star's observed flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the flux from that hemisphere (including spots), and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is from the unspotted hemisphere (no spots).

So let me model these two cases.

First, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us:

Flux_full = 2π R² * σ (T_star)^4.

Because the visible area is 2π R² (the hemisphere) and all of it is at T_star=6000 K.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us:

Flux_spotty = (Area_spots * σ T_spot^4) + (Area_unspotted_hemi * σ T_star^4).

Area_spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Area_unspotted_hemi is (2π R² ) - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So,

Flux_spotty = (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

But wait, the problem says the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K cooler, so T_spot is 5000 K.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

Flux_spotty = σ [ 0.4 π R² (5000)^4 + 1.6 π R² (6000)^4 ]

Let me compute the ratio of Flux_spotty to Flux_full.

But wait, Flux_full is when the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, right? Because when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, that's the case.

Wait, no, wait. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, so Flux_full is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the Flux_spotty is as calculated.

So the fractional brightness is Flux_spotty / Flux_full.

But the observed variation would be the difference between the maximum (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) and the minimum (when the spotted is visible).

Wait, no. Because when the star is rotating, the brightness goes up and down. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we have maximum brightness, and when the spotted hemisphere is facing, lower brightness.

The amplitude of the variation would be (Flux_max - Flux_min)/Flux_max. Wait, or perhaps the amplitude is the peak-to-peak difference divided by the average. But I think for the purpose of this problem, the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is (Flux_max - Flux_spotty) / Flux_max.

Let me compute Flux_max and Flux_spotty.

Flux_max = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Flux_spotty = 2π R² σ [ 0.2 * (5000)^4 + 0.8 * (6000)^4 ].

Because 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots and 0.8 is normal.

Wait, because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the fraction of the hemisphere is 0.2.

So, the Flux_spotty is:

2π R² σ [ 0.2 * (5000)^4 + 0.8 * (6000)^4 ].

So the fractional change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

delta_F = (Flux_max - Flux_spotty) / Flux_max.

Let's compute that.

Flux_max = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Flux_spotty = 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(5000^4) + 0.8*(6000^4) ].

So,

delta_F = [ (6000^4) - (0.2*5000^4 + 0.8*6000^4) ] / (6000^4)

Simplify numerator:

= (6000^4) - 0.2*(5000^4) - 0.8*(6000^4)
= (1 - 0.8) * 6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4
= 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4
= 0.2 [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So,

delta_F = [ 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [ (6000^4)/(6000^4) - (5000^4)/(6000^4) ) ]

= 0.2 [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ]

Compute (5/6)^4.

5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

delta_F ≈ 0.2 [ 1 - 0.482253 ] = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.1035494.

So delta_F is about 10.35% dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Now, the planet transit case. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. 

We need to set this equal to delta_F, which is about 0.1035.

So (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait. That's a radius ratio of approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.39 

B) ~0.07 

C) ~0.11 

D) ~0.32 

So option D is about 0.32.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the amplitude due to the spots is a dip of about 10.35% in brightness, which is larger than the planet's dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, so about 0.32. So option D.

But wait, the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the planet's radius is Rpl. So Rpl/Rstar = 0.32 would mean a planet about 32% the size of the Sun. But wait, the Sun's radius is about 1.4 million kilometers, so a planet of 0.32 times that would be almost 450,000 km radius. That's way larger than Jupiter, which has a radius of about 70,000 km. So that's impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Because Jupiter's radius is about 1/10th of the Sun's radius. So 0.32 would be a planet much larger than Jupiter, which is unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the brightness variation caused by the spots.

Wait another approach: the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness when the spots rotate into and out of view. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the entire star is at 6000 K (unspotted hemisphere), and the minimum is when the entire star is at 5000 K (but that's not the case because only one hemisphere is spotty). Hmm, no. The problem says one hemisphere is covered, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the difference between when the unspotted hemisphere is visible and when the spotted is.

Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no, because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so it's 0.2 of the 2π R² area.

Wait, why did I write 0.2 * 2π R²? Because the hemisphere area is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4π R².

Wait, perhaps the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R², so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotted = (0.4π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Which simplifies to:

F_spotted = 0.4π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6π R² σ (6000^4).

And F_unspotted (when the other hemisphere is visible) is F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

So the brightness variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4) - [0.4π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6π R² σ (6000^4)].

Simplify:

= [2π R² σ (6000^4) ] - [ 0.4π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6π R² σ (6000^4) ]

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6000^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

So the fractional change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

= [ 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [ 2 π R² σ (6000^4) ]

The π, R², and σ terms cancel out.

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [ 2 *6000^4 ]

= [0.4/2 ] * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before, (5/6)^4 is approximately 0.482253.

So,

= 0.2 * (1 - 0.482253) = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.1035494.

So the fractional dip is about 10.35% when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Now, the planet's dip when transiting is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32.

So the planet's radius would be about 0.32 times the star's radius, which is option D.

But wait, as I thought earlier, that would imply a planet larger than Jupiter. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1005 R_sun (since the Sun's radius is about 1.4 million km, Jupiter is about 70,000 km, so 7e4 / 1.4e6 ≈ 0.05, wait, no, 7e4 / 1.4e6 is 0.05, so Jupiter is about 5% the Sun's radius. So a planet with 32% of the Sun's radius is much larger than Jupiter, which isn't impossible but is much larger. Maybe that's correct in this hypothetical scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the brightness variation. Let me check again.

Wait, when the star is unspotted (the other hemisphere), the flux is F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = [0.2 * 2π R² * (5000^4) ] + [0.8 * 2π R² * (6000^4) ].

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the spotted hemisphere, 20% of the hemisphere is spots, so the flux from the spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R² * (5000^4), and the rest is 0.8 * 2π R² * (6000^4).

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux would be F_spotted = 2π R² [ 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 + 0.8*(6000/6000)^4 ] * 6000^4 σ.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So, F_spotted = 2π R² * [ 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 + 0.8*(6000/6000)^4 ] * σ (6000^4).

Wait, no, wait. The flux is in terms of T^4 per unit area. So the total flux is the sum over all areas.

Alternatively, perhaps the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted = (Area_spots * (T_spot^4) + Area_unspotted * T_normal^4) / Total_area * 4π R².

Wait, perhaps another approach: the overall brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the rest of the visible hemisphere.

So the flux is:

F_spotted = (Area_spots * σ T_spot^4) + (Area_unspotted_visible * σ T_normal^4).

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_unspotted = (Area_unspotted_hemi * σ T_normal^4).

So, the maximum brightness is F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

The minimum brightness is F_spotted = (0.2 * 2π R²) σ (5000^4) + (1.8 * 2π R²) σ (6000^4).

Wait, wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So,

F_spotted = (0.4π R²) σ (5000^4) + (2π R² - 0.4π R²) σ (6000^4).

= 0.4π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6π R² σ (6000^4).

So,

F_spotted = π R² σ [ 0.4*(5000^4) + 1.6*(6000^4) ].

F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

The dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4) - π R² σ [0.4*(5000^4) + 1.6*(6000^4) ].

= π R² σ [ 2*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) - 1.6*(6000^4) ]

= π R² σ [ (2 -1.6) 6000^4 - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= π R² σ [ 0.4*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ].

The fractional dip is (0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]) / (2π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify:

= (0.4 / 2) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before, 0.2 * (1 - 0.482253) ≈ 0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.1035494.

So the dip is about 10.35% of the original flux.

So to get the same dip from a planet transit, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But I'm a bit concerned because when I think about Jupiter, it's about 0.1 R_sun, but 0.32 R_sun is way larger than Jupiter. But maybe in this hypothetical scenario, it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the amplitude is the change in brightness divided by the original brightness. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, but I think in this case, the maximum is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_spotted.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted = 0.1035, which is about 10%.

But in the planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the variation as a periodic signal. The star's brightness varies by about 10%, so a planet would need to cause a 10% dip, which requires a radius about 32% that of the star.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So the answer is D, 0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the star with spots, we analyze the brightness changes caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered by dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \).

3. **Spot-Induced Brightness Variation**:
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the observed brightness is reduced due to the cooler spots.
   - The total flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \left(0.2 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4\right) + \left(0.8 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4\right),
     \]
     where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4.
     \]
   - The fractional brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}.
     \]

### Calculation of Brightness Variation:
1. Substitute the flux expressions:
   \[
   \Delta F = \frac{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 - \left(0.2 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 + 0.8 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4\right)}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4}.
   \]
2. Simplify:
   \[
   \Delta F = \frac{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 - 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4}.
   \]
   \[
   \Delta F = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4}.
   \]
3. Cancel terms:
   \[
   \Delta F = \frac{0.4 \cdot \left(T_{\text{star}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{2T_{\text{star}}^4}.
   \]
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}}\right)^4\right).
   \]
4. Substitute \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482253.
   \]
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot \left(1 - 0.482253\right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.1035.
   \]

### Planet Radius for Same Brightness Variation:
The dip caused by the planet is \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F \). Setting \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035 \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
\]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
