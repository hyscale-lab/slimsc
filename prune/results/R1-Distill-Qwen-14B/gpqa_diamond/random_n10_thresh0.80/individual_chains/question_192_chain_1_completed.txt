Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges, especially when they're uncharged or have cavities.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So s must be less than R since the cavity is entirely inside. Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. Hmm, that might affect the position of the charge relative to point P.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges in cavities. I think that when a conductor is neutral (uncharged) and has a cavity with a charge inside, the conductor itself doesn't have free charges initially. But when you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface develops an induced charge. Oh right, the inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So if there's a +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q.

But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged as a whole. Oh, because the problem says it's uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. That means the outer surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite to the inner surface. Because the inner is -q, the outer must be +q? Or wait, no, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must get +q to balance it, right? Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no, wait! Let me think. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of all charges on it is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the conductor must have a net charge of zero, which is the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The charge inside the cavity induces a charge on the inner surface. So the inner surface would have -q because of the +q inside. To make the total conductor charge zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that for a spherical conductor with charge Q, the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So the field outside depends on the total charge outside. In this case, the outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be as if a charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P is due to the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor (where the charge effectively is located) to point P.

Looking back at the options, option B says (q/(4πε₀ L²)), which matches this reasoning. So that's probably the answer.

Alternatively, what about the other options? Option A and C involve (l ± s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like it's using the distance from the point P to the charge inside the cavity, which is at distance l but considering the displacement due to the s and theta. But wait, no. Because the field outside a conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface. The inner charge's field would be canceled outside the conductor because of the shielding effect. So the field outside is as if there's a charge +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity.

So the presence of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field except for inducing the +q on the outer surface. Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the outer charge, which is +q at the center. So the magnitude is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged and has a small cavity with a charge $+q$ placed inside. This induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the cavity. Since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. In this case, the outer surface has a charge $+q$. The field at a point $P$ outside the conductor depends only on this outer charge and is as if the charge were located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside depends only on the outer charge and not on the position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which correctly represents the field due to the outer charge $+q$ at a distance $L$.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Suggests the field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately represents the electric field outside the conductor due to the induced charge on the outer surface.

Answer: B
