Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected. Both planets are similar to Neptune in mass. Oh right, Neptune is less massive than Jupiter, but more than Earth. So the RV method's shift depends on the planet's mass and the star's mass.

The key data points are the shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the RV method's measured shift (the semi-amplitude) depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Oh wait, there's a formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. Let me try to recall it.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But wait, the actual formula involving the planet's and star's properties... I think it's something like K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3))) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think of the formula in terms of known variables.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)). But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), the term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1, so that part can be ignored. So K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no. Wait, let's find the correct formula. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * P )^(-1/3) * ( (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) ] * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K ≈ (G * P )^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should write this more clearly. Let me think about the formula.

The exact formula (from what I remember) is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / [ ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) *
