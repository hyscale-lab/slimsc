Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is defined as lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 +3 =6. So lithium-6. The symbol for that is Li-6. So X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are significant. So I can't use classical mechanics here; I need to use special relativity formulas.

The energy we're looking for is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, does the question ask for the kinetic energy or the total energy? Looking back at the question: it says the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy, but in particle physics, sometimes the total energy is considered. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. I'll have to clarify this.

Wait, the RHIC's energy is given in terms of the beam energy. If the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, then the total energy would be gamma*m*c², but if they're asking for the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1)*m*c². So which one is it? The question says, "the energy of the RHIC," which is usually the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. But sometimes people refer to the total energy as the beam energy. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total energy and see which option fits, then think about whether it's kinetic or total. Let me proceed.

First, calculate gamma. v is 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Let me compute (0.96)^2: 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Take the square root of 0.0784. What's that? Hmm, 0.28 because 0.28² = 0.0784. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? Let's check: 0.28*0.28 = 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let's compute that.

1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is 1? 0.28 *3.5 is 0.98. 0.28 *3.5714 is 1, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is needed. The mass number A is 6, so the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So the mass of the nucleus is 6 * u.

Wait, but maybe I should use the actual mass of Li-6. Because sometimes isotopes have slightly different masses. Oh, but for this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6u, since the exact mass might not be needed if the problem expects an approximate answer.

But wait, the problem gives options to four decimal places, so probably I should use more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

Wait, let me think again. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the mass of Li-6 is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) u.

Let me compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.

3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.

Total mass: 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u.

So the mass of the nucleus (m) is 6.047823 u.

But wait, the atomic mass unit is a unit of mass. To find the rest energy, I need to compute m*c². But in calculations, when we use the mass in u, the energy in MeV can be found by m*c² = mass_in_u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, yes, because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m*c² = (mass in u) * 931.5 MeV.

So for Li-6, the rest energy is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.
