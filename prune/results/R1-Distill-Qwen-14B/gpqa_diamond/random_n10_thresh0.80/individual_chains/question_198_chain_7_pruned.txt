Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, I need to make sure I'm understanding the complexes correctly. I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases with more SCN- attached. So Co with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN ligands.

The question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co with two SCN- ligands. So that's the β2 complex.

I remember that the distribution of species in a solution with ligands can be found using the stability constants. The idea is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex, and then find the percentage for the desired one.

So the approach might involve setting up an equilibrium expression for each complex and then using the β values to find the fraction of each. I think the general formula for the fraction of a complex with n ligands is (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum of all β_k [SCN]^k for k=0 to 4)).

Wait, but since the problem gives β1 to β4, I think the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4? So four possible complexes, each with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ions.

Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" which suggests the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. So for that, we need the fraction of the species where n=2.

So the formula for the fraction f_n is [β_n [SCN]^n] / [sum (β_k [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4)], but wait, what about [Co] itself? Because Co(II) can exist as free ions or complexes. Oh right, the free Co^2+ would correspond to k=0, but since β0 is 1 (because it's the standard), but wait, no, β is the formation constant. So, the formation of [Co(SCN)] from Co^2+ and SCN- is given by β1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co][SCN]). So the fractions would involve each complex's concentration divided by the total concentration of all species.

Alternatively, the distribution can be calculated using the formula:

For each complex [CoSCN]_n, the fraction is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum for all m β_m [SCN]^m)

So, the denominator will be the sum of β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, β0 is 1, because β0 is the stability constant for the complex when n=0, which is just the free ion. Or wait, maybe not. Because β is for the complexation. So for Co^2+ without any SCN, β0 is 1. So [Co^2+] = [Co] / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN]^n) ) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But when calculating the distribution, the fraction of each species is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k ), where β_0 is 1 because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+ and β0 = 1.

Wait, yes, because for n=0 (free Co^2+), the expression would be [Co^2+] = (β0 [SCN]^0) / (sum...), which is 1 * 1 / denominator. So the denominator is the sum of all β_m [SCN]^m, where m ranges from 0 to 4.

So the fractions are:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN]^m )

So, for each complex, their fraction is their β multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all β_m [SCN]^m from m=0 to 4.

In this problem, we're to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, so β2=40.

Given:

β0 = 1 (since it's the free ion)
β1 =9
β2=40
β3=63
β4=16

[SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term in the denominator:

Term for m=0: β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1

m=1: β1 [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 =0.9

m=2: 40*(0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So sum all these:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+ 0.4 → 2.3

+ 0.063 → 2.363

+ 0.0016 → 2.3646

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is (40 * 0.1^2 ) / 2.3646 → (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So 0.169 is about 16.9%. Looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, I thought the [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Did I mix up the dithiocyanato vs others?

Wait, sometimes the color depends on the number of ligands. I think the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, and higher coordination might be different colors. But the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato, so yes, that's n=2.

So the calculation leads to approximately 16.9% which is option D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the equilibrium distribution formula. The stability constants are given as β₀ = 1 (free Co²⁺), β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of a species with n ligands is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]

Here, the denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m\) for \(m = 0\) to \(m = 4\). Substituting the values:

- For \(m = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- For \(m = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- For \(m = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- For \(m = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- For \(m = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \
