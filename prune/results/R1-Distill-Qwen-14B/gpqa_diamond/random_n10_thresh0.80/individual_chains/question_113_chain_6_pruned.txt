Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with similar structures but varying in the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

First, I'll go through each piece of data given and try to interpret what they mean.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group (-OH) or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak too, but it's usually around 2500-3300. Hmm, but the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H for alcohols. Or maybe it's an alcohol.

Next, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I know that the 1700 region is where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 peak might be an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene), or maybe another carbonyl group but in a different environment. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than the typical 1700. Oh wait, maybe it's an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one and an aromatic ring. Alternatively, the 1650 could correspond to an amide or something else, but since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not. Wait, but the options are all O-containing, so maybe it's a combination of carbonyl and another group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a
