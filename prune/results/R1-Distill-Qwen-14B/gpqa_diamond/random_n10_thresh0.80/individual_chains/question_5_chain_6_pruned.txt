Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me see. The operator is P, and it's given along with its components in the X, Y, and Z directions. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the direction is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction n can be parameterized by some angle theta, maybe? Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction would be something like (cos(theta), 0, sin(theta)). So the operator P is proportional to the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components, right?

Wait, the components are given as P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix. P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. P_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y. P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z.

So the operator vector P is a vector operator made up of these components. So the operator in the direction n would be P·n, where n is a unit vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, it's (cos(theta), 0, sin(theta)).

So the operator P along n is P·n = P_x cos(theta) + P_z sin(theta). Because the Y component is zero here.

So P·n would be (ħ/2) [cos(theta) X + sin(theta) Z]. Let me write that out. X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So putting it together:

(ħ/2) * [ [ sin(theta)*1, cos(theta)*1 ],
           [ cos(theta)*1, -sin(theta)*1 ] ]

Wait, let's compute that matrix. First, cos(theta) multiplied by X gives [[0, cos(theta)], [cos(theta), 0]]. Then sin(theta) multiplied by Z gives [[sin(theta), 0], [0, -sin(theta)]]. So adding them together:

Top left: sin(theta)
Top right: cos(theta)
Bottom left: cos(theta)
Bottom right: -sin(theta)

Then multiplied by ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ [ (ħ/2) sin(theta), (ħ/2) cos(theta) ],
  [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), -(ħ/2) sin(theta) ] ]

So we're looking for the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ (ħ/2) sin(theta) - ħ/2, (ħ/2) cos(theta) ],
  [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), -(ħ/2) sin(theta) - ħ/2 ] ] * [a; b] = 0.

Wait, because (P·n) has elements (ħ/2) times the matrix I wrote before. So P·n - (ħ/2) I is:

[ [ (ħ/2)(sin(theta) - 1), (ħ/2) cos(theta) ],
  [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), (ħ/2)(-sin(theta) -1 ) ] ]

Which can be factored as (ħ/2) times:

[ [ sin(theta) - 1, cos(theta) ],
  [ cos(theta), -sin(theta) -1 ] ]

The determinant must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Alternatively, we can write the equations for a and b.

First equation: (sin(theta) - 1) a + cos(theta) b = 0.

Second equation: cos(theta) a + (-sin(theta) -1 ) b = 0.

Let me take the first equation: (sin(theta) -1 ) a + cos(theta) b =0.

From this, maybe express a in terms of b.

a = [ - cos(theta) / (sin(theta) -1) ] b.

Wait, let me compute sin(theta) -1. Let's factor out a negative to make it -(1 - sin(theta)), so:

a = [ -cos(theta) / ( - (1 - sin(theta)) ) ] * b
= [ cos(theta) / (1 - sin(theta)) ) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps to simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin(theta)):

cos(theta) (1 + sin(theta)) / [ (1 - sin(theta))(1 + sin(theta)) ) ]
Denominator becomes 1 - sin^2(theta) = cos^2(theta).

So numerator is cos(theta) (1 + sin(theta)), denominator cos^2(theta).

So a = [ (1 + sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ) ] b.

So a = [ (1 + sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ) ] b.

Let me write that as a = [ (1 + sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ] b.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's make a substitution. Let me think about the eigenvector condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector corresponds to spin-up in the direction n. So the spin state would be |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>.

But wait, in this problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is zero because it's along x-z, meaning phi=0. So the state would be cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>.

But
