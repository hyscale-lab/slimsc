Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I remember that transit probability has to do with the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors that influence it. Let me think.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. That means their minimum masses are known, along with their orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which probably means their actual masses are the same since RV gives a minimum mass, and they're Earth-like. 

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much faster. Both have circular orbits, so no eccentricity to worry about. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, their host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, but how does that affect transit probability? Oh, right, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. If the star is bigger, the planet is a smaller fraction of the star's disk, making the transit less likely to be detected. But since both stars have the same radius, that factor is the same for both. So maybe the size of the planet doesn't play a role here since they're Earth-like and probably similar in size.

Wait, but in this case, the radii of the stars are the same. So the planet-to-star radius ratio is the same for both planets. So maybe the star's mass isn't the factor that affects the transit probability in this case?

Wait, no, the transit probability is primarily about how likely the orbit is aligned edge-on from our point of view. The probability is higher when the star's size is such that the planet's orbital plane is more likely to cross our line of sight. Hmm, but I think the main factor here is the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius.

Wait, the probability of transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) ), but wait, no. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)^2 * (a / R_*) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively,
