Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking what the energy of the collider is when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. I need to calculate the energy, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, let me think. First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons + neutrons. Lithium has 3 protons, so 3 +3 =6. So it's Li-6, right?

Now, RHIC is a collider, so it's probably dealing with relativistic particles. The speed is 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty high. Relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

The energy in a collider refers to the kinetic energy each particle has. But wait, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But sometimes, people refer to it as the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused about that. Wait, no, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So, the energy we're looking for is the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest energy.

So first, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. The speed v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28, correct. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714286.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass, which I can find using the periodic table. Let me think: the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, actually, for a single nucleus, we need the molar mass converted to atomic mass units (u).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me be precise. The molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 g/mol. So the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is 6.941 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol⁻¹), but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, each atom has a mass in u. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 u. Because the atomic mass is the molar mass in grams divided by Avogadro's number to get grams per atom, but when converted to u (atomic mass units), it's approximately 6.941 u for Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value. Let me think: the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol, which is 6.941 grams per mole. Since 1 mole is Avogadro's number of atoms, the mass of each atom is 6.941 g / 6.022e23 atoms ≈ 1.152e-23 grams. To convert grams to atomic mass units, I know that 1 u is approximately 1.6605e-27 grams. So dividing 1.152e-23 g by 1.6605e-27 g/u gives about 6941 u? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: 1.152e-23 / 1.6605e-27 = (1.152 / 1.6605) * 1e4. Let me compute 1.152 / 1.6605 ≈ 0.694. Multiply by 1e4, so 6940 u. That makes sense because Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6.94 g/mol, so each atom is approximately 6.94 u. Oh, so I was overcomplicating it. So the rest mass energy is m c², where m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus in kg.

Wait, but in terms of energy, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is 6.941 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that: 6.941 * 931.5 ≈ let's see, 6 * 931.5 is 5589, 0.941 * 931.5 is approximately 878. So total is about 5589
