Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton chain, and the question is specifically talking about the pp-III branch stopping. The pp-III branch is one of the later stages in the proton-proton cycle, right? So, the pp-III process contributes to the production of high-energy neutrinos, particularly the Beryllium-7 neutrinos.

Wait, the Sun's core fusion primarily uses the pp chain, which has branches. The main pp-I branch produces two positrons and two neutrinos. Then, there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less dominant but still significant. The pp-III branch involves the capture of a proton by a carbon-13 nucleus to make nitrogen-14, which then decays into carbon-13 again, releasing a helium-4 nucleus. This process is known for producing higher-energy neutrinos, I think around 1 MeV or so.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then that particular source of neutrinos would be cut off. But the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, and any other fusion processes (like the CNO cycle) continue as usual.

Now, the question asks about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second, so the ratio tells us how the number of neutrinos in these two bands changes.

I remember that in the Sun, the dominant neutrino emission comes from the pp-I branch, which emits neutrinos with lower energies, around 0.5 MeV or so. But the pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos, maybe in the 1-2 MeV range. Wait, but the question's bands are in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, so both are below the 1 MeV mark. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the exact energy ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes more to the higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more than in the lower ones. But I'm trying to figure out the specific bands given.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos when a proton is captured by C-13, producing N-14, which then emits a positron and a neutrino to become C-13 again. The neutrinos in this case are the ones from the decay of N-14, which are the ³He neutrinos, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos because the involved particles have higher energies.

But if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process stop. So the flux from that source would drop. But other neutrino sources, like the pp-I branch, would continue.

Wait, the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which contributes about 86% of the solar neutrino flux. The pp-II and pp-III contribute about 14%, with pp-III being a small part of that. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in the higher energy bands would decrease, but the lower bands would be less affected.

But in the question, both bands are in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV range. Let's think about where the neutrinos from each process lie.

The neutrinos from the pp-I branch have energies around 0.5 MeV (500 keV), so they're in the lower keV range. The pp-II branch produces neutrinos in a similar energy range. The pp-III branch, I think, produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1 MeV or so. So if that process stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2, 800-900 keV) would drop, but the lower ones (700-800 keV) would be mostly unaffected because they're coming from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are still active.

Wait, but wait. The pp-III branch's neutrinos—do they fall into band 1 or band 2? The neutrino energies from pp-III might be higher than 800 keV, so they would contribute to band 2. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos in band 2 would decrease, but band 1 (700-800 keV) would remain mostly the same.

So the initial flux ratio is (flux1)/(flux2) = (unchanged)/(reduced). So if the pp-III contributes a significant portion to band
