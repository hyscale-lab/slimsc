Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, let's see. It's about electric fields and conductors. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to visualize it.

So, there's a spherical conductor, right? And it's uncharged initially. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance 's' away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and it's smaller than the conductor's radius 'R'. 

Now, a small positive charge '+q' is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is 'l', and both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

I remember that conductors have some specific properties when it comes to charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges reside on the surface of a conductor. But wait, since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when you have a charge inside a cavity, how does that affect the conductor?

Oh wait, there's a concept called electrostatic shielding. I think that if a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's interior doesn't feel that charge's electric field. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the net charge is zero. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, wouldn't it induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces?

Wait, no. Wait, if the conductor is neutral, the charges inside the cavity would induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, and a positive charge on the outer surface to balance it out. Oh wait, no, because the conductor is initially neutral. So the inner surface would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero (since it's uncharged), so the outer surface must have +q, the same as the charge inside the cavity but positive. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of charges on inner and outer surfaces must be zero. So, the inner surface (inside the cavity) would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge is zero. So yeah, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, when considering the electric field at P, we can treat the conductor as if all its charge is at the center because of the shell theorem. Wait, but the conductor's charge is distributed on the outer surface. So, any point outside a spherical shell of charge will experience the field as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So, the field outside should be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. But wait, does that make sense? Because the conductor was initially neutral, and the charge inside the cavity induces a redistribution. Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface ends up with +q, so the field outside is as if there's a charge +q at the center.

But wait, the conductor is a spherical shell. The charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), since L is the distance from the center.

But wait, the options have other possibilities. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That seems to fit. But wait, why are the other variables like s, l, and theta even mentioned in the question if the answer doesn't depend on them?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The charge is placed inside the cavity, but the conductor is a sphere. The presence of the cavity and the charge inside it affects the inner surface, but the outer surface is the one contributing to the field outside.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity. The cavity's center is offset by a distance 's' from the conductor's center. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. So, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. Oh, this might complicate things.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. The conductor's inner surface will have a charge of -q because of the +q in the cavity, regardless of where the cavity is placed. But the outer surface would have +q to balance it. So, the outer surface's charge is +q, but since the conductor is a spherical shell, the outer surface's charge would be uniformly distributed only if there are no other external fields or asymmetries. But in this case, the cavity is displaced, so the inner surface isn't a uniform sphere. Wait, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute to cancel internal fields.

Wait, perhaps the displacement of the cavity affects the inner and outer charge distributions. Let me think: the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is inside, but not at the center. So, when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor, but this inner surface isn't a sphere because the cavity is displaced. So, the inner surface is a non-spherical shape, but the conductor's outer surface remains a sphere because it's a conductor, right?

Wait, no. The conductor itself is a sphere. The inner cavity is off-center. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge. But since the cavity isn't at the center, the inner surface can't be a sphere. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) would have an induced charge. But the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. So, the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform because there's no external field or asymmetries—except that the inner charge distribution isn't uniform. But wait, the conductor's outer surface will adjust to any induced charges, but since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the inner surface. Wait, no. The inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. So, the outer surface is a sphere with +q on it.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor?

Oh, right! The field outside a spherical shell of charge is as if the charge were at the center. So, the electric field at point P outside the conductor (distance L from the center of the conductor) would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside depends only on that.

But wait, why are the other variables given then? The options have expressions that involve s, l, and theta. So, perhaps my initial thought is incorrect. Maybe the field isn't just due to the outer charge. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and outer surface has +q. So, the net charge on the conductor is zero. Now, when you're outside the conductor, the field should be due to the total charge enclosed, which is the sum of the charges inside the conductor. Wait, the conductor itself is neutral, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the inner surface is -q, outer surface +q. So, the total charge inside the conductor (excluding the cavity) is zero, but the enclosed charge for a point outside is the charge inside the cavity plus the conductor's charges, which would be +q (cavity) + (-q inner) + (+q outer) = +q. Wait, but the outer surface is +q, so the total is +q.

Wait, maybe the field outside is only due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So, the field should be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

But the options have other possibilities. Let's see: option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). So, that fits.

But why are the other variables like l and s given? Could it be that the field isn't just from the outer surface, but also from the inner surface or the charge inside the cavity?

Wait, no. Because inside a conductor, the electric field is zero. So, the inner cavity's charge is shielded from the conductor's interior. So, any point outside the conductor will see the field due to the conductor's charges, which is +q on the outer surface. So, the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

But perhaps the point P is not on the axis. Oh, right, the problem states that the distance l (from P to the cavity's center) is l, and there's an angle theta between l and s (the distance between the centers of the conductor and cavity).

Wait, wait. Let me consider the geometry here. The conductor's center is O, and the cavity's center is O'. The distance between O and O' is s. The point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from O. The distance from P to O' is l. So, the vector from O to O' is s, and the vector from O to P is L.

So, the vector from O' to P is l, but the displacement from O to P is L, and O to O' is s. So, using the law of cosines, we can relate these vectors. The angle between O'P and OO' is theta.

So, the vector from O' to P is l. The vector from O to P is L. The displacement between O and O' is s. So, the triangle formed by O, O', and P has sides s, L, and l. The angle at O is theta.

Wait, perhaps the field due to the charge inside the cavity and the induced charges needs to be considered. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside is as if it's a point charge at O. But the inner cavity's charge is +q, but that's inside the conductor, so outside, I thought it doesn't contribute.

Hmm, but wait, maybe the conductor's inner surface charge and the charge inside the cavity affect the field outside. Or perhaps not. Because the conductor shields the inside from the outside.

Wait, conductors shield external electric fields from getting inside, but do internal charges affect the exterior? No, because the conductor's material redistributes charges to cancel internal fields in the conductor, but the charges on the outer surface will produce their own field.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of this as a Gaussian surface. Imagine a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The total charge enclosed by this surface would be the sum of the charges inside the conductor. But the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge inside is zero. Wait, but the cavity has a charge +q. Oh, right, because the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, no. Gaussian surfaces are surfaces in space. If the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor, then it encloses the entire conductor plus the cavity. The charge inside the Gaussian surface would be the charge in the cavity (q) plus the conductor's charge. But the conductor's net charge is zero, so the total charge enclosed is +q. Therefore, by Gauss's law, the flux through the Gaussian surface would be q_enc / ε₀. So, the electric field at a point outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center.

Wait, so that would suggest that the field outside depends only on the charge in the cavity and the conductor's induced charges, but the conductor's total charge is zero, so the field is as if the charge were at the center. So the correct answer is option B.

But why are the variables l, s, and theta given in the problem? Because if the setup was that the conductor is a sphere, then the field only depends on the distance from its center. So, the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think about whether the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the external field. Since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere with charge +q, the field outside should be the same regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is located. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the cavity's charge is at the center. But in our case, the cavity is off-center. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface must remain a sphere since the conductor is spherical. The inner surface of the conductor, which is the cavity's wall, is where the induced charges reside. But the inner surface isn't a sphere because the cavity is off-center. So, the inner surface has a charge of -q, but its distribution is not uniform.

Wait, but the outer surface must be a sphere because the conductor is a sphere. The outer surface's charge is +q, so the charge distribution on the outer surface must be uniform because it's a conductor. Because any non-uniform distribution would create an internal field, which would cause charges to move until the distribution is uniform. So the outer surface is uniformly distributed, and the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait a second, but the presence of the displaced inner charge could induce some dipole field? No, because the outer surface is a uniform sphere. So, the electric field outside would only be due to the monopole term, which is the +q at the center. So the field at P is as if it's a point charge at O, the center of the conductor.

So the answer would be option B. But why are the other variables given? Perhaps this is a trick question, making the examinee consider the displacement, but the correct answer doesn't depend on it.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged with +q. Then, the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². Because L is the distance from the center.

So, the correct answer is option B. The other options involve l and theta, which don't affect the outcome because the field outside a spherical shell only depends on the distance from the center, regardless of where the charge is placed inside.

So, I think the answer is option B.


The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conductor Properties**: The conductor is initially uncharged, meaning its total net charge is zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to electrostatic induction). To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge is determined by the total charge enclosed within the shell, regardless of the distribution of the charge on the shell. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge of $+q$, the electric field at any point outside the conductor (including point $P$) is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of Displacement**: The displacement of the cavity (and hence the charge $+q$) from the center of the conductor does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface of the conductor remains uniformly charged with $+q$, and the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed by the conductor, not on the internal distribution of charges.

4. **Relevance of Variables**: The variables $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ are given in the problem but do not influence the electric field at point $P$. The field outside the conductor is solely determined by the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's law, the electric field at point $P$ can be calculated as:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches option **B**.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The displacement of the cavity and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the field. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
