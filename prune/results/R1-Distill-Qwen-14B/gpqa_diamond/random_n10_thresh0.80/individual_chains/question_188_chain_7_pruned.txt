Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, what do I remember about interplanar distances and crystals?

Wait, I think the interplanar distance formula is something like d = (a)/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with angles?)). Oh right, for a cubic system, it's just d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I need the more general formula.

Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal but angles can be different, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. Oh wait, the formula for interplanar distances in rhombohedral systems must involve the lattice parameters and the angles.

I recall the formula for interplanar spacing is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, is that right? Or is there a different formula? Alternatively, another approach is using the Miller indices and the structure factor, but maybe the formula I thought of is correct.

Wait, another way: the interplanar distance d is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α)/(a²). Or maybe I'm mixing the angles. Because in the rhombohedral system, the angles are between the axes, so
