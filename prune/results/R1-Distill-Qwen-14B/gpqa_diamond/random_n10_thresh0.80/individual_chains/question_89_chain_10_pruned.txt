Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. So when it's heated with excess KOH, what happens?

I think KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions. So, maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromines, perhaps it'll eliminate twice. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantaneâ€”eliminating two HBr molecules would form a diene, right? Because each elimination removes H and Br and forms a double bond. So two eliminations would form two double bonds.

But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's a ring-opening or a rearrangement? Alternatively, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation forming an allene or maybe a conjugated diene. But the product is called product 1, and it's then used in the next step.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but if the first step is elimination, maybe the product is a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, elimination would form a double bond, but if the base is strong and conditions are right, perhaps elimination leads to an alkyne? No, that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Oh wait, KOH can also do substitution. But with two leaving groups, elimination is more likely, especially with a strong base like KOH.

Wait, but if two eliminations happen, maybe it forms a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a conjugated diene. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is confusing because that's more like a carbonyl. So perhaps the first step doesn't form a diene but a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. If the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then eliminates Br- and forms a carbonyl group. Oh wait, that would require a neighboring group. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so maybe the elimination forms two ketones. But the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl protons. Wait, in the NMR, the peak at 4.79 ppm is 2H. That's a high shift for CH2. Maybe that's an oxygenated CH2, like adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a cyclohexenone derivative. But I'm not sure. Let's move on to the next step to see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, if product 1 is some kind of ketone or has an acyl group, then maybe Friedel-Crafts would occur. But wait, product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an acyl chloride or ketone.

Alternatively, heating with aluminum isopropoxide could induce another reaction, like a dehydration or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the typical peak for an epoxide.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If it's elimination, each Br can be removed with a base abstracting a proton. The two deprotonations would lead to two double bonds.
