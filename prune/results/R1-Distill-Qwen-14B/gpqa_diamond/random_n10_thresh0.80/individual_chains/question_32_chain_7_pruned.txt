Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and in this case, the nucleus is lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium typically has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6 isotope, right?

The question is asking for the energy such that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Okay, so relativistic speeds. I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is different from classical because at high speeds, you can't ignore relativistic effects.

So, first, I should find the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron, I think. So the total rest mass would be (3 + 3) * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that. 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but wait, actually, the mass of the nucleus isn't just the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh, but maybe for this problem, they just approximate it as the sum. Or perhaps they give the mass. Hmm, the question doesn't specify, so I'll go with the sum for now. So m = 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV/c².

Wait, but I've heard that the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum because of the mass defect due to binding energy. But I'm not sure if that's required here. Maybe the problem expects me to use the sum, so I'll proceed with m = 5.628 GeV/c².

Next, the speed is 0.96c. I need to find the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m * c². Since m is in GeV/c², when I multiply by c², the GeV comes out. So E = gamma * m. So m is 5.628 GeV/c², so E = 3
