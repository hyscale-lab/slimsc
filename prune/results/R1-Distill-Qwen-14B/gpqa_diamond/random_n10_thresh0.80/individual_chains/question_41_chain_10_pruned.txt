Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through different media, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving too. How does that affect the speed relative to an observer?

So, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking about the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. I think this is a problem involving relative motion and maybe the addition of velocities, but I'm not sure if it's relativistic or just classical.

In my notes, I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. So if the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the medium is c/n, perhaps I just add them? But wait, light's speed in the medium is c/n, but wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, no, because light speed in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as v_observed = (v + c/n), but wait, that doesn't seem right.
