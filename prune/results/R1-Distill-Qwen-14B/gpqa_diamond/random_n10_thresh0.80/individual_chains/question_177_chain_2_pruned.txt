Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers looked at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same for both. Additionally, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 when considering they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength emitted by a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's important.

Wait, but Star_1 is moving with a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift for it. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. That could affect the observed wavelength if we're looking at their spectra, but wait, the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, but maybe the brightness maximum is measured in the rest frame of the star. Because if we're observing the wavelength where they emit most, perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't come into play here. Or perhaps the Doppler effect is accounted for in their observed wavelength. Hmm, I'm a bit confused on that point.

Wait, let me think. The problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. So if one star is moving towards or away, the peak wavelength we observe would shift. But the problem doesn't say anything about the observed wavelengths being the same; it says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So, does that mean in their rest frames? Because if Star_2 is moving, its actual emission peak would be different. Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same for both, implying that the Doppler shifts have adjusted the λ_max to be the same. Or perhaps the problem is saying that the stars' intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So I think that the observed wavelengths are the same. So we have to account for any Doppler shifts.

Wait, but let me clarify. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. The Doppler effect would shift the wavelength. So the observed λ_max would be different from the rest frame λ_max. So if the observed λ_max is the same for both, that would imply that any Doppler shift has been taken into account, so their intrinsic λ_max would actually be different. But wait, the problem says that their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. Then, that would mean that (T1_obs) and (T2_obs) are the same, because λ_max is the same. But wait, if both have same observed λ_max, but Star_2 is moving, then their actual temperatures would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the rest frame λ_max are the same. So the stars' intrinsic peak wavelengths are same, so T1 = T2. But then why is the radial velocity given? Because that would affect
