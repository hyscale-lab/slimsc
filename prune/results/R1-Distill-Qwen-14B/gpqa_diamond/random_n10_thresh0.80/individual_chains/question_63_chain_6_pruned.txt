Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about a diatomic molecule and it involves the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy when a photon is absorbed. I'm supposed to find the momentum of that photon. Let me break down the information given.

The molecule is made of X and Y. Their masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are for the photon's momentum p.

Wait, the fundamental state is the state of lowest energy. In a diatomic molecule's rotation-vibration model, the states are quantized. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But the question uses the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the rotation-vibration model where the bond can stretch a bit, so it's more like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator combined with rotation.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The non-rigid rotor model, also known as the rotation-vibration model, typically considers the vibrational energy levels as well as rotational. So the total energy would have contributions from both rotation and vibration.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy. So the molecule is in the ground state, which has the lowest vibrational and rotational energies. But when a photon is absorbed, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next higher state, probably the first excited state, but I'm not sure if that's vibrational or rotational.

Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So among the higher states, the one with the lowest energy would be the next one beyond the ground state. Let me think about the energy levels. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized in both vibration and rotation. The total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational parts.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_v = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number (J=0,1,2,...) and B is the rotational constant.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 and J=0. So the molecule is in E = (0 + ½) h w + (0)(0+1) B. So E = (½ h w) + 0 = ½ h w.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. To get the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would be the next possible state in either vibration or rotation.

Wait, the next state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (J=1, n=0). We need to determine which transition requires less energy, because the photon's momentum is related to the energy it provides.

So I need to find the energy required for each possible transition and then compare them. The photon's energy should match the energy difference between the initial state and the next state.

First, let's calculate the energy required for the vibration transition: from n=0 to n=1. The energy difference ΔE_vib = E(n=1) - E(n=0) = [ (1 + ½) h w ] - [ (0 + ½) h w ] = (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

Now, the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = B*(2 - 0) = 2 B.

So which of these is smaller? Because the photon with the lower energy (smaller momentum, since p= h/λ and E=pc) would be the one needed for the lower energy transition.

Wait, but photons with higher energy have higher frequency, which relates to higher momentum. So wait, the molecule's next state is the one with the lowest possible energy, so the photon should provide the least possible energy to get the molecule into the next state.

So which transition requires less energy: vibrational or rotational?

Hmm, I need to calculate both and see which is smaller.

Let me calculate B, the rotational constant. B is given by h/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.

Wait, μ is the reduced mass: μ = (M_x * M_y) / (M_x + M_y).

Given Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute exact:

1.818 *1.6605= approximately 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Then, B = h/(8 π² μ R²). R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Plugging the numbers in:

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / [8 * π² * μ * R² ]

Calculating denominator:

8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So denominator = 78.957 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.957 * 1.2064 = approx 95.26, so 95.26e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (95.26e-46) = 6.626e-34 / 9.526e-45.

Wait, 95.26e-46 is 9.526e-45.

So 6.626e-34 /9.526e-45 = (6.626 /9.526 ) * 1e11 ≈ (0.695) * 1e11 ≈ 6.95e10 1/(s).

Wait, 6.626e-34 divided by 9.526e-45 is 6.626 /9.526 = approx 0.695, and 1e(-34 +45) = 1e11. So 0.695e11 1/s which is 6.95e10 rad/s.

So B is approximately 6.95e10 rad/s.

Wait, but the vibrational frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the rotational constant B is about 6.95e10 rad/s, which is much lower than the vibrational frequency.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B = 2 *6.95e10 = 1.39e11 rad/s.

Wait, no, wait. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is a change of ΔE_rot = 2 B.

But B is in units of energy per rotational level? Or in units of frequency? Wait, B has units of rad/s because it's derived from h/(8 pi² mu R²), which is [J s]/(kg m²) ) → kg m²/s² * s → (kg m²/s²) * s → (J) * s? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy.

Wait, no. B is in units of frequency because it's h/(something that has units of action) → since h is in J s, and the denominator is in J s, so B is in 1/s → rad/s.

So E_rot = B J (J+1) → but actually, E_rot should be in joules. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are calculated as E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So in terms of B, which is h/(8 pi² I), so B is in 1/s.

So E_rot = B h J (J+1) / (2 pi) ? Hmm this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the energy differences in terms of Joules and compare.

Wait, maybe I
