Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Hmm, the structure looks a bit off. Oh wait, maybe it's supposed to be something like L = λ f f(y) [ῡψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)], but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction term. In any case, the key point is that the boson X interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

So, kinematically allowed decays depend on two main factors: the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into. At lowest order, the decay would be into a pair of fermions, like X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

The possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. So, I need to determine which fermions have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV, because the mass of X is 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be possible, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses. Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their antiparticles.

But wait, the masses of the fermions are important here. Let me think about their masses:

- Up quark: about 2 MeV (current algebra gives around 2.2 MeV, but sometimes considered as up to 5 MeV depending on model)
- Down quark: similar to up, maybe around 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: around 100 MeV (but can vary)
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
