Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

First, let me read the question carefully. The question describes a series of three reactions, all of which are Michael additions. Each reaction has two reactants and produces a product (A, B, C respectively). Then, there are four options given, each with different structures for A, B, and C. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Let me break down each reaction one by one. 

The first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH) gives product A.

Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (enolate) on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually a strong base, like an enolate, which attacks the beta position of the acceptor.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good enolate donor. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, right? So, when treated with a base like NaOEt, it should deprotonate to form the enolate ion. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. So, when deprotonated, the enolate would be at the alpha position, which is the central carbon.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl, which is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring at the para position. So actually, it's probably more like CH2=CH-C( p-tolyl )-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group at the third position, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: in acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the carbonyl is at carbon 3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group substituting the carbonyl carbon?

Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So "3-(p-tolyl)acrylate" would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon. But the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is probably not possible. Maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent on the double bond.

Wait, no, E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl. Hmm, that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond
