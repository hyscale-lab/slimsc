Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I need to figure out the right answers. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This creates a new carbon-carbon bond. The reaction typically occurs between a nucleophile (like an enolate) and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor).

Looking at the question, there are three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each has different reactants and conditions, and I need to find the products based on the options given.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ A**

Hmm, so the nucleophile here is from dimethyl malonate. Wait, malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. When NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) is used in EtOH, it's a base that deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate. So the enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, wait, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait: the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the substituent is on the CH2 group. So it's (p-tolyl)CH2-CH2COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Acrylate is propenoate, which is CH2=CHCOO-. The substituent is at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps I should visualize it. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the third carbon is the COO group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, the numbering would be such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So if it's 3-(
