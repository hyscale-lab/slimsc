Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals belong to a specific type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, right? But in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the diagonals, but all sides are equal. So the a, b, c lattice parameters must all be the same, but the angles are all 30 degrees here.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The (111) plane is one of the family of planes where each Miller index is 1, so that's the first plane in that set.

I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by d = a/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + ... wait, no, wait, I think that's for other crystal systems. Wait, no, I think the general formula is d = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos β + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos αβ ))), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Or perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the unit cell and vectors.

Wait, for a cubic system, it's easy: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees, so the formula changes. So the formula for d for a general crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (1/√( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) ) * (1/a)

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are equal, so α = β = γ. And the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal as well. So if a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = θ, then the formula should simplify.

Alternatively, I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = (a^2 (b^2 + c^2 - a^2 cos^2 α ... no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the formula in my notes. Oh wait, I can't do that right now, but I'll try to think.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d can be calculated using the formula d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) )

But in this case, since in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, and a = b = c = a0 = 10 Angstroms here (since the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, I think that's a0, the lattice parameter). Wait wait, no, in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is a0. But in a rhombohedral system, if all edges are a, then the interatomic distance is a. So yes, a = 10 Angstrom.

Given that, and the angles α = β = γ = 30 degrees, which is 30°, so cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α )

But since α=β=γ=30°, it becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk*(√3/2) - 2hl*(√3/2) - 2kl*(√3/2) )

Simplify that:

= a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (hk + hl + kl)√3 )

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Plug in the values:

d = 10 / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * (√3) )

Let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, 1+1+1 =3.

Then, the terms inside the parentheses: (1*1 +1*1 +1*1)=3. Multiply by √3, gives 3√3.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3√3).

Wait, wait, wait. 3 - 3√3 is a negative number because √3 is about 1.732, so 3√3≈5.196. So 3 -5.196≈-2.196. Oh wait, that's a problem because you can't take the square root of a negative number. That can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Ah, perhaps I got the signs wrong. Maybe the formula has minus terms, but in reality, since the angles are less than 90 degrees, the cross terms might be positive.
