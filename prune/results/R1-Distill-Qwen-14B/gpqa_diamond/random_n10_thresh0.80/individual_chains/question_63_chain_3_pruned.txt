Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, elements X and Y. It's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D with various momentum values.

Hmm. I remember that in the quantum mechanical models for diatomic molecules, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that refers to the next possible state, which would be the first excited state. But since the molecule can change either rotational or vibrational states, I need to think about the selection rules. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that implies it's the next higher energy state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the ground state, so the next state would involve either a vibrational or rotational transition. But since the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, perhaps it's the lowest possible energy change, which would be the first vibrational state, or the first rotational state, whichever is lower.

But wait, the energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, it's E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ω. So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next possible state could either be n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational), but which has lower energy?

Let me calculate the energies for each transition. The energy difference for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE_vib =
