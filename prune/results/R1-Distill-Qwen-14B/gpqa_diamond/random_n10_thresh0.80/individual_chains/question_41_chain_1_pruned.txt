Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. Okay, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Hmm, how does that affect things?

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, speed of light in a medium usually is c/n. Oh, right, because in vacuum it's c, and in the medium, it's slower. So normally, in the glass, the speed would be c divided by n, which is 1/n since c is given as 1. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this is a problem involving relative motion. I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, but wait, is that necessary here? Because the velocity v is probably non-relativistic, but the question doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe it's intended to use Galilean addition because it's a simpler problem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options given don't look like they involve any square roots or other relativistic terms. They all are linear in v. So perhaps we're to use the Galilean transformation for velocity addition.

Okay, Galilean addition says that if an object is moving
