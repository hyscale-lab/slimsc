Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and I have to choose the correct expression from the options given.

Wait, so I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? And the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is relativistic, so things are different.

Relativistic mechanics comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So we can't use the classical expressions directly. Instead, we need to use the relativistic expressions for energy.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since this is a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but maybe the problem is treating it classically. So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the total mechanical energy.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the kinetic energy (K) is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA². At maximum speed (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So setting E equal in both cases.

Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at x=A, so the kinetic energy is zero there. At x=0, the potential is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², and at x=0, the kinetic energy is E = (γ-1)mc².

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ -1)mc².

Solving for γ: γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so let's write:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm. Let me rearrange this. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let's call it α for simplification. So α = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

So, 1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2α + α².

Take reciprocal of both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + 2α + α²).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I should express v in terms of α.

Let me approach it step by step.

From γ = 1 + α, where α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Hmm. Hmm, let's compute this expression.

Let me denote β = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So, the equation becomes:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + β)^2.

Compute 1/(1+β)^2: 1/(1+2β + β²) = [1/(1+β)]^2.

Wait, so 1 - 1/(1+β)^2 = [ (1+β)^2 - 1 ] / (1+β)^2.

So numerator: (1 + 2β + β² - 1 ) = 2β + β^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2.

Factor numerator: β(2 + β).

Denominator: (1 + β)^2.

Hmm, so v = c * sqrt( [ β(2 + β) ] / (1 + β)^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

β(2 + β) = β (beta + 2) = β ( (beta +1 ) + 1 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor it differently.

Wait, [β(2 + β)] = β (beta +2) = beta^2 + 2β.

Denominator is (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta².

Hmm. Alternatively, express the fraction as [beta (beta + 2)] / (beta + 1)^2.

Wait,
