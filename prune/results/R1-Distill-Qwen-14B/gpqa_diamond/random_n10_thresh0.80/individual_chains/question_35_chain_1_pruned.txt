Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me an operator Ay which is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators in spin systems are often represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by some constants. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. For example, σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which looks exactly like the matrix S given here. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay = c * σy. And since c is h/(4π), I need to figure out the eigenvalues of Ay. Eigenvalues come from solving the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for each component. Wait, but wait—what's the relation here? Because the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1/2. Because σy has eigenvalues ±1/2. So when you multiply σy by a constant, the eigenvalues get multiplied by that constant.

Wait, let's think. If the matrix Ay is c times σy, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of σy. So σy has eigenvalues ±1/2, so Ay's eigenvalues would be c*(±1/2).

Given that c is h/(4π), plugging that in: (h/(4π)) * (1/2) = h/(8π), and the other eigenvalue would be -h/(8π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to have this value. Hmm. Or did I get something wrong?

Wait, maybe I should re-express S as σy. Let me recheck: S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed σy. And the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±½. So, the eigenvalues for Ay would be c multiplied by ±½. So, c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are [h/(4π)]*(1/2) = h/(8π) and -h/(8π). But looking at the options, none of them directly show these values. Hmm. That's confusing.

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh, wait—the problem says that Ay is a 2×2 matrix, and the options are about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me look at the options.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our calculation suggests the eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because σy has real eigenvalues ±1/2 when multiplied by c. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, σy is a matrix with complex entries, but its eigenvalues are real. Because σy is Hermitian. Because
