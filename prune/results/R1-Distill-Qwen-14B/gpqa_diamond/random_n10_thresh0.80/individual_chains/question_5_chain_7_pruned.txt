Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a spin operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I remember that spin-½ particles have their operators represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The direction here is along a vector n lying in the x-z plane.

The operator P is given for each component: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. So, the general form for the operator along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y should be zero. So, the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me denote the direction by an angle, maybe θ from the z-axis. Then, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or maybe π/2? No, in x-z plane, the direction is defined by polar angles where φ is 0 or π, depending on x positive or negative. But the problem says an arbitrary direction, so I can just express it in terms of θ and n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So the operator P becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

That matrix would be (ħ/2) times:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, is that right? Let me compute:

P = n_x Px + n_z Pz = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0 1],[1 0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2)[[1 0],[0 -1]]

So, each term:

First term (sinθ * (ħ/2)):
0   sinθ*(ħ/2)
sinθ*(ħ/2)  0

Second term (cosθ * (ħ/2)):
cosθ*(ħ/2)   0
0   -cosθ*(ħ/2)

Adding them together:

[ cosθ*(ħ/2), sinθ*(ħ/2) ]
[ sinθ*(ħ/2), -cosθ*(ħ/2) ]

Yes, that looks right.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Wait, no, the operator P is the spin component along n. So, the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2. So, the eigenvector we're looking for is the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So to find the eigenvector, we set up the equation (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Let me write the matrix P:

P = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
            [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Then, P - (ħ/2) I would be:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Wait, no: (ħ/2) I would subtract (ħ/2) from the diagonal elements.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ ( (ħ/2)(cosθ) - ħ/2 ) , (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ ), ( (ħ/2)(-cosθ) - ħ/2 ) ]

Which can be written as:

[ ħ/2 (cosθ -1) , ħ/2 sinθ ]
[ ħ/2 sinθ, ħ/2 (-cosθ -1) ]

Hmm, maybe factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ -
