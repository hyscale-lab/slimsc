Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

The options are A to D, with various concentrations. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of that complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is present at 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think EDTA is usually in a 1:1 ratio with metal ions), the dissociation would be Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

But wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is usually written as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, the K given is K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. So that's the formation constant. So if we have a solution where the complex is formed, most of the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low, right?

The solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. Let's say that some of this complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x would be very small compared to 0.02, because K is so large)

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

So plugging in:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)  
5e10 = 0.02 / x²  
So x² = 0.02 / (5e10)  
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10  
Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e
