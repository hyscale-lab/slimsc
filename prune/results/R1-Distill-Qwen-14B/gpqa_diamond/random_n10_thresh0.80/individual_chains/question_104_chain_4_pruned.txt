Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. The formula for K, I think, is K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) )... No, maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, I think the formula might relate to the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter.

Another approach: The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity the star moves. The velocity K is connected to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, right?

I recall that the formula for K is K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ... Wait, maybe I should think more in terms of the Doppler formula.

Alternatively, the formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) ... No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another thought: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends
