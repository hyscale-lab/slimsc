Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. Hmm. It says that the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH and temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The complex has a high stability, which is why the formation constant K is so large here.

So the problem is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the formula for this complex is CaEDTA^2-, because each EDTA^4- binds with a Ca^2+ ion. So the formula would be CaY^2- (where Y is EDTA^4-).

The formation constant, K, is given. The formation constant for the complex is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So K is a very large number, which means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions should be low.

Wait, but how do I relate the concentration of the complex to the free ions? The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

But in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But because K is so big, the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be very small.

Let me think about the equation. The complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in this solution, the initial concentration of EDTA^4- might not be zero. Because the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces EDTA^4-. Wait a minute, perhaps I should consider the initial concentrations.

Wait, wait. The
