Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, I'll need to break this down step by step. Let's see what each of the given data tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have even broader and stronger peaks, right? Or maybe a carbonyl group? No, the carbonyl is usually around 1700. Oh wait, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are probably carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester, and 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or maybe an amide, but amides usually have lower wavenumbers. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, since there are multiple peaks in the NMR, the structure might have some substitution or branching.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what fragments give m/z 45. Common ones are like the CH3OH (32), or maybe a CO (28) plus something. Wait, 45 could be a ketene group, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO+ would be 43, but wait, 45 is a bit higher. Or maybe it's a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is 58, no. Wait, another option: 45 could be a fragment with a carbonyl group. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let me calculate their degrees of unsaturation to see what structures are possible.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 degree. So either a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But given that the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, so this would account for one, and the other could be a ring or another double bond.

But wait, the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks, which are double bonds (C=O). So that's two double bonds. But that would mean two degrees of unsaturation. Hmm, but according to the calculation for option A, degrees are 1, which doesn't add up. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate. For option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So only one degree. But we have two C=O groups from the IR? That would imply two double bonds, which would require two degrees. So maybe that's a problem. Unless one of the carbonyls is part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are conjugated. Or maybe one is a ketone and another is an ester, but that would require more oxygen. Wait, let me look at the other options.

Option B: C6H10O. C=6, H=10, O=1.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees of
