Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). From what I remember, the interaction term tells us what particles the boson X can decay into. The boson's mass is 6 GeV, so I need to determine which fermions it can decay into based on their masses.

Wait, the Lagrangian here involves the fermion fields ψ_f. So the interaction is with fermions, and X is a boson coupling to these fermions. The general decay process would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. For this to happen, the mass of the boson X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f, because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent particle must be equal to or greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.

So, the first thing I need to do is list all the possible fermions f that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Wait, wait, no, because the mass of the boson is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV each, but in reality, because when X decays into f and f̄, each would have a mass of up to 3 GeV. So, any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Now, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me recall:

- Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): about 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the top quark is way above 3 GeV, so it's out. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b quarks either because each b would be 4.5 GeV, and 2*4.5 is 9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So, no b or t quarks here.

So let's list the fermions that have mass ≤ 3 GeV:

Looking at each:

- e⁻: yes
- μ⁻: yes
- τ⁻: yes (since 1.777 is <3)
- u: yes
- d: yes
- s: yes (0.095 GeV)
- c: 1.5 GeV, yes
- b: no
- t: no.

So possible fermions are e, μ, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait again. The tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2 * 1.777 is about 3.554 GeV. But X's mass is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.554 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

Now, the possible decay products are pairs of these fermions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. Wait, but earlier we saw that b's mass is 4.5 GeV, which is heavier than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b's. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So includes c, which has a mass of 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is okay because X is 6 GeV. So yes, c can be in the decay. So option B includes c, but does X decay to c?

Wait, the interaction term is for each fermion f; the Lagrangian has f and ψ_f. So each f is a type of fermion that this boson X can interact with. So the allowed decays are any fermion f that has mass ≤ 3 GeV. So c is allowed.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau, mu, e. Wait, t is way too heavy, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, includes b which is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options list the possible decay channels. So the correct option should include all possible fermions with mass ≤3 GeV, but not include heavier ones.

So, looking back, the correct fermion pairs are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, and c.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed fermions except for the heavier ones.

Option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, the interaction term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is for each fermion f, so X can decay into any f and f̄ pair where the mass is allowed. So the allowed fermion types are all those with mass ≤3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options, which option includes all of these except the heavier ones?

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except the excluded. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other constraints? Like, are there any other factors that might affect the decay? For example, color charge. The X is a boson, and if it's a gauge boson, like the W or Z, then the decay products have to consider their color. But wait, the problem says it's a bosonic field; I'm not told whether it's a gauge boson or a scalar. But considering the given Lagrangian, it's a Yukawa-like interaction, so the X is a scalar. So for fermions that are colored, like quarks, the decay would require creation of quark-antiquark pairs.

But regardless, as long as the mass is sufficient, the decay is possible. So the color shouldn't affect the possibility unless the X is a color-charged particle, but I don't think that's the case here.

So, the allowed decays are into any fermion pair where each has mass ≤3 GeV. So the possible decays are:

X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

So the correct option would include all these, except the heavier fermions.

Looking back, option B is X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones.

Option B is the correct one.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L} = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \). 

The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the fermion mass limit for decays is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). The masses of known fermions are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Thus, the allowed fermion pairs for \( X \) decays are \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is excluded because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is excluded because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is excluded. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
