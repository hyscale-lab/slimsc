Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector gives me back the same vector scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is probably a spin operator since we're dealing with eigenvalues like ±ħ/2. Oh right, spin-½ particles have spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So maybe P here is similar to the spin operator. The components Px, Py, Pz are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices. For Px, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, Px = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator P along direction n would be P = nx Px + nz Pz, right? Because for a vector operator, the operator in direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding unit vector component.

Wait, but the operator is along n, so I think the operator should be P = nx Px + nz Pz + ny Py. Oh wait, but n is in the x-z plane, so ny must be zero. So, P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. So, nx and nz can be expressed in terms of an angle θ perhaps. Let me think, maybe nx = cosθ and nz = sinθ, or the other way around, depending on how the direction is defined. Let's say θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ). So, P = cosθ * Px + sinθ * Pz.

Alternatively, wait, sometimes angles are measured from the x-axis, but regardless, I'll proceed with this parametrization.

So, the operator P is given by:

P = cosθ (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying out the matrices:

The (1,1) element is sinθ * 1, because it's 0 from the first matrix and 1*sinθ from the second. The (1,2) element is cosθ * 1. Similarly, (2,1) is cosθ * 1, and (2,2) is - sinθ.

So,

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
               [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

Hmm, wait no. Let me recompute. The first matrix (from Px) is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the second (from Pz) is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we add them after scaling by cosθ and sinθ respectively:

Each term is:

cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0]]
sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[sinθ, 0], [0, -sinθ]]

Adding them together:

[[ sinθ, cosθ ],
 [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

So, yes, that's correct. So P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, let's write the matrix form of P: P = (ħ/2) * M, where M is the matrix above. So,

P = (ħ/2) * M = (ħ/2) * [ [ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>, so subtract (ħ/2) I from both sides:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2)(M - I) = 0

So the matrix becomes (M - I) multiplied by (ħ/2). Wait, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, perhaps it's better to set up the equation:

(P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0

Which becomes:

(ħ/2) (M - I) |v> = 0

But since ħ/2 is a scalar, it's equivalent to:

(M - I) |v> = 0

So, let's compute M - I. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So,

M - I = [ [ sinθ - 1, cosθ ],
           [ cosθ, -sinθ - 1 ] ]

Wait, let me double-check:

M is [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
        [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

So, M - I = [ [ sinθ -1, cosθ ],
              [ cosθ, -sinθ -1 ] ]

Now, for the matrix (M - I), the determinant should be zero because it has non-trivial solutions.

Wait, the determinant of (M - I) is (sinθ -1)(-sinθ -1) - (cosθ)^2.

Let me compute that:

= [ (sinθ -1)(-sinθ -1) ) ] - cos²θ
= [ (-sinθ)(sinθ -1) -1*(sinθ -1) ) ] - cos²θ
Wait, maybe it's easier to multiply it out:

(sinθ - 1)(-sinθ -1) = (-sin²θ - sinθ + sinθ +1 ) = (-sin²θ + 1 )

Then subtract cos²θ:

= (-sin²θ +1) - cos²θ
= [1 - sin²θ] - cos²θ
= [cos²θ] - cos²θ = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because the matrix is singular, so there are non-trivial solutions.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can set up the equations from (M - I) |v> = 0.

Let the eigenvector be v = [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0
cosθ a + (-sinθ -1) b = 0

Let me take the first equation:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0 → [ (1 - sinθ) a ] = cosθ b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b.

Wait, because (sinθ -1) is -(1 - sinθ), so moving the terms:

(1 - sinθ) a = cosθ b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b.

Alternatively, we can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ) to rationalize.

So, [ cosθ * (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / (1 - sin²θ) )

But 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ, so denominator is cos²θ.

So, a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] / cos²θ * b → a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b.

So, a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b.

Hmm, can I write (1 + sinθ)/cosθ as [1/cosθ + sinθ/cosθ ] which is secθ + tanθ? Not sure if that helps, but perhaps I can express this in terms of tangent or some other function.

Alternatively, I can express it as:

a = [ (1 + sinθ) ] / cosθ * b.

Let me consider the ratio a/b. So,

a/b = (1 + sinθ) / cosθ = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write this in terms of tan(θ/2). Let me recall that 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 + π/4)^2 or something like that. Alternatively, I can use substitution.

Alternatively, let me set t = θ/2. Then, sinθ = 2 sin t cos t, and cosθ = cos²t - sin²t. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the identities:

1 + sinθ = 2 sin(t + π/4)^2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can write (1 + sinθ)/cosθ as tan(π/4 + θ/2). Let me think: tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB)/(1 - tanA tanB). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute (1 + sinθ)/cosθ. If I multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sinθ), I get:

[ (1 + sinθ) (1 - sinθ) ] / [ cosθ (1 - sinθ) ) ] = [1 - sin²θ ] / [ cosθ (1 - sinθ) ) ] = [cos²θ ] / [ cosθ (1 - sinθ) ) ] = cosθ / (1 - sinθ )

Wait that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, I can note that (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).

Wait, yes! Because:

tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB)/(1 - tanA tanB )

Let me compute tan(π/4 + θ/2):

= [ tan(π/4) + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(π/4) tan(θ/2) ]

= [ 1 + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(θ/2) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by cos(θ/2):

= [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ]:

Denominator becomes [ cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2) ) ] = cosθ.

Numerator becomes [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ]² = cos²(θ/2) + 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) = 1 + sinθ.

So the entire expression becomes [1 + sinθ ] / cosθ, which is exactly (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

So, (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).

So, a/b = tan(π/4 + θ/2).

Which means, a = b tan(π/4 + θ/2).

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of sine and cosine of θ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: Let me set the eigenvector components as a and b. From the first equation, a = [ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ ] b.

So, let me let b = cosθ, then a = (1 + sinθ). Wait, but that would make the eigenvector [1 + sinθ, cosθ]^T. But wait, let me check.

If a = (1 + sinθ) and b = cosθ, then substituting into (M - I) |v> = 0.

First equation: (sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = (sinθ -1)(1 + sinθ) + cosθ * cosθ.

= ( sinθ (1 + sinθ) - 1*(1 + sinθ) ) + cos²θ.

= [ sinθ + sin²θ -1 - sinθ ] + cos²θ.

= (sin²θ -1 ) + cos²θ.

= ( sin²θ + cos²θ ) -1 = (1) -1 = 0. So that works.

Second equation: cosθ a + (-sinθ -1) b = cosθ (1 + sinθ) + (-sinθ -1) cosθ.

= cosθ + sinθ cosθ - sinθ cosθ - cosθ.

= 0. So yes, this works. So the eigenvector can be taken as [1 + sinθ, cosθ]^T. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because when I set b=cosθ, and a=(1 + sinθ), but let me think about the dimensionality.

Wait, actually, the ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ, so any scalar multiple would also satisfy this ratio. So, the eigenvector can be written as [1 + sinθ, cosθ]^T, but perhaps it's more convenient to normalize it.

Wait, but perhaps I can write this in terms of exponential forms, considering that quantum states are often represented using complex numbers, so maybe b has an imaginary component? Wait, but in this problem, the eigenvector is real. Because the operator P is real. Hmm, but wait, the given options include complex terms, so maybe I need to consider that.

Wait, but in this problem, when I set up the equations, I didn't encounter any imaginary terms because the operator P for a real direction n (in x-z) would have real matrix elements, so the eigenvectors would be real, I think. So, perhaps the components are real.

But looking at the options, some have complex components, but perhaps the direction is along x-z, so the eigenvector is real. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, but let's think about the normalized eigenvector. The components I found are [1 + sinθ, cosθ]. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is (1 + sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 = 1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ = (sin² + cos²) is 1, so 1 + 2 sinθ + 1 = 2 + 2 sinθ = 2(1 + sinθ).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (1 + sinθ)/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)), cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]^T.

Simplify each component:

(1 + sinθ)/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 )

Similarly, cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) = sqrt( cosθ^2 / (2(1 + sinθ)) )

Wait, but perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this. Let me think.

I recall that (1 + sinθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2 + π/4) or something similar. Alternatively, using the identity 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 + π/4)^2, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, let me consider using the substitution t = θ/2. So θ = 2t.

Then, 1 + sinθ = 1 + 2 sin t cos t = (sin t + cos t)^2 = [sqrt(2) sin(t + π/4)]^2.

So, sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) = sin(t + π/4) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sin(t + π/4).

Wait, more accurately, sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) = sin(t + π/4 ), because:

(1 + sinθ)/2 = [1 + 2 sin t cos t ] / 2 = [ (sin t + cos t)^2 ] / 2.

So sqrt( (sin t + cos t)^2 / 2 ) = (sin t + cos t)/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2)/2 (sin t + cos t) ) = sin(t + π/4).

Because sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So sin(t + π/4) = sin t cos(π/4) + cos t sin(π/4) = (sin t + cos t)/sqrt(2). So that leads to sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) = sin(t + π/4) where t=θ/2.

Similarly, cosθ = cos(2t) = 1 - 2 sin²t. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's compute the second component:

cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) = [cosθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [cosθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) = [ cosθ * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ] / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ)) ) = [ cosθ sqrt(1 - sinθ) ] / sqrt(2(1 - sin²θ)) )

But 1 - sin²θ is cos²θ, so sqrt(2(1 - sin²θ)) )= sqrt(2 cos²θ) )= sqrt(2) |cosθ|.

Assuming cosθ is positive (which it is for θ between -π/2 and π/2), this becomes sqrt(2) cosθ.

So,

[ cosθ * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ] / ( sqrt(2) cosθ ) ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ).

But 1 - sinθ = 2 cos²(t + π/4), where t=θ/2. Alternatively,

(1 - sinθ)/2 = [1 - sin(2t)]/2 = [ (cos t - sin t)^2 ] / 2. So sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) = (cos t - sin t)/sqrt(2) ) = cos(t + π/4).

So, putting it all together, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

Which can be written as [ sin(t + π/4), cos(t + π/4) ) ] where t=θ/2.

Alternatively, since θ is the angle in the x-z plane, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of some other angle, like the polar angle in spherical coordinates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the eigenvector in terms of direction. If the operator is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane, the eigenstates would correspond to spin up or down along that direction.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates for spin along a direction can be expressed using spherical harmonics or in terms of the angles θ and φ. However, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So, the state can be written as a combination of |+x> and |+z> states.

Wait, for a spin-½ particle, the eigenstates of S·n are:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |+x> 

But wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the eigenstates are:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |+x>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0. So,

|+> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |+x>

Wait, but |+x> is (1,0), and |+z> is (0,1) if I'm using the standard basis where spin-up along z is (0,1).

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the basis. Let me correct this.

In the standard basis, S_z has eigenstates |+z> = [0, 1]^T and |−z> = [1, 0]^T.

Similarly, S_x has eigenstates |+x> = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T and |−x> = [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So, the eigenstate for S·n when n is in the x-z plane (phi=0) would be:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + sin(theta/2) |+x>

Wait, that would be [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute it. The eigenstate when the direction is along (theta, phi=0) would be e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, but since phi=0, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. Wait, but I thought phi is the azimuthal angle, so when n is in x-z plane, phi=0, then the state is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T? Or is it the other way?

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the eigenstates for spin in direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

|-> = e^{-i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

So for phi=0, this becomes:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

|-> = [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, but in our problem, the eigenvector we found earlier was [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]^T. Let me compare this to the expression from the spin state.

Wait, the first component of |+> is cos(theta/2), which is sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ). Because cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ).

Wait, cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ), and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ). Hmm, but in our eigenvector, the components are sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ). So, perhaps not the same as the standard |+> state.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Alternatively, perhaps I need to think in terms of the operator P being in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is measured from the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of theta/2.

So, if the eigenvector is [ a, b ]^T, then a = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), b = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Alternatively, I can express this as [ cos(alpha), sin(alpha) ]^T, where alpha is some angle.

Wait, perhaps I can write sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) as cos(alpha) and sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) as sin(alpha).

Let me square both:

cos²(alpha) = (1 + sinθ)/2 → 2 cos²(alpha) = 1 + sinθ → 2 cos²(alpha) -1 = sinθ → cos(2 alpha) = sinθ.

Hmm, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find alpha such that:

tan(alpha) = [ sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ] / [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) ] = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/(1 + sinθ) )

Which is the same as sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/(1 + sinθ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator inside the sqrt by (1 - sinθ):

= sqrt( (1 - sinθ)^2 / (1 - sin²θ) ) ) = (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

So, tan(alpha) = (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

Hmm, considering that, perhaps alpha is (pi/4 - theta/2), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's compute:

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = [1 - sinθ]/cosθ.

This can be written as [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Wait, earlier, I found that (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan(pi/4 + theta/2).

Similarly, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ = tan(pi/4 - theta/2).

Because:

tan(pi/4 - theta/2) = [ tan(pi/4) - tan(theta/2) ] / [ 1 + tan(pi/4) tan(theta/2) ]

= [1 - tan(theta/2)] / [1 + tan(theta/2)]

Multiply numerator and denominator by cos(theta/2):

= [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ]:

Denominator becomes cos²(theta/2) - sin²(theta/2) = cos(theta).

Numerator becomes [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ]^2 = cos²(theta/2) - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1 - sin(theta).

So, [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))^2 ] / cos(theta) ) = (1 - sin(theta)) / cos(theta).

Thus, tan(pi/4 - theta/2) = (1 - sin theta)/cos theta.

So, alpha = pi/4 - theta/2.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(alpha), sin(alpha) ] where alpha = pi/4 - theta/2.

But looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the standard spin-up state along direction theta, phi=0.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, the eigenvector components are [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should plug in some specific angles to see what's happening.

Let me take theta = 0 degrees. Then, the direction is along the z-axis.

So, the operator P along z would be (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the state |+z> = [0,1]^T.

In this case, our formula from the eigenvector would be:

sqrt( (1 + 0)/2 )= sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2),
sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )= 1/sqrt(2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T, which is along the x-axis, not z-axis. That doesn't make sense. Wait, but when theta is zero, the direction is along z, so the eigenvector should be |+z>, which is [0,1]^T. But according to our formula, it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T, which is |+x>, which has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for Sx. So, there must be a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I messed up the setup somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, earlier, when I set up the operator P in the direction n = (nx, 0, nz), I considered P = nx Px + nz Pz. But perhaps I should have included the normalization factor, since n is a unit vector.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S·n is S·n = nx Sx + ny Sy + nz Sz, where n is a unit vector. So, in our case, n is in x-z plane, so ny=0, and n = (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² = 1.

So, the correct expression for P is P = n · (Px, 0, Pz) = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but earlier, I didn't include the normalization factor. So, perhaps I should have used (nx, nz) as components of a unit vector. So, the correct approach is to express P as:

P = (nx) Px + (nz) Pz,

where nx² + nz² = 1.

So, when theta is the angle from the z-axis, then nx = sin(theta), nz = cos(theta).

Wait, that's the standard convention. So, for example, when theta=0, the direction is along z, so nx=0, nz=1.

So, in that case, P would be 0 * Px + 1 * Pz = Pz.

So, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are |+z> = [0,1]^T and |−z> = [1,0]^T.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization of n. Let me correct that.

Let me redefine n as having components (sin theta, 0, cos theta), so that when theta=0, it's along z, and theta=pi/2 along x.

Then, P = sin theta Px + cos theta Pz.

So, let's recompute the matrix P.

Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

Pz is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P = (ħ/2) [ sin theta [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos theta [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which can be written as:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cos theta, sin theta ],
             [ sin theta, - cos theta ] ]

Wait, no. Let's compute each element:

The (1,1) element is cos theta * 1 (from Pz) plus 0 (from Px) → cos theta.

The (1,2) element is sin theta * 1 (from Px) → sin theta.

The (2,1) element is sin theta * 1 → sin theta.

The (2,2) element is cos theta * (-1) → - cos theta.

So, matrix P is (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cos theta, sin theta ],
  [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ]

Wait, now, finding the eigenvectors for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So,

(ħ/2) [ [ cos theta - 1, sin theta ],
         [ sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ] |v> = 0.

Which simplifies to:

[ [ cos theta - 1, sin theta ],
  [ sin theta, - (cos theta +1) ] ]

Multiply each element by ħ/2, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, the scaling factor doesn't affect the solution, so we can ignore it.

So, the matrix becomes:

M = [ [ cos theta -1, sin theta ],
       [ sin theta, - (cos theta +1) ] ]

The determinant should be zero, so let's compute it:

det(M) = (cos theta -1)(- (cos theta +1)) ) - (sin theta)^2.

= [ -(cos theta -1)(cos theta +1) ) ] - sin^2 theta.

= [ - (cos² theta -1) ) ] - sin^2 theta.

= [ -cos² theta +1 ] - sin² theta.

= (1 - cos² theta) - sin² theta.

= sin^2 theta - sin^2 theta = 0.

So, determinant is zero, which makes sense.

Now, writing the equations:

( cos theta -1 ) a + sin theta b = 0 → equation (1)

sin theta a - ( cos theta +1 ) b = 0 → equation (2)

Let me take equation (1):

( cos theta -1 ) a + sin theta b = 0 → (1 - cos theta) a = sin theta b → a = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ] b.

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos theta):

a = [ sin theta (1 + cos theta) ] / [ (1 - cos theta)(1 + cos theta) ) ] * b

Denominator is 1 - cos² theta = sin² theta.

So,

a = [ sin theta (1 + cos theta) ] / sin² theta * b → a = (1 + cos theta)/ sin theta * b.

Which is a = [ (1 + cos theta)/ sin theta ] b.

Hmm, (1 + cos theta)/ sin theta can be simplified. Let me write it as:

(1 + cos theta)/ sin theta = cot(theta/2).

Because, using the identity:

1 + cos theta = 2 cos²(theta/2),

sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

(1 + cos theta)/ sin theta = [2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So, a = cot(theta/2) b.

So, the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2).

Which means, a = cot(theta/2) b.

Let me choose b = sin(theta/2), then a = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, that's much simpler! So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, let me check the normalization. The norm is sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but in the case when theta is zero (so direction is along z), this gives the eigenvector as [1, 0], which is |+z>, which is correct, as P would be Pz, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 for [0,1]^T? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when theta is zero, direction is along z. So, the operator P is Pz.

The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1]^T. But according to our formula, [ cos(0), sin(0) ] = [1, 0], which is |+x>. That can't be right. There's a contradiction here.

Ah, I see the problem. It's because in my parametrization, when theta is the angle from the z-axis, the eigenvector for P along z should be |+z>, which is [0,1]^T, but our formula gives [1,0]^T when theta is zero. This suggests a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization of theta. Let me think again.

In the standard spin-½ system, the eigenstates for the spin in direction (theta, phi) are:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

|-> = e^{-i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

In this parametrization, theta is the polar angle (from z-axis), and phi is the azimuthal angle. So, when phi=0, the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in this problem, we're given that the direction n is in the x-z plane, which implies phi=0.

So, when theta is 0 (along z), the state is [ cos(0), sin(0) ] = [1, 0], which corresponds to |+x>, which is correct for spin along x. But in our case, when theta is zero, the direction is along z, and the spin state should be [0,1]^T, not [1,0]^T. So, perhaps I'm parametrizing theta incorrectly.

Ah, wait, perhaps in this problem, theta is measured from the x-axis, not the z-axis. That would explain the discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken n to be (cos theta, 0, sin theta), with theta measured from the x-axis. Let me try that.

So, if n is (cos theta, 0, sin theta), then when theta=0, n is along x, and theta=pi/2 would be along z.

So, in that case, P would be cos theta Px + sin theta Pz.

So, let me recompute.

P = cos theta * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + sin theta * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P is:

(ħ/2) [ [ sin theta, cos theta ],
         [ cos theta, - sin theta ] ]

Wait, earlier, this was the same as before, but now theta is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, but when I set theta=90 degrees (pi/2), then P becomes (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is Pz, and the eigenvector would be [0,1]^T for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Which is correct.

So, when theta=0 (along x), the operator is Px, and the eigenvector should be [1,0]^T, which is correct.

So, perhaps the parametrization is correct when theta is measured from the x-axis.

So, returning to the eigenvector: [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier when theta is 90 degrees, this becomes [ cos(45°), sin(45°) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]^T. Which is the |+x> state, but when theta is 90 degrees, the operator is Pz, and the |+> state should be |+z> = [0,1]^T. So this suggests a problem.

Wait, no. Wait, when theta is 90 degrees in this parametrization (n being (0,0,1)), the operator P is Pz.

In that case, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |+z> = [0,1]^T. But according to the formula we derived earlier, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

When theta=90 degrees, theta/2 is 45 degrees. So, [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]^T, which is the |+x> state. That's not [0,1]^T. So, something's wrong here.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me try to re-examine the problem.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the operator is given by P = nx Px + nz Pz, where nx² + nz² =1. So, the eigenvector equation is (nx Px + nz Pz) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Let me write this in matrix form:

(nx (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

We can factor out (ħ/2):

(nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) |v> = |v>.

Let me compute the matrix:

= [ [ nz, nx ], [nx, -nz ] ]

So,

[ nz a + nx b = a ]

[ nx a - nz b = b ]

Wait, substituting |v> = [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b = 0.

nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz +1) b =0.

From the first equation: (nz -1) a = - nx b → a = [ - nx / (nz -1) ] b.

Let me take the ratio a/b = - nx/(nz -1).

But nz and nx are components of a unit vector, so nz^2 + nx^2 =1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of the direction cosines.

Let me denote the direction vector as (nx,0,nz), with nx^2 + nz^2=1.

So, from the first equation:

(nz -1) a + nx b =0 → a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b.

Wait, because (nz -1) = -(1 - nz).

So, a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b.

Let me choose b = (1 - nz), then a = nx.

Wait, but that would make |v> = [nx, (1 - nz)]^T.

But let's see if this satisfies the second equation:

nx a - nz b = b → nx * nx - nz (1 - nz) = (1 - nz)

→ nx^2 - nz + nz^2 = 1 - nz

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1, substitute:

1 - nz = 1 - nz → 0=0. So yes, this works.

So, the eigenvector is [ nx, (1 - nz) ]^T.

But wait, this is a non-normalized vector. Let me normalize it.

The norm squared is nx^2 + (1 - nz)^2.

But nx^2 + nz^2 =1, so nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.

So,

norm^2 = (1 - nz^2) + (1 - 2 nz + nz^2) = 1 - nz^2 + 1 - 2 nz + nz^2 = 2 - 2 nz.

So, the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(2(1 - nz)).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ nx / sqrt(2(1 - nz)), (1 - nz) / sqrt(2(1 -nz)) ) ]^T = [ nx, 1 - nz ] / sqrt(2(1 - nz)).

But nx and nz are direction cosines: nz is the z-component, nx the x-component.

Wait, if n is (nx,0,nz), then nz = cos(theta) if theta is the angle from the z-axis. Or if theta is measured from the x-axis, then nx = cos(theta), nz = sin(theta). Let's assume theta is measured from the x-axis to avoid confusion.

So, nx = cos(theta), nz = sin(theta).

Substituting into the normalized eigenvector:

a = cos(theta) / sqrt(2(1 - sin(theta)) )

b = (1 - sin(theta)) / sqrt(2(1 - sin(theta)) ) = sqrt( (1 - sin(theta))/2 )

Wait, but let me compute a and b.

a = cos(theta) / sqrt(2(1 - sin(theta)) )
= [ cos(theta) ] / [ sqrt(2) sqrt(1 - sin theta) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 + sin theta):

= [ cos theta * sqrt(1 + sin theta) ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt( (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ) ]

Denominator becomes sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - sin^2 theta) )= sqrt(2) cos theta.

So,

a = [ cos theta * sqrt(1 + sin theta) ] / ( sqrt(2) cos theta ) ) = sqrt( (1 + sin theta) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, b = sqrt( (1 - sin theta) ) / sqrt(2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]^T.

Which can be written as [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]^T.

Now, comparing with the options provided.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But let's check what (cos(theta/2))^2 is: cos²(theta/2) = (1 + cos theta)/2.

But in our solution, the first component is sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), which is not the same as cos(theta/2) unless sin theta = cos theta, which is only true for theta=45 degrees.

Hmm, that suggests that option C might not be the correct one unless I have a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I'm parametrizing theta differently. Let me think about another approach. Let me express the components in terms of theta/2.

Another approach: Let’s consider the eigenvector as [ a, b ]^T.

From the equation, a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b.

Assuming nz = sin theta (if theta is measured from x-axis), then 1 - nz = 1 - sin theta.

So, a = [ cos theta / (1 - sin theta) ] b.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin theta):

a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ] / [ (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ] * b

Denominator is 1 - sin² theta = cos² theta.

So,

a = [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ] / cos² theta * b → a = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta * b.

Which brings us back to a = [ (1 + sin theta)/cos theta ] b.

Which is the same as before.

So, the eigenvector is [ (1 + sin theta), cos theta ]^T, but normalized.

Wait, but in that case, the normalized eigenvector would be [ (1 + sin theta), cos theta ]^T divided by sqrt( (1 + sin theta)^2 + cos^2 theta ) = sqrt( 1 + 2 sin theta + sin² theta + cos² theta ) = sqrt( 2 + 2 sin theta ) = sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)).

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)), cos theta/sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)) ] = [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options except perhaps D, which has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but includes cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, let me look at option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but our solution doesn't have ħ factors, and the components are sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ), which are dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere in the problem. Let me check the question again.

The question says: what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?

The options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our solution, the eigenvector components are [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Hmm, but I'm not seeing any of the options matching this. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the components in terms of theta/2.

Wait, let me try to express (1 + sin theta) in terms of theta/2.

We know that 1 + sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2, but perhaps more usefully, 1 + sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2.

Actually, using the identity:

sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b.

Another approach: 1 + sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2.

Wait, let's compute sin(theta/2 + pi/4):

sin(theta/2 + pi/4) = sin(theta/2) cos(pi/4) + cos(theta/2) sin(pi/4) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

So, [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = 1 + sin theta.

So, sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

Hmm, but that doesn't directly match any of the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which are the standard components for the spin-up state along direction theta, phi=0. Our solution doesn't match this, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is actually the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So, the eigenvector can be written in terms of the direction angles.

Wait, another approach: The eigenvector for spin-up along a direction (theta, phi) is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

In our case, phi=0, so it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which is option C.

But earlier, when I applied this to theta=0, I found it gives [1, 0], which is correct for along x, but in our problem, when the direction is along z, theta would be 90 degrees, so [ cos(45), sin(45) ] which is [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is along x, not along z.

Ah, so perhaps in this problem, the parametrization is such that theta is the angle from the x-axis. So, when theta=0, it's along x, and theta=90 degrees is along z.

In that case, for theta=90 degrees, the eigenvector is [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is the |+x> state. But when the direction is along z (theta=90 degrees), the operator is Pz, and the eigenstate is |+z> = [0,1]^T. Which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the angles. Let me think again. The standard spin-up state along (theta, phi) is:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

In our problem, theta is the angle in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But let's check for theta=90 degrees (along z), then [ cos(45), sin(45) ] which is |+x>, which is correct for P along x.

Wait, but in our problem, when the direction is along z, the operator is Pz, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 for [0,1]^T. But according to the formula, the eigenvector would be |+x>, which is incorrect.

This suggests that perhaps the parametrization of theta in the problem is different. Maybe the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, not the x-axis.

In that case, when theta=0, the direction is along z, and the eigenvector should be [0,1]^T, which matches the |+z> state.

But according to the formula [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], when theta=0, it's [1,0], which is |+x>, which is wrong.

So, perhaps the correct parametrization is:

Eigenvector = [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.

Then, when theta=90 degrees (along z), it becomes [ sin(45), cos(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is |+x>, which is still incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let's try to approach it from another angle.

The correct eigenvector for a spin-½ particle along direction (theta, phi=0) is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But perhaps in this problem, the direction theta is measured from the z-axis, and when theta=0, the direction is along z, so the eigenvector is |+z> = [0,1]^T.

But [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] when theta=0 gives [1,0]^T, which is |+x>.

So, perhaps the parametrization in the problem is different. Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is being treated as a vector in the x-z plane, with theta measured from the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps the initial setup was correct, and the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But earlier, when I computed for the case where theta is measured from the x-axis, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which would be the correct answer.

But when theta=90 degrees (along z), the eigenvector would be [0,1]^T, which is correct.

Wait, no. When theta=90 degrees in this parametrization (measured from x-axis), the direction is along z, and the eigenvector is [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]^T, which is |+x>, which is incorrect.

Ah, I think I'm getting stuck because the parametrization of theta is ambiguous here. Let me try to reconcile this.

If in the problem, theta is the angle from the z-axis, then when theta=0, the direction is along z, and the eigenvector should be [0,1]^T.

But according to the formula [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], when theta=0, it's [1,0]^T, which is |+x>, which is the eigenvector for Px, not Pz.

So, this suggests that the correct parametrization must be theta measured from the x-axis, and the formula is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But then when theta=90 degrees (along z), the eigenvector is [0,1]^T, which is correct for Pz.

Wait, no, because when measured from x-axis, theta=90 degrees implies the direction is along z. So, the eigenvector would be [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is |+x>, but P along z should have eigenvector [0,1]^T.

This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier derivation and the correct eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which would match option C.

But when I applied this to theta=90 degrees, it didn't match. So perhaps the mistake is in the earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the possibility that the eigenvector is expressed in terms of the angle theta measured from the z-axis, which would require a different parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the eigenvector as [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.

Let me check: when theta=90 degrees (along z), this gives [ sin(45), cos(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]^T, which is |+x>, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct parametrization is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T, which for theta=0 would give [0,1]^T, which is correct.

But when theta=90 degrees, it would give [ sin(45), cos(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is |+x>, which is wrong for direction along z.

Hmm, I'm clearly getting stuck here. Let me look back at the options to see which one could fit.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the standard parametrization for the spin-up state.

But according to the earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Let me compute what that would be for theta=0 (along x):

[ sqrt( (1 + 0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - 0)/2 ) ] = [ 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which is the |+x> state, correct.

For theta=90 degrees (along z):

sqrt( (1 + 1)/2 )= sqrt(1) =1,

sqrt( (1 -1)/2 )=0.

So, [1, 0], which is |+x>, which is incorrect for Pz. So, there's a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the eigenvector formula is correct, but perhaps the parametrization of theta is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct answer is option C.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the standard form. But earlier, when theta=90 degrees, this gives [0,1], which is correct for Pz.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me clarify:

If theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, then when theta=0, the direction is along z, and |+> should be [0,1]^T.

In that case, the parametrization [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] would be correct when theta is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the parametrization reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's theta is measured from the x-axis, so when theta=90 degrees, the direction is along z, and the eigenvector is [0,1]^T.

But according to the formula [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], theta=90 degrees gives [0,1], which is correct.

So, perhaps the parametrization in the problem is such that theta is measured from the x-axis, making option C correct.

But earlier, when I used theta measured from the x-axis, the eigenvector came out correctly for theta=0 and theta=90 degrees.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So, the standard parametrization would be option C.

Thus, the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},$
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix},$
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.$

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + n_z \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis), the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. This leads to the matrix equation:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \frac{2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)}{2\sin^2(\theta/2)} b = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \cot(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sin(\theta/2)/\cos(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The norm is:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \csc(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\csc(\theta/2)} \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the standard parametrization of the spin-up state along a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.**

ANSWER: C
