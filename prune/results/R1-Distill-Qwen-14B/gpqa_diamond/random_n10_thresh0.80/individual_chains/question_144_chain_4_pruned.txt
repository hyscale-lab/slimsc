Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some numbers: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with various scientific notations.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think I need is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. Oh right, because distance is speed multiplied by time.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right! The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ * τ ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, no, I think it's actually Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense because Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. So higher Γ means shorter lifetime, which makes sense because a wider peak is a shorter-lived particle.

Once I have the lifetime, I need the velocity of the meson. For that, I can use the relativistic energy equations. The energy E of a particle is related to its mass and velocity. The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since E is given as the production energy, which I suppose is the total energy of the meson.

Wait, the problem says E_X is 8 GeV, which is the production energy. So E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass and the kinetic energy. So I can find the momentum p from E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Let me write that down. E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Then p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but E and m are both in GeV and MeV. Let me make sure the units are consistent. Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 Ge
