Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star, I think.

The question says both planets have the same mass. Hmm, but their orbital periods are different. Planet 1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet 2. So Planet 1 is closer to its star than Planet 2. That makes sense because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit (closer in) if the star's mass is similar.

Wait, but the host stars have different masses. Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's. Oh, and both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though the host of Planet 1 is more massive, it's not larger in radius. I remember that for stars, more massive ones are usually bigger, but maybe in this case, they're evolved or something. Wait, no, Planet 2's host is slightly evolved. So Planet 1's star is a main-sequence star with twice the mass, but same radius?

Wait, same radius but higher mass. That might imply that Planet 1's star is hotter, maybe. But how does that affect transit probability?

I think the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the likelihood that the planet's orbit is aligned with our line of sight. Oh, right! The probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a√(1-e²))) )... Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is given by the formula:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing some formulas here. Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (a_p) / (a_p) √(1-e²) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / d), where d is something else? Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for transit probability.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / r), where
