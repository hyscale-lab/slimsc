Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's in terms of x and y. I remember that in general relativity or differential geometry, the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. The area of a surface can often be found by integrating the area element over the surface.

The area element, I think, is usually sqrt(g_ij) dx dy or something like that. Wait, in 2D, if the metric is diagonal, like here it is, because dx² + dy² is multiplied by the same factor. So the metric tensor is diagonal with both components equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor, g, would be the product of the diagonal terms because it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The metric tensor in 2D can be written as a matrix:
[ g_xx   0    ]
[ 0     g_yy ]

So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. In this case, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant g = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

But wait, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element is actually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh wait, no, wait. I think for the area, it's the square root of the determinant times dx dy. Let me clarify: The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) d²σ, where d²σ is dx dy. So in this case, sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²), because sqrt[(32/(4 - x² - y²))²] is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So maybe the metric given is that of a pseudosphere. Or perhaps it's a different kind of surface.

Wait, I should think about the form of the metric. Let me see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the domain of x and y is such that 4 - x² - y² is positive. So x² + y² <4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the metric is defined on the disk where x² + y² <4.

But what does this metric represent? Let me think about how metrics for surfaces are written. For a sphere, the metric is often in terms of angles, like in spherical coordinates. But here, it's expressed in terms of x and y, which suggests it's a coordinate system on some surface.

Wait, a pseudosphere (like a tractricoid) has a metric that can be expressed in terms of coordinates, perhaps similar to this. Alternatively, maybe it's
