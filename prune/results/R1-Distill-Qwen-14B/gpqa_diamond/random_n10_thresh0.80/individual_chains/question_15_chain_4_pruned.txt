Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular, so that simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that probably doesn't affect the radius much here since they're already given as the same.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula I recall is that the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. For the probability, it's more about the orbital plane's alignment with our line of sight.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's size to the distance between the planet and its star. Or wait, actually, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is closer to edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do we calculate the probability based on the given parameters?

Wait, I think the probability (p) of a transit is given by p = (R_* + R_p)^2 / a^2, but I'm not sure. Or is it p = (R_p / R_*) multiplied by a certain factor. No, wait, I think the formula for the probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)Â² * (something else?), but I might be mixing up the formulas.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star (as seen from Earth) to the distance of the planet from the star. Hmm, not exactly. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on. Since the orbit is
