Okay, so I have this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory used when the new physics is at a high scale, beyond the Standard Model. The idea is that you can write down all possible interactions respecting certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A to D, each with different combinations.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Then there's CP, which is charge conjugation combined with parity, and CPT, which combines charge, parity, and time reversal.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed from the Standard Model fields. The Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries. But how does SMEFT handle them? I remember that SMEFT operators are built in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM has a symmetry, the SMEFT operators should also respect it.

Wait, the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, right? Because it's a relativistic theory. So all its operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So the SMEFT, which incorporates the SM, must also respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For instance, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So operators in the SM can violate CP. Therefore, SMEFT operators might not necessarily respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP, isn't a must.

CPT symmetry, though, is a big one. The CPT theorem states that in quantum field theories, CPT symmetry must be respected. So any operator in a QFT must have CPT symmetry. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a second. Wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry than Lorentz. So if the theory already respects Poincare, then it automatically respects Lorentz. So the operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So when the question says, which must be respected by all operators, perhaps Poincare is the one that's required.

Wait, but the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare is more than Lorentz—so do the operators have to respect both? Or is Poincare already encompassing Lorentz?

Wait, no, operators in a relativistic theory are constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group, which includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. Therefore, if the question says which symmetries must be respected, Poincare would imply Lorentz is also respected. But the question lists them as separate options. So perhaps the correct way is that operators must respect all the symmetries they have to regardless of being subsumed.

Wait the question is, which must be respected by all operators. So, for example, if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So perhaps the operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2), which implies Lorentz (1) is also respected. So if option 2 is correct, but the question includes 1 and 2 as separate options.

Wait, but the question is about which of the listed symmetries "must be respected". So whether each is individually a must.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are written in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying SM. Since the SM has Poincare symmetry, so do SMEFT operators. Therefore, options 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the SM does not have CPT symmetry necessarily? No, the SM does respect CPT. But wait, no. The SM includes CPT symmetry. Because all the particles have their antiparticles etc. So operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So any operator in a quantum field theory must obey CPT because of the CPT theorem. So even if the underlying theory has CPT violation, the operators must still respect CPT. Wait, no, the CPT theorem is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any QFT must be CPT symmetric. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT, so option 4 is correct.

So let me recap. The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, isn't Poincare a subset? No, Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 2 and 4, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again:

Options:
A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4. So if all three are required, but if respecting Poincare implies Lorentz is respected, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but for the theory, the operators are constructed to be Poincare invariant. So that would include Lorentz. So when the question asks which must be respected, does it mean that the operators must individually respect each symmetry? Or are the symmetries that the theory must respect as a whole.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether each symmetry is a separate requirement. For example, if you have Poincare, you don't need to separately mention Lorentz because it's a part of it.

But the question lists them as separate options. So perhaps in the context of the question, the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, regardless of whether they are parts of larger symmetry groups.

Wait, but Poincare is a larger symmetry. So perhaps the correct answer is 2 and 4, but there's no option for that. The options are A (1,2), C (1,2,4). Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. SMEFT is a theory that includes translations because it's a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2). Because all terms are local (as in the SM), which is a requirement for translation invariance.

So both 1 and 2 are required. CPT must be respected (4) because of the CPT theorem. So all three are required.

Wait, but how about the Standard Model? The SM does include CPT symmetry. So the operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So the answer would be option C: 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates all possible interactions compatible with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, extended to include higher-dimensional operators. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Here's the analysis:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. This ensures invariance under Lorentz transformations, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects translation symmetry, and all operators are local, ensuring Poincaré symmetry is respected. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, making this symmetry optional.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory, ensuring that any QFT must respect CPT symmetry. As SMEFT is a QFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). While Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, both are explicitly required in the question, so they are both included in the answer.

**Answer: C**
