Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of stars and their magnitudes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is figuring out which stars are within the brightness limits of both instruments. 

I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, the question says stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, I think that forESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude should be less than or equal to 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star with V mag of 16 would be brighter than 17, so it's observable. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars up to V=17, but not fainter (like V=18 or more). Or wait, no: wait, the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag." Oh, so if a star's V magnitude is lower (brighter) than 17, then it's within the observable range. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17. Because 17 is the limit—brighter stars are those with lower magnitudes. So for example, a V magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17, so it's okay.

Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. So stars with V <=16 mag can be observed by HIRES.

Wait no. Let me think again. If a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, is that brighter than 17? Yes. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16, because they're brighter than 16 mag. And ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17.

So the stars need to have an apparent V magnitude that is ≤16 to be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's within both's limits. But if it's between 16 and 17, HIRES won't see it, but ESPRESSO will. So the stars that are bright enough for both would have V ≤16.

Wait, but wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So if a star is brighter than 17, like V=16, which is brighter than 17, yeah ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag (so V ≤16) can be observed.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me rephrase: the condition is "brighter than X mag." So, for each telescope, a star's apparent V mag must be brighter than X. So, the allowed V mag is less than X.

So for ESPRESSO, V <17. For HIRES
