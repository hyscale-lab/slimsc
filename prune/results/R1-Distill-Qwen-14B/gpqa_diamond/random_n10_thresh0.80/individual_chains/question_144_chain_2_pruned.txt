Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me X as a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. They can decay into other particles, and the decay properties depend on various factors like their energy, mass, and width.

The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And the question is about the mean decay distance. So, I need to find out how far on average this meson will travel before decaying.

Wait, what determines the decay distance? I think it's related to the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel because it has more time to move. But how do I calculate that?

I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the decay width Γ is given in MeV. Oh right, energy units. And ħ has units of GeV·s when using appropriate units. Let me recall the value of ħ. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, first, I should convert Γ_X into GeV. The width is 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, that's 0.32 GeV.

Then, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is roughly around 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that correctly. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 20e-25 is 2e-24, right. So yeah, about 2.057e-24 seconds.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 /0.32) × 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah, that's correct.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the decay distance L is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the speed of this meson? Since it's produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass (1.2 GeV), it's definitely moving relativistically.

I need to find the velocity of the meson. To do that, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².

Wait, but the units here are in GeV, so I should probably express everything in compatible units. Let's see, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of natural units where c=1 and so on.

Wait, let's think about it step by step.

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, no, m is 1.2 GeV, but in units where c=1, mass is in GeV/c², but when you multiply by c², you get GeV. So in E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, but if we're using units where c=1, it simplifies to E² = p² + m².

So in natural units, E in GeV, p in GeV/c, but with c=1, p is in GeV.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the momentum p.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but with c in m/s, I need to convert units.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute in terms of beta (β) and gamma (γ) factors. Since E = γ m c², and p = γ β m v, where v is the velocity.

Wait, let's compute β first. β is v / c. And γ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = E/(m c²). Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So,

γ
