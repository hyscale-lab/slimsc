Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is given, and I have to choose the correct statement among the options A to D.

First, let me understand what's given.

The operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, writing S out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's think about how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, I is the identity matrix.

But wait, perhaps it's easier if I first compute the eigenvalues of S, and then see how scaling by c affects them.

Because if Ay = c * S, then the eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of S first.

The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let's compute its trace and determinant. The trace Tr(S) is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant det(S) is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = -(-(-1)) because i^2 is -1. Wait, i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1?

Wait, let me compute that again. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc.

So for S: a=0, d=0. b=-i, c=i.

So det(S) = (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ].

What's (-i)(i)? Multiply it out: (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So det(S) is 0 - (1) = -1.

So the characteristic equation for S is λ² - Tr(S) λ + det(S) = 0 → λ² - 0 * λ - (-1) → λ² +1 = 0. So λ² = -1 → λ = ±i.

So the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Now, since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c * i and c * (-i).

Substituting c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * i and (h/(4π)) * (-i).

Wait, but the eigenvalues of S are imaginary. So when we scale by c, which is a real number, the eigenvalues remain purely imaginary but scaled by c.

So, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± (h/(4π)) * i. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. But looking at the options, the options discuss the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, their real parts would be zero, not ±h/(4π). So option A can't be correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are (h/(4π))i and -(h/(4π) i. Are these 1/2 and -1/2 in imaginary parts? Let's compute h/(4π). Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, but the exact value isn't needed here. Wait, perhaps the units are in terms of ħ, which is h/(2π). Let me think: ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ.

So substituting c = (h)/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= (2 ħ * π) / (4 π) )= ħ/2.

So c= ħ / 2. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)*i and -(ħ/2) * i.

Wait, but the units are getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of angular momentum. For spin-½ particles, the spin component S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, no, wait: The Pauli matrices (which S resembles) have eigenvalues ±1/2 when multiplied by ħ
