Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given parameters are mass m, maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The options involve expressions with c, the speed of light, so I know relativistic effects must come into play here.

Wait, in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? But since we're dealing with relativity, that's probably not directly applicable. Relativistic effects usually come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of c, so the maximum speed here would be modified by some relativistic factor.

But wait, let me think: the question is about a relativistic oscillator. So the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² as in the classical case. In the relativistic scenario, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator might be different. Or maybe the equation of motion incorporates relativistic terms.

Wait, another thought: in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. So maybe the total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

In classical mechanics, the total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is purely potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), it's purely kinetic. But in relativity, since energy and momentum are linked, perhaps the expressions are different.

So, let's model this. The relativistic energy equation for a particle might be E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But wait, this is for a free particle. Here, the particle is in a potential, so I need to think about how the potential energy contributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's equation of motion is modified. The classical equation is F = -kx, leading to d²x/dt² + (k/m)x = 0. But in relativity, perhaps the mass increases with velocity, so the effective mass changes.

Wait, effective mass in relativity: When a particle moves, its relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass. So, m_rel = gamma m. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, maybe the equation of motion becomes d²x/dt² + (k/(m gamma)) x = 0. Hmm, but that complicates things because gamma depends on velocity, which makes the equation nonlinear.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this by considering energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy from the spring.

At maximum displacement A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)k A². Wait, but wait, in the relativistic case, is the potential energy still (1/2)k x²? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Maybe that's a classical assumption and in relativity, the potential energy expression might be different.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the problem is using the classical form for potential energy but incorporating relativistic momentum. So, the total mechanical energy E is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical potential energy.

In that case, E would be equal to the total energy, which would be (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, wait. Wait, no. Because when the oscillator is at x=A, its velocity is zero, but its potential energy is (1/2) k A². So the total energy would be the potential energy plus the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy, but wait, the kinetic energy is zero here. Or is it?

Wait, no, in relativity, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest (v=0), so E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, wait, no: the potential energy is (1/2)
