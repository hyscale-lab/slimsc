Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax. So, d ≈ 1/plx. But wait, in this case, the relation between N and plx is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So if I can express plx in terms of d, maybe I can find how N depends on d.

Let me write that down. Parallax plx is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So, substituting plx into the expression for N, which is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Or wait, no—wait. The number of stars in the region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, as distance increases, how does the count change? 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), then substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, does that mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases? Because d^5 grows quickly. But wait, in reality, I thought that as you look further away, you might expect more stars because the volume you're considering is larger. Oh, wait, the number of stars you can see would depend on the volume, which scales with r^3 (since volume is 4/3 pi r^3). But this is a different scenario.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the number of stars varies
