Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular pattern. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws, so I guess I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, what's parallax again? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbital motion around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. That means lower parallax values correspond to more distant stars.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's think about how star distribution works. If stars are uniformly distributed, that should mean that the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant throughout space. So, n = constant.

But wait, the way we observe stars is by their apparent brightness and their distances. The number of stars we can see at a certain distance depends on the volume of the sphere at that distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so as distance (r) increases, the volume increases with the cube of the radius. But because the number density is constant, the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr would be n * (4πr² dr), which is proportional to r² dr.

But how does that tie into parallax? Parallax plx is 1/r, so r is 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. If r = 1/plx, then r² = 1/(plx)^2. But wait, I need to relate the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about how the number of stars in a range of parallax depends on plx.

The number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx would correspond to stars at distances r and r + dr, where dr is the change in distance. Since plx = 1/r, then dplx = - (1/r²) dr. Oh right, because if plx decreases as r increases, the differential is negative. But since we're considering a small range, the sign might not matter for the magnitude.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell (parallax range dplx) is N = n * 4π r² dr. But I want this in terms of plx. So, let's express everything in terms of plx.

First, express r in terms of plx: r = 1/plx.

So, r² = 1/(plx)^2.

Now, dr in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/r, dplx = - (1/r²) dr. Rearranging, dr = - r² dplx. But since r = 1/plx, dr = -(1/plx)^2 dplx.

But wait, when plx increases, r decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, r decreases. Hmm, perhaps I should take absolute values since we're talking
