Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data provided.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data and what it tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak they're talking about is very broad. Carboxylic acids have a very strong, broad O-H stretch, but sometimes alcohols can also show a broad peak if the solution is a bit concentrated or if the alcohol is in a specific environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH from something else, like a phenol? Hmm, but phenols usually have a broad peak too.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, maybe a carboxylic acid, or an amide. The 1650 is a bit lower than the usual for a carbonyl but could be due to conjugation or something else. Like maybe an aromatic ring? Wait, wait, another possibility: an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Or perhaps an acid derivative.

So, putting that together, the compound has at least one carbonyl group. And maybe an O-H group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. That could be part of a conjugated system with the carbonyl group, so maybe something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Like a ketone with a double bond adjacent.

Then, the mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass. The molecular ion could break in such a way that a fragment with a molecular weight of 45 is formed. What fragments have a mass of 45? Well, let's calculate possible combinations.

45 could be C3H7O, but wait, the formula for that would be C3H7O. Let's calculate: (12*3)+(1*7)+(16*1)= 36 +7 +16=60. No, that's not 45. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHO, which is butanol. That's C4H9O. Molecular weight is (12*4)+(1*9)+16=48+9+16=73. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be (CH3)CO, which is acetone. Molecular weight of acetone is 58 (since it's C3H6O). No, that's not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like a CH2O group? Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. No, that's too low.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The possible fragments that sum up to 45. Let's see, 45 could be C3H3O2 (if it's something like propenoic acid? Molecular weight is 12*3 +1*3 +16*2 = 36+3+32=71, which doesn't help). Or perhaps a CO (28) plus something else? Alternatively, maybe a CH2 group and another fragment.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me consider the possible molecular formulas that add up to 45. Maybe a methyl group (15) plus a CO (28) gives 43, which is close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group (3*12 +8*1=44) plus O? Wait, not sure.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me compute their molecular weights.

C6H12O: (6*12)=72 + (12*1)=12 + (16)=16 → 72+12=84, 84+16=100.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 6 carbons: 6 *12 =72. H12: 12 *1=12. O: 16. So 72+12+16=100. So molecular weight is 100.

C6H10O: 6*12=72 +10*1=10 +16=16 → 72+10=82 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 6*12=72 +10*1=10 +32 → 72+10=82 +32=114.

C6H12O2: 6*12=72 +12*1=12 +32=116.

In the mass spectrum, the m/z=45 peak is a fragment. So the parent ion probably has a molecular weight larger than 45, which all the options are.

So, what fragment would give 45? Let's think about each option's structure.

Looking at the options:

Option D: C6H12O. That's a molecular formula for something like cyclohexanol or maybe a cyclic ether but it's hard. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak, so maybe an ester or something else. Wait, no, C6H12O is an alcohol or ether.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak and a carbonyl. So it's possible that the compound has both O-H (broad peak) and a carbonyl. So for instance, an ester would have a carbonyl (so maybe two peaks: ester carbonyl is around 1740, but in this case, it's at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, perhaps an acid derivative.

Wait, maybe it's a beta-keto ester or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but let's go back to each point.

FTIR: broad at 3000 (O-H), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (probably a carbonyl and possibly conjugated with something else, like an aromatic ring or another double bond).

1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So that's at least a double bond in the structure.

Mass spec has a peak at 45. Let's think about the molecular formula options and which could lose a fragment of 45.

Wait, perhaps the parent compound loses a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one. Alternatively,
