Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities and energies in relativity, it's not as straightforward as classical mechanics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So, first, the relative speed. I think I need to calculate the speed of one astronaut as seen from the frame of the other. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities directly. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. Here, astronaut A has v1 = 0.6c, and astronaut B has v2 = 0.5c. So, substituting:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplifying the numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's close enough. Okay, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That probably narrows it down to options C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut has relativistic energy, I need to calculate their respective energies and sum them up. The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so it's 2m * c² * gamma. Right, so 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So that's about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is less, so not matching.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but why did I get 0.1428c as the relative speed? The options have 0.14c, which is a rounded value. So that
