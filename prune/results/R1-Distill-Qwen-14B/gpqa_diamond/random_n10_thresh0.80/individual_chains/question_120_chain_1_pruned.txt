Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are different power laws of 1 over plx to some exponent.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 pc is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 pc would be 2 parsecs away. Wait, no, actually, wait. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if a star is at distance d parsecs, plx is 1/d.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So how many stars are there in a given range of parallax values. Let's think about the distribution. Since stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I guess that means they're spread out uniformly in all directions. But how does that translate to parallax?

Wait, the number density of stars isn't uniform in Euclidean space, but if they are uniformly distributed, maybe in terms of their positions, but how does that affect the count when considering parallax?

Let me think about volume. The volume around the Earth increases with the cube of the distance. So if you consider a sphere of radius d, the volume is (4/3)πd³. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume, which is proportional to d³.

But parallax is inversely related to distance. So if d is large, plx is small. Let me denote plx as p. So p = 1/d, which means d = 1/p.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the surface area of the sphere times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since the question is about the number per unit parallax range, let's express this in terms of p.

Since d = 1/p, the number of stars in a range of parallax from p to p + dp is the same as the number in the shell at d from 1/p to 1/(p+dp). Wait, actually, the number of stars in a range of parallax Δp would correspond to a certain range in distance. But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of p.

Let me try to express the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think of the number of stars per unit p. So, the number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is N = n * (volume between d and d + dd). But we need to express this in terms of p.

Wait, the volume between d and d+dd (a thin shell) is 4πd² dd. So N = n * 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because
