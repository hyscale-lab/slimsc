Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is a light beam moving through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the laboratory. And they remind us that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. The options are A to D, with various formulas.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially when objects are moving relative to each other, we might need to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Wait, but wait—does this problem involve relativistic speeds? Because if v is not too large, maybe we can approximate with classical mechanics. But the question is about the speed of light, which in a vacuum is always c, but here it's in a medium, glass.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, right? So in the glass, the light's speed is v_light = c/n = 1/n because c=1. But wait, that's the speed in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, considering the glass is moving.

So, how do velocities transform between frames? Oh right, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). Wait, but here
