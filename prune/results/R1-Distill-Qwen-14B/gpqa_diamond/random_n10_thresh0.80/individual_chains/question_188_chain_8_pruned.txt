Okay, so I have this crystallography problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. The question is about calculating the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, no, rhombohedral usually has all sides equal but the angles can vary, but sometimes it's called a rhombic system. So yeah, this fits.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure would be the lattice parameter 'a'. So the lattice constant a is 10 Angstrom.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(θ) * (something) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the general formula when the lattice is not cubic is more complicated. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, a = b = c, but the angles are different.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given
