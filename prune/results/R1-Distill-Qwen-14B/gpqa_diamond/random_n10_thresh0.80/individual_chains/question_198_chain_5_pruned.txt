Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the deal with these stability constants? Oh right, they tell us how stable the complexes are. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it's more likely to form from the ions.

So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. The β values increase up to β3 and then drop for β4. Interesting. So the most stable is the [Co(SCN)3]^2- complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Blue usually refers to the hexaaquachromium(II) ion, but wait, no, wait, in cobalt complexes, the blue one is the tetraammine dithiocyanato cobalt(II) maybe? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the blue ones are often the ones with more SCN- attached. Or maybe the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN- ligands. So the complexes in question are Co(SCN)_2, perhaps?

Wait, the problem refers to "dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- per Co^2+ ion. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But the exact charge isn't specified, but I think it doesn't matter for the calculation.

Wait, the main point is to find the fraction of Co that is in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or something similar. Or maybe it's the Co(SCN)_2 species. Hmm.

Let me think about the approach. I remember that when you have a metal ion and a ligand, the fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the
