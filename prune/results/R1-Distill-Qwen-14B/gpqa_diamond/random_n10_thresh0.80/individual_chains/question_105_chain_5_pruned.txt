Okay, let's see. I have this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and how their brightness changes over time. The question is about determining the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots. Hmm.

So, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. Oh wait, the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km? Or maybe I should just keep it as Rstar = R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, which is a bit hotter than the Sun. But wait, the spots are cooler, right? Because they're dark spots, probably sunspots. Oh, the temperature difference is 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K if the star is 6000K. Wait, no, the question says a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are either 5000K or 7000K? But since they're dark spots, they must be cooler. So spots are 5000K.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots cover 0.2 of that hemisphere. Wait, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). Hmm. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip in brightness when they're facing us. The variation in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem is comparing this situation to an exoplanet transit. When a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

So, we need to find the exoplanet radius Rp such that the dip caused by the planet is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But wait, the dip from the spots isn't just the area times some factor because the spots are cooler. Oh, wait
