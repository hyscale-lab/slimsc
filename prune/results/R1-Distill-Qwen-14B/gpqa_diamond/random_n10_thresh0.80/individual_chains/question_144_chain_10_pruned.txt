Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't live very long, so it decays quickly. The question is about the mean decay distance. 

The problem gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I need to compute the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I think the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel. But for particles that decay quickly, like this meson, the distance is very small. So I need to find the lifetime first.

I recall that the lifetime (tau) is related to the width (Γ) by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But in particle physics, the relation is often written as τ = ħ / Γ, but wait, I should double-check. Oh right, the natural line width is Γ, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, sometimes people use Γ = ħ / τ, so yeah, that's correct.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The width Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. That sounds right. Because Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. So using the uncertainty principle, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, so I need to convert units properly.

Once I have the lifetime τ, then I can find the decay distance. The decay distance (L) is the speed (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But what's the speed of the meson? The meson is moving with some energy E. Its mass is given as m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can compute its velocity.

I remember that for relativistic particles, the energy E is related to momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. But since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c
