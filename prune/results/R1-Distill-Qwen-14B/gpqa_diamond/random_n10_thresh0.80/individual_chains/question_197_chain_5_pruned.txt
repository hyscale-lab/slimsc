Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I'll look at the IR data provided. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region usually indicates the presence of either alcohols, amines, or maybe an acidic proton. But wait, the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The 1720 peak is a strong sign of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions might be indicating some double bonds, perhaps aromatic rings since those typically absorb in those regions.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H), which is very high. That's probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, sometimes a carboxylic acid can also show a peak around there, but usually as a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding. But looking at the other NMR data, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H, which is probably a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H could be a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3). There's a 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) which might be a CH group, and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) possibly another CH2 group. The 8.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring because the two doublets are integrating to two protons each, which is typical for a para substitution. So, the aromatic region points to a benzene ring with two substituents across from each other.

Putting this together, the compound probably has a para-substituted benzene ring. The IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative or a benzoic acid. But wait, the NMR has an aldehyde proton at 10.5—so perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with other substituents.

But wait, the aldehyde proton would typically be around 9-10 ppm. Another possibility is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Hmm.

Looking again, the IR has a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, which is more indicative of an ester or a ketone or aldehyde. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be a bit lower, around 1700 cm⁻¹ and maybe with a broad O-H peak around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹. But in the IR here, the broad region is 3400–2500. So maybe it's an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid with a broad peak from the -OH group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. At 10.5 ppm, if it's a broad singlet, it might be a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually less broad. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is an enol proton, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch. Let me see: the IR data says 3400–2500. That's a broad range. If that's O-H, then it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5, which is more in line with an aldehyde than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H protons which are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But in this case, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which could be either. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's see. The aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests that the substituents are para. So the benzene ring has two groups in the para positions.

So, maybe the structure is something like para-substituted benzaldehyde with an alkyl chain. Let's think about the NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3)—so perhaps a branching here. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group attached to something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups. So putting this together, perhaps the structure is (4-ethylphenyl)propanal? Or maybe a branched chain attached to the benzaldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the NMR shifts. The 0.9 triplet is probably a terminal CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet of 3H is a methyl group attached to a CH—like in an isopropyl group. The 2.9 multiplet is the CH that's connected to both the aromatic ring and the CH(CH3) group. And the 1.7 is the two H's on the CH2 that connects to the CH.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde. Because propan-2-yl would have a CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the aldehyde.

Wait, but let me try to reconstruct the structure. The aromatic ring has an aldehyde group and another substituent para to it. The substituent is a branched chain. So let's say the substituent is a (CH2) group attached to a CH(CH3) and another CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps it's a 4-(2-ethylpropyl)benzaldehyde? Or maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but with branching. Let me think about the NMR again. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is that CH. Then, a CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (2H). And the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So putting that together, the substituent is perhaps CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene? Wait, no, because I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, it's a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. So maybe the substituent is CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the aromatic ring. Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)? No, wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, no—Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So, for a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, no—Wait, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. So, primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3-, but that's four carbons. Isobutyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH3)) group. So, the substituent on the benzene would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) for 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH. So, that's a CH(CH3). Then the 2.9 ppm (m) is the CH. The 1.7 ppm (m) is two H's on a CH2. And 0.9 triplet is 3H, so that's a CH2CH3. So, the substituent is a
