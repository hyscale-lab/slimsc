Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The problem gives me the initial volume and concentration of acetic acid, the volume of water it's diluted with, and the concentration of NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I can check my answers against them once I work through it.

First, let's understand the problem setup. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, we're looking at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I should calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The formula for dilution is C1V1 = C2V2. So, the initial concentration C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. The final volume V2 is 0.04 L. So, C2 equals (C1 * V1) / V2.

Calculating that: (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, during titration with NaOH, the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) would be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate ions (CH3COO^-). But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at 25%? Let's think about moles first.

The initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles would react with 0.001 moles of NaOH. Because the reaction is 1:1, right? So, the equivalence point requires 0.001 moles of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. So that's 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So, 0.00025 moles of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate.

So, the remaining acetic acid would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Wait, but when you add NaOH, it's a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid. At 25% titration, before equivalence, the solution will be a buffer solution containing both CH3COOH and CH3COO^-.

So, to find the pH at 25% titration, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), where [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, pKa is given by the Ka. The Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, which rounds to 4.74).

Hmm, but wait, let me calculate that again. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 ×10^-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, which I can approximate as 4.73.

So, at 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477.

So, pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, the first part should be around 4.25. Let's see the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Hmm, so 4.26 is pretty close. So perhaps option A is a candidate. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps.

Wait, but wait, the volume after adding NaOH? Hmm, because when you add a certain volume of NaOH, the total volume changes. Oh wait, but in the problem, the 25% refers to the fraction of the acetic acid neutralized, not the volume of NaOH added. Or is it referring to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence?

Wait, no, in titration problems, when it's percentage titration, it's usually the percentage of the stoichiometric amount. So, 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 25% of the moles required for equivalence.

Yes, that's correct. So the moles of NaOH is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So, the solution after adding that NaOH would have a total volume of initial solution (40 mL) plus the volume of NaOH added. But wait, wait, to get accurate concentration, I need to find the total volume.

Wait, but when dealing with buffer solutions, sometimes the volume can be neglected if the volumes are similar, but in reality, we should calculate it accurately.

So, let's proceed.

The initial solution is 40 mL (from 20 mL acetic acid + 20 mL H2O). Then, when adding NaOH, how much volume is that? Let's compute the volume of NaOH needed for 25% titration.

Because the equivalence point requires 0.001 moles of NaOH. So 25% is 0.00025 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume (L) = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. So, the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations of HA and A^- in the solution are:

HA (acetic acid): initial moles minus reacted moles = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles, in 0.0425 L. So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

A^- (acetate): 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Wait, 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333.

So log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Hmm, which is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26. That's very close. So I think that's correct.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. So, the solution will consist of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) in solution. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence can be calculated. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles (same as initial moles of acetic acid), and the total volume is the initial solution plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence.

Volume of NaOH at equivalence: moles needed is 0.001, concentration 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So total volume is 40 mL +10 mL=50 mL = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ions will hydrolyze as follows:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb =5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH^- produced:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, approximating:

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.49 (since log(3.29)=0.517, so 5.483 → about 5.48).

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.48 ≈8.52.

Wait, so at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26; 8.52. So that matches both values.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the Kb calculation? Because sometimes when dealing with acetate, the pH can be around 8.5, which is what I got.

But wait, another approach is to calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid in water. The pH can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw + log C )

Wait, no. Alternatively, since we derived Kb, and then used it to find [OH^-], which gives the pH as 8.52, which matches option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that seems correct.

But wait, let me double-check the Kb calculation.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the Kb calculation is right. Then the [OH^-] is about 3.29e-6, leading to pOH≈5.48, pH≈8.52.

But wait, let me think about the buffer calculation again. The initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid was 0.025 M, right? After adding 20 mL of water to 20 mL of 0.05 M, yes, 0.025 M. So that part is correct.

Wait another thing: when I calculated the concentrations of HA and A^- after 25% titration, I considered the total volume as 42.5 mL (40 mL +2.5 mL NaOH). But wait, since 25% titration is 2.5 mL of NaOH, which is correct. So the calculations are correct.

But another way to approach the 25% titration is to calculate the moles in the solution, then find concentrations.

Another approach: the solution after 25% titration is a buffer. Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 * (1 -0.25) = 0.00075. Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL =42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A^-] =0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 =0.333333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) =4.73 -0.477≈4.253. So 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

So yeah, that's correct. So the pH at 25% is ~4.25 and at equivalence ~8.52, which is option A.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → matches.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → equivalence point way lower. So probably not.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → way lower pH, that can't be right.

Option C: 4.73;7.00 → 4.73 is the pKa, so at 25% it's lower than that.

So the correct answer must be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{(0.05 \, \text{M})(0.020 \, \text{L})}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid are then:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = (0.025 \, \text{M})(0.040 \, \text{L}) = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reaction produces 0.00025 moles of acetate (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) and leaves:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 mL of NaOH (calculated as \( \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 2.5 \, \text{mL} \)) is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.5 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{mL} + 10.00 \, \text{mL} = 50.00 \, \text{mL} = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( x \) be the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) at equilibrium:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x \approx 0.020 \). Solving:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.020 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

Answer: A
