Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, I think I'm supposed to focus on the area calculation here.

The given metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks familiar. So 4 - x² - y² is like 4 - r² in polar coordinates, where r² is x² + y². So if I rewrite this, maybe in terms of r?

Let me think about the area element in this metric. Normally, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric given is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Looking at the metric, both dx and dy have the same coefficient, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g would be [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, so sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - r²). Because sqrt of [32/(4-r²)] squared is 32/(4-r²). So the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

But wait, that's in Cartesian coordinates. Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting, the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area A would be the integral over r and θ. What are the limits of integration? The metric's denominator is 4 - r², which must be positive because otherwise the metric would have issues (like singularities). So 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r <2. So r goes from 0 to 2, θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the integral becomes the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Let's compute this.

First, separate the integrals because the integrand is a product of functions of r and θ. The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, so that's straightforward. The r integral is ∫₀² [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

So let's compute the θ part first. The integral of dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So the area A = 2π * ∫₀² [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Now the r integral: ∫ [32 r dr] / (4 - r²). Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (-du/2)] / u. The limits change when r is 0, u=4, and r=2, u=0. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=
