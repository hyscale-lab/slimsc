Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is also provided, and there are three reagents used in sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I should probably figure out what the starting compound looks like based on the NMR data. Let me go through the NMR signals one by one.

The 1H-NMR data is:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what each of these signals could represent.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm triplet. That's a pretty high ppm, so maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's part of an enal structure, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde next to two other protons.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets. Those are in the aromatic region. Each is a doublet, so maybe each is part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think: for a para-substituted aromatic, the coupling between adjacent protons would cause a doublet. Wait, no, wait. In a para-substituted benzene, each H is equivalent, so if it's a substituent in the para position, like a substituent on benzene, each pair would be a doublet. Alternatively, it could be a di-substituted ring where each set of two Hs is a doublet. Let me think about that.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something else, like an -OH proton. But wait, the molecular formula has an O and an N. Oh, wait the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. 

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) can be calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. X is 0, so substituting:

DoU = (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could mean a ring and a double bond, or multiple rings and double bonds.

Each benzene ring contributes three DoU. So if we have one benzene, that's three, leaving two more from the rest. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the NMR data again. The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That might be a CH2 group attached
