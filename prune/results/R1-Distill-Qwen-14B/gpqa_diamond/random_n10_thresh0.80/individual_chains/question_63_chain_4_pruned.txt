Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule's energy states. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember from my notes that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state. So, the molecule is currently in its lowest energy state, and it absorbs a photon to go to the next state. I think that means it's going from the ground state to the first excited state.

The molecule is X-Y, with masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. I need to find the momentum p of the photon.

I remember that the energy levels in the rotational-vibration model are quantized. For vibration, the energy levels are given by something like E_v = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, it's E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

But wait, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, that means the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy is E_total = E_v + E_J.

In the fundamental vibrational state, I think v is 0, so E_v is (0 + 1/2) h w. For the next state, maybe the molecule could go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, I think that means the smallest possible increase in energy. So the photon should cause the molecule to transition to the next possible state with the least energy difference.

Wait, the possible transitions would be either increasing the vibrational quantum number from v=0 to v=1 or increasing the rotational quantum number from J=0 to J=1, or maybe from J=1 to J=2, etc. Which of these requires the least energy? Because the photon must match the energy difference.

So I need to compare the energy difference of a vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) and the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1, or J=1 to J=2? Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy. For rotation, the ground state is J=0. So the next higher rotational state would be J=1. Let's calculate both energy differences.

The energy of a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 would be delta E_vib = E_v(1) - E_v(0) = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w.

For rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, delta E_rot = E_J(1) - E_J(0) = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B. And from J=1 to J=2, delta E_rot would be E_J(2) - E_J(1) = B*2*3 - B*1*2 = 6B - 2B =4B.

So comparing
