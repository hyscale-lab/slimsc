Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

So, initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 = 1, and 1 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but I should double-check. Yeah, because 20 mL added to 20 mL makes 40 mL total. So yes, 0.025 M is correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Right?

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So to find the volume needed at equivalence point: moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, I need to find the pH at both 25% and equivalence point.

Let me first tackle the 25% point. So, at this point, half of the acetic acid has reacted? No, wait. If the equivalence is 10 cm³, then 2.5 cm³ is 25% of that. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. The acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol, so after reaction: moles of CH3COOH remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed are 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the total volume at 25% titration is the initial acetic acid volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but when doing dilution, sometimes people neglect minor changes, but perhaps I should include it.

Alternatively, maybe using the buffer equation would be better. Because at 25% titration, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base.
