Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, each as ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector of operators (like P_x, P_y, P_z) with the direction vector n.

So, operator P should be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, since the direction n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component n_y would be zero. So P simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says the direction is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So n could be, say, making an angle θ with the z-axis, and φ would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. So n_x would be sinθ, n_z would be cosθ, and n_y is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or π/2? Wait, x-z plane means that the projection onto the y-axis is zero. So any direction in x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but the general case would have the direction vector as (something, 0, something). So n_y would be zero, and n_x and n_z are non-zero. So the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z), right? With the condition that n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P would be n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but P is an operator, so it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me first write out the expressions for each component.

Given:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So when I construct P, it'll be a combination of these. Let me write out the matrix for P.

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (n_z * ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So, the matrix inside is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, wait, let me check the multiplication:

The first part is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] which gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]

The second part is n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] which gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding these two together: [[n_z,
