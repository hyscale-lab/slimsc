Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Sub X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Hmm, I'll break this down. First, let's think about substance X. It incorporates a heavier isotope, which suggests maybe it's something like hydrogen with deuterium or something similar. The fact that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry makes me think it's a common reagent. Possible candidates could be something like lithium, sodium, potassium, or maybe an isotope of hydrogen like deuterium.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently with metals? Maybe something like water or an acid. Oh wait, if X is a metal, then reacting with water could release hydrogen gas. But wait, the reaction releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule has equal n and p, meaning it's probably H2, because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but wait. Wait, no, if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's another gas. Let's think again.

Wait, the gas W has each molecule with same number of protons and neutrons. So, maybe each molecule has, for instance, 1 proton and 1 neutron. That would be deuterium, D2? Or perhaps a molecule where each atom has that property. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, that's not. Wait, maybe it's something like NH3? No, that's N with 7 neutrons and H with 1. Wait, maybe O2? O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons normally. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule. Wait, that's 16 each. So yes, O2 would satisfy the condition where each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. But wait, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each O atom contributes 8, making O2 have 16 of each. So that
