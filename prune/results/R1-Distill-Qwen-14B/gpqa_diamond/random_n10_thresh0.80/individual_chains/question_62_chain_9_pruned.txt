Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The name is a bit complicated. Let's parse it: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring. At position 1, there's a methyl group attached. This methyl group is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group, which is a formyl group (CHO).

So the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a formyl group and a group that's a methyl linked to both cyclohexyl and hydroxy. Wait, maybe I should draw this structure mentally. The cyclohexane has the formyl group on carbon 1. The same carbon also has a methyl group attached, which itself is connected to another cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the methyl is attached to the cyclohexane ring. That methyl has two substituents: a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's a geminal di-substituted methyl. So, on the cyclohexane ring at position 1, there is a CH that is connected to two cyclohexyl groups and an OH? Wait, no. Wait, the group is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the methyl group is attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the methyl is CH2? Or is it CH with two substituents?

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane where at position 1, there's a CH group that's attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and the main cyclohexane. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohex
