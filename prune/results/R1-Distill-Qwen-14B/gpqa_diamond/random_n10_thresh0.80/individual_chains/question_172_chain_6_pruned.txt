Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and thermal equilibrium. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, 1.38e-23 J is the same as k_B (Boltzmann constant) multiplied by a temperature, because k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So, the energy difference delta E is k_B * T, where T is the temperature? Wait no, wait a minute. Wait, delta E is equal to k_B multiplied by the temperature difference? Or is it something else...

Wait, no. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k_B T) ). Assuming they're in LTE, which the problem states, so local thermal equilibrium applies.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call E2 the higher energy level and E1 the lower. So for star 1 and 2, the populations are in a certain ratio.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. I think that means the population of the higher energy level (E2) relative to the lower (E1) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 is let's say 2 times that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Each star has their own temperature, T1 and T2. So for each star, the ratio is:

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - delta_E / (k_B T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition in iron), then the ratio simplifies to exp( - delta_E/(k_B T) ).

Wait, but delta_E is fixed. Oh, right, because the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k_B multiplied by 1 K. Because k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K, so delta_E = 1.38e-23 J = k_B * 1 K. So delta_E/(k_B T) = (k_B * 1 K) / (k_B T) ) = 1 / T.

So delta_E/(k_B T) = 1/T.

So the ratio (n2/n1) for each star is proportional to exp(-1/T).

Wait, no. Because delta_E is E2 - E1, so when we write (E2 - E1)/(k_B T) that's positive. So the ratio is exp( - (E2-E1)/(k_B T) ), which is exp(-1/T) as delta_E is 1 K in terms of k_B.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Since delta_E = E2 - E1 = k_B * 1 K, then delta_E/(k_B T) = (k_B * 1 K) / (k_B T) ) = 1 K / T. So it's 1/(T), but in Kelvin.

So for each star, the ratio is exp( - 1/(T) ), but wait that can't be right because units don't quite match. Wait, no. Because 1 K is 1 K, so 1/(T) is unitless. So the exponent is unitless, which is correct.

So for star 1, ratio is exp(-1/T1), and for star 2, exp(-1/T2).

But the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in the specific energy level. So I think that (n2_1)/(n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2)/(n1_2).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the excitation level is twice as much, so the population of the excited state (E2) is twice that of the lower state (E1) in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no. Let me read it again. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Oh, maybe it's that the fraction in the excited state is twice. So the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So:

(n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2

But each (n2/n1) is exp( - delta_E/(k_B T) )

Which is exp( -(k_B * T_0) / (k_B T) ) ), where T_0 is 1 K. So that's exp( - T_0 / T ), which is exp( -1/T )

Wait, no, because delta_E is 1.38e-23 J, which is k_B * 1 K. So delta_E/(k_B T) = (k_B * 1 K) / (k_B T) ) = 1/(T). So the ratio is exp(-1/T).

So (n2/n1)_1 = exp( -1/T1 )

Similarly, (n2/n1)_2 = exp( -1/T2 )

Given (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Substituting, exp( -1/T1 ) = 2 * exp( -1/T2 )

Let me write that equation:

exp( -1/T1 ) = 2 * exp( -1/T2 )

Taking natural log on both sides:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + (-1/T2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/T1 = -ln(2) + 1/T2

Wait, no: wait, ln(exp(a))=a. So, we have:

ln( exp( -1/T1 )) = ln( 2 * exp( -1/T2 ) )

Which becomes:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + (-1/T2 )

Which rearranges to:

1/T1 =
