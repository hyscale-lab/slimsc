Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about mass in any of the calculations here.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D with various values.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in a system, they have potential energy associated with their configuration. Since the system is isolated, the energy is conserved, and the minimum energy would be when the system is in a stable configuration, perhaps when all the charges are as close as possible or arranged in a certain way.

Wait, but in this case, twelve charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the thirteenth is fixed at P. So, the setup is like a central charge (fixed) with twelve others around it at radius 2 meters.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2e and located 2 meters away.

So, the potential energy of the system would come from the interactions between the fixed
