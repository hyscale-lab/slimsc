Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and stability constants? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio, forming a complex. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable that complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable and less likely to dissociate.

So, the complex here is Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. The formation reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.

But wait, in solution, the complex exists, and the concentration given is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex. I'm supposed to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Stability constant K is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. But what's the concentration of free EDTA and Ca²+?

Wait, I think that when EDTA is in solution, it can exist in different protonated forms. But the problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y^4−), so I don't need to consider the various protonation states. That's a relief because otherwise, the problem would get a lot more complicated.

So, assuming that the pH is such that EDTA is entirely Y^4−, the solution is just dealing with Y^4− and the complex.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 minus the amount that dissociates. But wait, because K is very large (5e10), the dissociation should be very small. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA will be very low, but we can perhaps approximate.

Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, the complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So the expression for K is:

K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²)

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that again.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) → 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 1e-7. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7 on a log scale, so about 3.16e-7.

So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, so [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

That makes sense because K is very large, so the dissociation is minimal, and the free Ca²+ is very low.

Wait, wait, am I missing any other factors? Oh, right, the problem might have considered that EDTA is present in excess, but in this case, the initial solution is only the complex. So, the only source of EDTA is the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, then the concentrations are as I thought earlier. So the product [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] is x², and the complex is 0.02 M.

So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \)). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

The stability constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
