Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other reactions affecting the EDTA. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so that's probably fine. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Hmm, wait, is that the formation constant or something else?

Oh right, the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, maybe it's a 1:1 complex here.

Let me write the expression for Kf. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, all the Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would have come from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, without dissociation, [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be zero. But when the complex dissociates a little, each mole of CaEDTA^2− produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

So let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ (and EDTA^4−) at equilibrium. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, actually, the initial concentration is the complex, 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, each mole of the complex gives a mole of Ca²+ and a mole of EDTA^4−. So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x

But Kf is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the dissociation should be very small. So x should be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would make the math easier.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / (x²) = 5e10

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13? Wait, wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, why is x the concentration of Ca²+? Because each mole of the complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one of EDTA. So yes, [Ca²+] = x, which in this case is about 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\),

where \(x\) is the concentration of dissociated calcium ions and EDTA ligands. Substituting these into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[CaEDTA^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Since \(K_f\) is very large (\(5 \times 10^{10}\)), the dissociation is minimal, and \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). Solving for \(x\):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
