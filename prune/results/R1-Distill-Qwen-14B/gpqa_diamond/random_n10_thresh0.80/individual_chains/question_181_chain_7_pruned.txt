Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions continued as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

Hmm, first, I remember that the pp-III chain is part of the proton-proton cycle in the Sun's fusion. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, right? Like, the main neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-III process. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of those high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions are as before. So the pp-I and pp-II branches, and any other reactions that aren't pp-III, continue. So maybe the pp-I and pp-II produce lower-energy neutrinos?

I think the pp-III chain produces the highest-energy neutrinos. Because in the pp-I, you get more like lower-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos would decrease, but lower-energy might stay the same.

So the question is about two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. I think the pp-III neutrinos are in the higher energy ranges. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be affected more than band 1 (700-800). Wait, but what's the main source of neutrinos in these bands?

Wait, the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp-III process. Because the other processes contribute less. So if pp-III stops, the total neutrino flux would drop, but in which energy bands?

Wait, no, the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) produce lower-energy neutrinos. So the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy ranges. So band 2 is higher than band 1.

So if pp-III stops,
