Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c. The nucleus X is described as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to work through this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium, right? The isotopes of lithium have different numbers of neutrons. So, Li with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6 because the atomic number (protons) is 3 for lithium. So, the mass number A is 3 +3 =6. So, the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider relates to its kinetic energy, but since we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light (0.96c is pretty fast), relativistic effects are definitely important here. So, we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to use special relativity.

The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. Wait, no, the question says the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain kinetic energy, which would be part of the total energy. But I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the energy we usually talk about in colliders is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic)? I think in collider physics, when they say the energy, they usually mean the kinetic energy. Or maybe sometimes the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So, RHIC is the collider, and it imparts energy to the ions. So I think they're referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Or perhaps the total energy (gamma times m c^2). Let's think about how to approach this.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So, the first step is to find the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate v = 0.96c.

So, v = 0.96c. Let me compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Calculate (0
