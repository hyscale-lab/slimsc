Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities and how they compare.

First, the given information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So if Star_2's radius is R, Star_1's is 1.5R. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh wait, but wait—luminosity of a star is primarily related to its radius and temperature, right? Because the formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, because L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That's the peak wavelength due to black body radiation, which is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that implies their temperatures T are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T_1 equals T_2.

Wait, but wait, if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity would depend only on radius. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T is same, L is proportional to R squared. So Star_1's radius is 1.5 times, so L1 is (1.5)^2 times L2. Which would make L1/L2 = 2.25. So that's option A.

Wait but wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, how does that affect the calculation? Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But in terms of observed quantities, like the wavelength of the star's spectrum, which is peak wavelength, the Doppler effect comes into play.

Oh wait, right! If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; if moving away, redshifted. The peak wavelength we observe would be affected by the star's velocity. So the observed peak wavelength λ_observed is related to the rest frame λ_emit (which is given by Wien
