Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to the axis.

Looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think I should analyze each option to see if any have C3h symmetry.

Starting with option D, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. I remember it's a norbornane derivative. The structure has a seven-membered ring, but wait, I'm not sure about its symmetry. Quinuclidine has a chair-like structure, maybe with some kind of three-fold symmetry? Or perhaps it has a three-fold axis because of the bridge. Let me visualize it. No, wait, norbornane has a bridge with two carbons on each bridge end. Quinuclidine has a bridgehead and perhaps a three-fold axis. Or maybe it's more like a three-membered ring, but I'm not confident. I think quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry because the molecule is symmetric when you rotate it 120 degrees. Does it also have a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Maybe it's C3 but without the mirror plane, so it wouldn't be C3h. Or perhaps it's another type of symmetry.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. The structure is a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is symmetric. So imagine a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. Each isopropyl is like a CH(CH3)2 group. So when you rotate the molecule by 120 degrees around the boron, each isopropyl moves to the next position. That suggests a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, considering the structure, if the B is in the center and the isopropyls are symmetric, then a horizontal plane cutting through the boron might work. Wait, but a mirror plane would require symmetry in a plane. So yes, the molecule should have C3h symmetry. Because each isopropyl is the same, and the structure is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation and has a mirror plane. So triisopropyl borate is a candidate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. So for C3h, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. Or wait, no, the σh is a horizontal mirror plane, which lies in the same plane as the rotation axis. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check the definitions.

Wait, the C3h point group includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the C3 axis is perpendicular to the σh plane. So when you rotate about the C3 axis, you get the same structure, and the σh plane is a mirror plane. So in triisopropylborate, the boron is the center with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically. So if the molecule is flat—like all the isopropyl groups are in the same plane as the boron, then a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. Wait, but the isopropyl groups are three-dimensional. Each is CH2CH(CH3)2, so they are not flat. So maybe the molecule is trigonal pyramidal? No, because each isopropyl is attached to B, which is in a trigonal planar geometry. Wait, no, B usually has a trigonal planar arrangement when bonded to three groups. So if all three substituents are identical, like three isopropyl groups, then the molecule is symmetric under 120-degree rotation. But would it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Let me think about the structure. Each isopropyl is attached to B, which is in the center. So from the top, looking down the C3 axis (which is through the B), you see three identical groups. A σh plane would be a plane that cuts through the B and one of the isopropyl groups. Wait, but each isopropyl is a three-dimensional structure. So would such a mirror plane exist? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the plane is cutting through the B and bisecting the angles between the substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Triisopropylborane is a trigonal planar molecule. Each isopropyl is a bulky group. The symmetry here is such that if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. So that's the C3 part. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Let's imagine a plane that goes through the B atom and one of the isopropyl groups. Wait, because each isopropyl is symmetric, a plane cutting through the B and one isopropyl would map the adjacent isopropyls onto each other. So yes, there's a mirror plane. So if the molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane, then it's C3h. So triisopropylborate would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Because each isopropyl group is a three-dimensional structure. So the mirror plane would reflect each isopropyl onto another. But each isopropyl is symmetrical on its own, so any plane that bisects the molecule would reflect the substituents correctly. Hence, the molecule should have both a C3 and a σh, making it C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has C3v symmetry instead. C3v has a C3 axis and vertical mirror planes. Wait, but C3h is different. I think I need to correct my understanding.

Wait, the point groups: C3h has a horizontal mirror plane. So the h in the notation refers to the orientation of the mirror plane relative to the rotation axis. In C3h, the σh is a horizontal plane, meaning it's perpendicular to the C3 axis. Or wait, no—I think the h refers to horizontal, which is a plane parallel to the base of the point group's representation. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the standard point group table.

Looking up, the C3h point group consists of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The combination leads to certain symmetry elements.

Alternatively, triisopropylborate is a trigonal planar molecule, which has a C3 axis and three mirror planes (each along one of the substituents). But that would be C3v symmetry, not C3h. Because C3v has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (each bisecting the angle between substituents). So maybe triisopropylborate has C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This sounds like a benzofused trifuran with multiple ketone groups. The numbering suggests that the benzene is fused with the furan rings. So the structure would have a benzene ring connected to three furan rings in a certain way. I'm not exactly sure of the structure, but such a molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's something like benzene fused to three furan rings arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a mirror plane or a higher symmetry.

Alternatively, if the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around the benzene, maybe the molecule has a three-fold axis. But I'm not certain. Without seeing the structure, it's tough to tell.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

This name suggests that a triphenylene (a fused tricyclic benzene system) is connected to a trifuran, perhaps at three different positions. Triphenylene has a three-fold symmetry, I think. Because it's a tricyclic compound where three benzene rings are fused in a symmetric way. So the triphenylene part itself would have C3 symmetry. If the trifuran is attached symmetrically, then the entire molecule might have C3 symmetry, but perhaps not C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge. The structure is similar to norbornane, but with two methyl groups or something else? Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. So it's a molecule with three bridges, each of two carbons. So the structure looks like a triangle, with each corner connected by two carbons. This arrangement gives it a high degree of symmetry. Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of rotation. Because each bridge is the same, rotating 120 degrees would leave the structure unchanged. But does it have a mirror plane? Since it's a flat structure? Hmm, no, it's a three-dimensional structure. Wait, is there a plane that can act as a mirror? Because the molecule is symmetric in such a way that any plane passing through the center and a carbon would reflect onto another, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. If that's the case, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane.

Alternatively, quinuclidine may have a C3 axis and a σh plane. So, if you imagine rotating it 120 degrees about the C3 axis, and then looking at the structure, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Wait, the molecule is somewhat flat, so perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

I recall that triphenylene has a three-fold symmetry but maybe without the mirror plane. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way. But when it's attached to other groups, like in option A, whether it would have C3h depends on the substituents.

Option C is triisopropylborate. As I thought earlier, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, then it's C3h. But earlier I was confused about whether it actually has a σh.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropylborate has a higher symmetry. Another angle: the point group of triisopropylborane. I think triisopropylborane (which is triisopropyl borane, not borate) is known to have a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (C3v symmetry), not C3h. Because the substituents are arranged trigonal planar, each with their own mirror plane.

Wait, but the question is about C3h, which includes a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps C3v is different. So if triisopropylborate has C3v, then it wouldn't be C3h. Thus, option C might not be the correct answer.

Another option is option D, quinuclidine. If quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a σh plane, then it would be C3h. I'm trying to think about the structure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. So it has a bridge on each side. If I imagine looking along the three-fold axis, each bridge is the same. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Because the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps a plane that bisects the molecule through the center and a bridge would act as a mirror. But wait, the molecule is symmetric in three dimensions, so perhaps it does have a mirror plane that is horizontal relative to the C3 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that when you look at it along the C3 axis, you can see a mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe another approach: think about the number of symmetry elements each point group has. C3h has a C3, a σh, and several other elements generated by them. So the presence of a C3 and a σh is essential.

If triisopropylborate has a C3 and σh, then it's C3h. But I'm unsure.

Wait, another thought: triisopropylborate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So if the molecule is flat, and the mirror plane is along one of the substituents, that would make it σv (vertical). But if the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, that would be σh. Wait, perhaps the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So if the C3 axis is along the boron and the substituents are in the plane, then a horizontal plane would cut through the boron, but that's not possible because the substituents are in the same plane as the boron. So any horizontal plane would need to be perpendicular to the C3 axis. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Maybe I should think about which of the options is a known C3h molecule. I think triphenylene has C3v symmetry because it has a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes. But when it's part of a larger molecule, like in option A, maybe it's attached in a way that introduces a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, the other options:

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Benzo fused to trifuran—so the structure has a benzene ring fused to three furan rings, perhaps in a symmetric arrangement. The molecule might have a center of symmetry or a mirror plane. Let's say the benzene is at the center, and the three furans are attached symmetrically. That could lead to a C3 axis. But I'm not sure about the mirror plane.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric under 120-degree rotation and has a mirror plane, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C2 axis and some other symmetries.

But I'm not confident. Let's think again about each option.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings fused in a symmetric way. If this is connected to a trifuran in a symmetric way, perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Here, the benzo is fused to a trifuran, which is a structure with three furan rings. The benzo part is a benzene ring, and the trifuran is connected at certain positions. The numbering suggests that the fusions are symmetrical. So the molecule might have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Option D: quinuclidine.

Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and possibly a mirror plane. If it has both, then it's C3h.

Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me imagine the structure. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a very symmetric molecule. It looks like a triangle with three bridges. If you look along the three-fold axis (down the center of the triangle), you can see three identical bridge structures. So a 120-degree rotation would leave it unchanged. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because the molecule is symmetrical across planes that pass through each bridge. So each bridge is symmetrical, and those planes would act as mirror planes. Wait, but I'm not sure if those are considered horizontal mirror planes relative to the C3 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane but has vertical ones. If that's the case, then its point group would be C3v, not C3h.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of specific examples. For instance, water has C2v symmetry, ammonia has C3v, and formaldehyde has C2h.

Wait, I'm confusing some point groups. Let's think: benzene has D6h symmetry, which is higher than C3h. So perhaps quinuclidine is C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Wait, what about triisopropylborate? If it's C3v, then it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. So it wouldn't be C3h.

So none of the options except perhaps option A or B have the symmetry.

Wait, let me think about option B again. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The structure is a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a way that each furan is attached to the benzene. The way the fusions are arranged might result in a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, if the benzene is at the center, and each of the three furan rings is attached at 120-degree intervals, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. But whether it has a horizontal mirror plane, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then its point group is C3h. Which of the options likely have that?

Alternatively, I think option A is a triphenylene connected to a trifuran. Triphenylene itself has a three-fold axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. If the trifuran is attached in a way that maintains the mirror plane, then perhaps the entire molecule has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because the benzo is fused to the trifuran in a way that creates three-fold symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of rings. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran would have a benzene ring fused to three furan rings, each attached at different positions. The numbering suggests that the fusions are symmetric. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm getting stuck between options B and D.

Wait, another approach: quinuclidine's structure. It has three bridgeheads arranged in a triangle, each connected via two carbons. So the molecule has a three-fold axis, but does it have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because each bridge is identical. So if you place a mirror plane through one bridge, it would reflect the other two bridges correctly. So that would be a vertical mirror plane, not horizontal. Therefore, its point group would be C3v, not C3h.

So, C3v symmetry has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes. So quinuclidine would have C3v, not C3h. Therefore, it's not the correct answer.

Then, triisopropylborate, which I thought might have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So that leaves options A and B. Which one has C3h symmetry?

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, so it has three-fold symmetry. If this is connected to a trifuran, perhaps the entire structure has C3h.

Alternatively, option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

If the benzo is symmetrically attached to the trifuran, perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option B. Because the benzo is fused to the trifuran in a way that creates a three-fold symmetry and a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's option A.

Another point: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane in the molecule. For C3h, the molecule should have a horizontal mirror plane. So which of these structures would have that.

Wait, if I imagine the benzo ring as the base, then a horizontal mirror plane could be along the plane of the benzo ring, acting as a mirror. That could give the molecule C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps option B has a mirror plane through the benzene ring, which is horizontal relative to the C3 axis.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm not very confident. Maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, earlier I thought that triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry because it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents. But if the substituents are such that a horizontal mirror plane exists, then it's C3h.

Wait, but the substituents are isopropyl groups, which are themselves symmetric. So, for each isopropyl group, a mirror plane exists through the central carbon and the middle of the CH2 groups. So, when you have three such groups in a trigonal planar arrangement, the molecule has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (C3v), not C3h.

Therefore, option C has C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So, the only option left is either A or B.

Wait, another thought: the molecule in option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The benzo part is a benzene ring, and the trifuran suggests three furan rings attached. The way it's fused might create a structure where the benzene ring is in a plane, and the three furan rings are attached symmetrically in a way that the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

If the benzene is the base, then a horizontal mirror plane would lie along the benzene's plane. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another possibility: the molecule in option A is triphenyleno, which is a tricyclic system with a three-fold axis, connected to a trifuran. So, perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

I think I'm not getting any further, so I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given all this, I think option B is the correct answer. Because the benzo is fused to the trifuran in a way that creates a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The analysis for each option is as follows:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system with three-fold symmetry (C₃). 
- The molecule is fused with a trifuran system, which is symmetrically attached.
- The overall structure likely retains the three-fold axis (C₃) from triphenylene. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is unclear due to the fused trifuran system.
- **Conclusion**: It is uncertain whether this molecule has C₃h symmetry.

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- The structure consists of a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system in a symmetric arrangement.
- The benzene ring is at the center, and the three furan rings are attached at 120° intervals, creating a three-fold rotation axis (C₃).
- A horizontal mirror plane (σh) likely exists along the plane of the benzene ring, which is perpendicular to the C₃ axis.
- **Conclusion**: This molecule has both a C₃ axis and a σh plane, making it a candidate for C₃h symmetry.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement.
- The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the three isopropyl groups.
- However, the isopropyl groups are three-dimensional, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is unlikely because the substituents are not flat or symmetric in a way that would allow such a plane.
- **Conclusion**: This molecule has C₃v symmetry (C₃ axis and vertical mirror planes), not C₃h.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to its symmetric bridge structure.
- The molecule has vertical mirror planes (C₃v symmetry), but a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is not present.
- **Conclusion**: This molecule has C₃v symmetry, not C₃h.

---

### **Final Answer**
Based on the analysis, **Option B** (benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone) is the most likely candidate for having C₃h symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

**Answer: B**
