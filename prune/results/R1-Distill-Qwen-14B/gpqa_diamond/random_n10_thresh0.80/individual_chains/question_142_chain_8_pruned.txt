Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about a density matrix and its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, that looks familiar. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, this ρ is a 2x2 matrix because it's dealing with qubits.

Let me write out what this matrix looks like. I know that |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. So when I add them together, I get a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 makes each diagonal element 1/2. So ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Oh wait, that's the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ = (I)/2, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what this 'geometrical position' refers to. I think this might be in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit can be represented as a point on a unit sphere.

But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. Pure states are represented as points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. So, the given ρ is a mixed state because it's a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2.

The density matrix for a mixed state of the basis states can be written as ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|, where p is between 0 and 1. In our case, p is 1/2, so it's an equal mixture.

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the points (0,0
