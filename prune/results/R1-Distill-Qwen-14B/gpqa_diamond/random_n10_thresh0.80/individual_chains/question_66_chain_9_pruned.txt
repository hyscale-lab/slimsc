Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT again? I remember it's a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators to parameterize beyond the SM physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

All right, so SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, but it's constructed to preserve certain symmetries, right? Because effective theories usually try to respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. So what symmetries are preserved?

I think the SMEFT operators are built to maintain gauge symmetry, like the SM's SU(2) and U(1) etc. But the question is about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

So, let's break down the options. The options are 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare, 3. CP, 4. CPT.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, right? So if you have Poincare, Lorentz is included. But do the SMEFT operators require Poincare symmetry?

Hmm, well, the SM itself is a Poincare-invariant theory. Effective theories usually inherit the symmetries of the original theory. So SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So if option 2 is correct, then 1 must also be correct because Lorentz is part of Poincare. But wait, are all operators in SMEFT required to respect every aspect of Poincare?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz transformations but also shifts in spacetime (translations). So if an operator doesn't respect translations, it wouldn't be Poincare symmetric. But SMEFT is built in such a way that the operators are local, right?

Wait, no, the SMEFT operators are local. So they should respect translations, because the theory is set in a smooth spacetime background, implying translation invariance. So the operators must be Lorentz scalars, otherwise, they would not form a Lore
