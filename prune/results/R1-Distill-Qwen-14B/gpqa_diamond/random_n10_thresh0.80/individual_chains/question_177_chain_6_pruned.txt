Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius that's 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Similarly, Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. 

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about stars emitting most intensely at a certain wavelength, which depends on their temperature. Oh right, that's Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength where a star's emission is strongest is inversely proportional to its temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. So T1 equals T2.

But wait, if their temperatures are the same, how does that affect their luminosities? Because I also remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity (or power) to the radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So let's get the data straight:
- R1 = 1.5 * R2
- M1 = 1.5 * M2
- λ_max1 = λ_max2 → T1 = T2

Oh, but wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor we need to find. So using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, (T1/T2)^4 = 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which would make the answer option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, what's that about? Did I miss something? Because in the part where they compute the luminosity, the radial velocity might come into play. But how?

Well, when calculating luminosity, maybe they're using the Doppler shift to find the actual temperature? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength shifts. But wait, in the problem, the peak wavelengths were the same, but that was after considering the Doppler shift? Or before?

Wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. But if a star is moving, its spectrum is Doppler shifted. So the observed wavelength maximum would be different. So perhaps the calculation of the temperature is affected by this?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the intrinsic peak wavelengths (i.e., rest wavelengths) before any Doppler shift. Let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its wavelength would be blueshifted. So the observed wavelength maximum would be shorter than its intrinsic one. But Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is at its intrinsic maximum.

Wait
