Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is this chelating agent that binds metal ions. So the complex is Ca-EDTA, and the K for this complex is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the concentration of the free metal ions can be calculated using the formation constant, K. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex.

So the reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Right, because EDTA has a charge of -4 and calcium is +2, so the complex would have a charge of -2, but wait, maybe it's CaEDTA^2-? Or does the overall charge matter for the calculation? Maybe not directly. 

The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Since the K is very large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA would be y. But wait, considering the stoichiometry. The complex is 1:1, right? So each mole of Ca-EDTA complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- when it dissociates.

Wait no, in solution, the complex might not dissociate much because K is so large. So the assumption is that the dissociation is minimal, so x and y are approximately zero. But wait, because K is so big, the complex is so stable that the dissociation is negligible, meaning that the majority of the complex remains intact. So the free Ca²+ and EDTA concentrations are both very small.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Hmm, stoichiometric... Oh maybe that means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are just right so that they form the complex without any excess. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects this calculation. Maybe it's just another way of saying that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and nothing else is present in excess.

But let's get back to the problem. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let’s say that the complex dissociates slightly into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the change would be, let’s let the change be x. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because K is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, because the reaction is 1:1, so for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, EDTA is usually in a different form depending on the pH. Oh, the question says the pH is ideal. So I can assume that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form for complexation. So I don't have to worry about the different species of EDTA; it's all present as EDTA^4-.

So then, plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We know K is 5e10, [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M because x is negligible.

So:

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² ≈ 0.02 / 5e10 → x² ≈ 4e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) → 2e-6.5 → which is approximately 6.3e-7 because 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is about 6.3e-7.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any wrong assumptions? Let me double-check. I assumed that [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x. That should be correct because for every x moles of complex that dissociate, you get x moles of each ion. Also, I considered that the complex is 0.02 M initially, and that the dissociation is negligible, so [CaEDTA] is effectively 0.02 M.

Another way to think about it is that the formation constant K is so large that the concentration of the complex is almost entirely formed, meaning that the free [Ca²+] is very low, which matches our calculation.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal (due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) remains approximately \(0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result to the options, the correct answer is:
