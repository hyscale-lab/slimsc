Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. I remember from my studies that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of energy levels changes with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of n1 to n2, or the other way around? Let me check the question again. It says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. So that would be n1/n2. 

Wait, no, the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots (lower Teff), the ratio n1/n2 goes down. Hmm. So without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and with spots, it's 5500 K.

So let's think. If the temperature decreases, how does the ratio of n1 to n2 change? Let's think about the Boltzmann equation for n1/n2.

Rearranging the Boltzmann equation:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 would be the reciprocal, so:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponential term is positive. So as T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponential larger. So n1/n2 would increase. Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases? That doesn't fit with my initial analysis. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Let's suppose that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the Teff is 5500 K. So T decreases.

Given the Boltzmann equation, higher energy levels are less populated at lower temperatures. So if the temperature goes down, the ratio of lower energy level (n1) to higher (n2) should increase, because at lower T, more atoms are in the lower energy levels.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which implies that when T goes down, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. That's the opposite of what I just thought. So perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, let me re-read. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2—so that's n1/n2. So when does this ratio decrease? When n1 decreases relative to n2. So if the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, that would mean that n1 is dropping compared to n2 as T decreases, which would imply that n2 is increasing more than n1.

But that doesn't make sense because higher energy levels (n2) are less populated at lower T. So perhaps I have an error in how I'm thinking about this.

Alternatively, maybe the transition corresponds to a particular wavelength, which is given as 1448 Å. Oh, wait, that's in the ultraviolet range. Because 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is UV.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two levels is given by the wavelength. We can calculate the energy difference using the relation E = hc/λ.

So E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Hmm, but that's a very small energy. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So E ≈ (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. But 1448 Å is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the near-UV. The ionization energy of Ti is around 7.1 eV, but neutral Ti would have a higher ionization potential. Wait, but that's about the transition energy. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 6000 K is the effective temperature when the star isn't spotted. When it's spotted, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

But wait, the spots are cooler regions. So the star's overall photosphere is being mixed with cooler regions. But the effective temperature is an average. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K.

Wait, but how does that affect the photospheric temperature? Because the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. Luminosity is proportional to Teff^4 * surface area. So when 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, the overall Teff would change.

But perhaps for this problem, the important thing is the temperature of the photosphere—wait, no, the Teff is given, so perhaps I should use that for the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but the star has a non
