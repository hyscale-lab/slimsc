Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. Let me jot down what I remember.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So the crystal is a rhombohedral structure with all angles equal.

Wait, I think in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a distorted cube. All edges are of equal length, but the angles between them can vary. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, which is pretty sharp—so the unit cell is quite compressed.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the unit cell edge. So that would be the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. The interatomic distance in a crystal can sometimes refer to something else, like the nearest neighbor distance. Oh, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. But in other structures, like fcc or hcp, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2 or something else. So I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom." In a rhombohedral crystal, if it's a primitive unit cell, the atoms are at the corners. But rhombohedral can be part of more complex systems. Hmm, but maybe in this case, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So a = 10 A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. In a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner, and the nearest neighbor distance is a, so the interatomic distance is a. But in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals, so the interatomic distance is a√2 / 2 ≈ 0.707a. So in this problem, if the crystal is a simple cubic, then a is 10. But if it's a more complex structure, like fcc or hcp, the interatomic distance would be different.

Wait, the problem
