Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group because that's where O-H stretches usually appear. Oh wait, but sometimes that could also be N-H, but the other peaks might help clarify. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a region for carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, maybe esters. The 1650 is lower, so perhaps conjugated carbonyls or something else. Oh wait, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Because the 1650 might correspond to a C=O that's conjugated with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there are double bonds, so the molecule has some unsaturated bonds. So maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But the presence of vinyl protons suggests maybe an unsaturated group, like a double bond adjacent to something else.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I've heard that 45 is a common fragment, like for a ketone (propan-2-one, (CH3)2CO, which is 58, but maybe when it fragments, it breaks into smaller bits). Wait, 45 is a molecular ion for something else. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2CO, but wait, that's 58. Oh, wait, maybe it's the fragment of something else. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular ion for perhaps (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15*3 + 12*2 + 1*6? Wait, wait: molecular formula for (CH3)2O is C2H6O, so molecular weight is (12*2) + (6*1) + (16) = 24 +6+16=46. Oh, so that's 46. So maybe 45 is a different fragment.

Wait, another common fragment is the CH3CO group. Let's see: CH3CO is 43, but wait, maybe in some cases, it's the loss of something else. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the tropylium ion? Or maybe the fragment is from a ketone. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to the fragment after losing a water molecule or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's the fragment of a cyclic ether or something else.

Wait, 45 as a molecular ion could be C3H7O. Let me calculate that. C3 is 36, H7 is 7, O is 16. So 36 + 7 +16 = 60? No, wait, wait. Wait, molecular formula for a fragment of 45 could be C3H3O. Let's calculate that
