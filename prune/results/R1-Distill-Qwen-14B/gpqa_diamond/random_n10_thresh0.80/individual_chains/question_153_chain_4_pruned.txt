Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a different Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and ethanol as the conditions. So, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's an activated enolate. The acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's a good Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. Dimethyl malonate's enolate would have negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the acceptor, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, the nucleophile (enolate) adds to the beta carbon, and the carbonyl becomes an enolate as well.

So, after the addition, the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's alpha carbon and the acceptor's beta carbon. The structure would be something like a longer chain with two ester groups from the malonate and the p-tolyl group from the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. The acceptor is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (but with the substituent at the E position, but the geometry might not affect the product structure here). So when the enolate attacks, the structure would combine. The product would have the two ester groups from malonate attached to the new position.

So the product A would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me visualize: the malonate (CH2(CO2Me)2) adds to the acrylate (CH2=CH-CO-OCH3). The attack would be on the CH2=CH- part. So the product would have the structure (CO2Me)2C-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the actual addition.

Wait, the Michael addition typically forms a new double bond. When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, the product would have the structure where the malonate's alpha and beta carbons add to the alpha and beta carbons of the acrylate.

Wait, actually, the Michael donor is the enolate. So dimethyl malonate would lose a base to form the enolate, which attacks the acceptor. So the product after the addition would have the malonate's carbon attached to the acrylate's structure.

Wait, perhaps the product will have three ester groups because dimethyl malonate contributes two, and the acrylate has one. So the product would be a tricarboxylate ester. So the structure would be something like MeOOC-CH2-CO-OCH2-CO2Me? Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think again.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH2(CO2Me)2). The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of the acceptor is (Z) would be CH2=CHCO2Me, but in this case, it's the E isomer. Anyway, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the CH2 maybe? Wait, wait no: The acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. So it's CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R, so 3-(p-tolyl) would imply the substituent is on the third carbon, but acrylate is only three carbons: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that's the ester's oxygen connected to a CH2-p-tolyl group? Or maybe the substituent is on the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-O-p-tolyl. But that doesn't fit the description. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl) propenoate. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the CH2 group.

Wait, maybe I should move on and come back. Let's think about the product. After the Michael addition, the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond. So the enolate from the malonate attacks the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) of the acrylate. So the product is formed by adding the malonate's alpha to the acrylate's beta.

So the resulting structure would combine the two. Let's say the acrylate has a structure where the carbonyl is at the end. So the attack would be on the middle carbon of the CH2-CH2 group. So the product would have the malonate's part attached there.

So the product would be a tricarboxylate, because dimethyl malonate contributes two methyl esters and the acrylate contributes one. So the product would be trimethyl something tricarboxylate.

Looking at the options, option A for part A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That sounds plausible.

Moving to part B: The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+ as the conditions. Hmm. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene ring attached. So the structure is piperidine where one of the nitrogen's substituents is a cyclohexene ring (the double bond is between C1 and C2 of cyclohexene).

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Structure: NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CH-CH2-CN. But wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, butenitrile has four carbons. The structure is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, butenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN, but position 2 would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of (E)-but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. Or is it CH3-CH2-CN with a double bond? No, butenitrile is
