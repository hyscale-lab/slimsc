Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars are black bodies and want to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, or is that correct? Oh wait, because λ_max is the same, then according to Wien's law, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. But if the stars have the same temperature, then their luminosity depends on their radius. Because the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since both have the same T, and R1 is 1.5 R2, then L1 = (R1² / R2²) * L2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1 squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which would be option A.

But wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but Star_1 has 0. So does this affect their observed luminosity or the calculation of their luminosity?

Wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So maybe the radial velocity is about the Doppler shift and thus affecting the observed wavelengths. But earlier, it says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's confusing. Because if their actual peak wavelengths are the same (as per T), but if one is moving towards us and the other away, the observed λ_max would shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But the actual λ_max (from their temperature) might be different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The stars have the same observed λ_max. But their actual temperatures might be different because of their velocities. So without considering the velocities, the calculated T would be the same, but with velocities, the actual T could be different.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they are black bodies. So maybe they first correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperature. Or perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual temperatures are different because of their velocities.

Let me break it down.

First, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Let's call this λ_obs. For each star, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), but that's the approximation for non-relativistic speeds. But wait, that's only the linear approximation. The exact relativistic Doppler shift is:

λ_obs / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But wait, velocities: Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so v_r1 = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1. For Star_2, v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's compute this.

But wait, how does this affect the calculation of their temperatures? Because when you observe the star's spectrum, the peak wavelength you measure is λ_obs, which is the Doppler shifted version of the emitted λ_emitted. So if you don't account for the Doppler shift, you might incorrectly calculate the temperature.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So they observe the same λ_max, but that doesn't necessarily mean that their actual temperatures are the same. Because Star_2 is moving towards us (since radial velocity is positive 700 km/s), its emitted wavelength is shorter than what we observe. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. If a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), assuming v << c, this is approximately λ_emitted (1 - v/c). So if the star is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is smaller than the emitted λ_max.

Wait, but in this problem, both observed λ_max are the same. So for Star_1, which has v_r=0, λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1.

For Star_2, which has v_r=700 km/s towards us, so λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But in the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 because the observed wavelengths are the same.

So λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), since λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1 and λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * Doppler factor.

So λ_emitted1 / λ_emitted2 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_emitted is inversely proportional to T. So λ_emitted1 / λ_emitted2 = T2 / T1.

So T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, because λ_emitted1 is larger if T1 is smaller. Wait, λ is inversely proportional to T, so higher T means shorter λ.

Wait, if λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), then since v is positive (700 km/s towards us), (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) is greater than 1. So sqrt of that is greater than 1. So λ_emitted1 is greater than λ_emitted2. Which would imply that T1 is less than T2, since λ is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but how do I relate this to their actual temperatures?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the temperatures based on the observed wavelengths, but considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says that the stars' luminosities are computed assuming they are black bodies. So I think the process is:

1. The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Let's denote it as λ.

2. For each
