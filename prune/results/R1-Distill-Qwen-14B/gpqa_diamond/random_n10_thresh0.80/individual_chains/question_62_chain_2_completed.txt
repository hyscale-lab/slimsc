Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break that down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is a bit long, but I'll try to parse it. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 1 (which I think is the same as the cyclohexyl group), there's a hydroxymethyl group that's also attached to another cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, maybe I should write it out.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring (the main ring) has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and at position 1, there's a substituent. That substituent is a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2-?) Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So it's like the main cyclohexane has a CH2-OH group attached to it, and that same carbon is attached to another cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be:

The main ring is cyclohexane with a CHO group. Then, at position 1 (or another position), there's a carbon attached to two cyclohexyl groups and an OH? No, wait. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, and that CH2 has an OH. So, it's cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the main ring. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is connected to the main cyclohexane ring. So the substituent on the main ring is a CH2OH that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The main molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. Then, on one of the carbons of the main ring, there's a CH2 group that's connected to the cyclohexane (so that's the main ring). That CH2 group has an OH group and is also connected to another cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the main ring has a substituent R where R is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So how do I get from ethynylcyclohexane to that structure?

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. So, the starting material is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond to a CH group.

I need to think about the steps required to introduce the substituents needed.

The target has a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a main ring. Wait, perhaps the target is a bicyclic structure? Or maybe it's just two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH)CH2 group? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about the reagents in the options and see which sequence would make sense.

Looking at the options, they all involve a series of reactions. Let's consider each option step by step. Since all the options start with NaNH2 and some chloride or alcohol, perhaps that's a deprotonation step.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. It's often used in deprotonation reactions, like in the formation of Grignard reagents. But here, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, if we treat that with NaNH2 and a methyl chloride, perhaps it's a alkylation reaction.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne. Treating a terminal alkyne with a base like NaNH2 would deprotonate it, making an acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving a longer alkyne. So, if we start with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), deprotonate to form cyclohexane-C≡^−, then treat with CH3Cl, the alkyne would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that would be propynylcyclohexane? Or maybe it's more like the alkyne is extended.

Wait, perhaps the first step is converting the terminal alkyne into a Grignard-like species, then alkylating. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C-alkylation.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So maybe we need to form a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group with an OH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is made by forming a cyclohexylmethyl group with an OH, then introducing the aldehyde.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring with a triple bond to a CH2 group? Or is it a cyclohexane with a C≡CH attached? So, structure-wise, it's cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So, first step: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 deprotonates the triple bond, forming the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So after step 1, the alkyne is now longer.

Then, step 2 varies between options. Let's look at option C: after step 1, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That sounds like hydrogenation. So, hydrogenating the triple bond would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2, but wait, the triple bond is two carbons. So, if I have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenating would turn it into cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically leads to a single bond. So, triple bond (sp-hybridized carbons) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd) would become a single bond, adding two hydrogens. So, for example, HC≡CCl2 would become HC-CCl2 (but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, ethyne (HC≡CH) upon hydrogenation becomes ethane (CH2CH2?), but that's not possible because that's just ethylene. Oh wait, no: ethyne (HC≡CH) becomes ethane (CH2CH3) when hydrogenated with H2 and catalyst. Wait no, wait: hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane requires dissolving metal reduction, like with Li or Na in NH3. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a palladium catalyst usually stops at the cis-alkene stage. To get the alkane, you need more vigorous conditions or a different catalyst.

So, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, giving a cis-diene? Wait, no, wait. If I have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-C=CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. The triple bond is between the cyclohexyl and the CH3. So after hydrogenation, it becomes a single bond. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would require adding two H2 molecules, but with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's only adding one. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is a hydrogenation that saturates the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, the triple bond (C≡C) would become a single bond (C-C) with two H added. So, the structure would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be because the triple bond is between two carbons. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. After step 1, it's cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, so it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right, because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After the first step (NaNH2 and CH3Cl), the C≡CH becomes C≡C-CH3, so the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Because the triple bond (three bonds) becomes a single bond with two H's added on each carbon.

Wait, but cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 has two carbons in the triple bond. When hydrogenated, each carbon would gain two H's. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that would be a six-membered ring with a propyl group attached. So, cyclohexane attached to CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't make sense because CH2-CH2-CH3 is a three-carbon chain, but the middle carbons would have single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation of the triple bond gives a single bond, so the molecule becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a straight chain, so maybe the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the methyl group. So after hydrogenation, it becomes a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would require adding two H's to each carbon of the triple bond. So, the structure would have a CH2 group between the cyclohexane and the CH2CH3? Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't saturate the triple bond completely. Wait, no, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and usually, it would add H2 across the triple bond. But the question is, does it add two H2 molecules (to go from triple to single) or just one (to go from triple to double)?

Wait, I think that hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically adds H2 once, turning the triple into a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexyl-C=CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, each carbon in the triple bond has two other bonds. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, each of the triple bond carbons adds an H. So the triple bond becomes a double bond. So structure becomes cyclohexyl-C=CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 if fully saturated. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is a hydrogenation that fully saturates the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 (H2/Pd) would add H's across, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would require adding two H's to each carbon of the triple bond, so each C would go from sp to sp3. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but that's a straight chain, which is 1-propylcyclohexane. But then, the next steps would involve oxidizing or something else.

Looking at option C, after step 2, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene breaks it into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but if step 2 converts the triple bond into a single bond, then there's no double bond for ozonolysis. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation but only adds H2 once, turning the triple into a double. So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd would add H to make a double bond. So structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH). Step 1: NaNH2 (a strong base) would deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form cyclohexyl-C≡^−. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Now, in step 2, option C uses H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond. But what happens when you hydrogenate a triple bond with H2 and Pd? Typically, it adds one H2 molecule, turning the triple into a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's not correct because the triple bond has two bonds. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of valency. Each carbon in the triple bond has two other bonds (the cyclohexyl and the CH3). So, when hydrogenated, each would add a hydrogen, making a double bond. So, structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the middle carbon would have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about but-1-yne: HC≡C-CH2-CH3. If I hydrogenate that with H2 and Pd, it becomes butane: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's not possible, because that would be CH3CH2CH2CH3, but with two CH2 groups in the middle. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a single bond upon hydrogenation, adding two H's to each carbon. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's impossible because that would require each carbon in the triple bond to have four bonds, which is impossible. Hmm, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reagents. Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Another possibility is that this is a catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the triple bond to a single bond, adding two H's per carbon. So, each of the two carbons in the triple bond would have two H's added, making them sp3 hybridized. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not possible because that would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't set up the molecule for the next step, which is ozonolysis. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane with a CHO group. The substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed by some kind of substitution or addition.

Another approach: perhaps the initial steps involve forming a Grignard reagent. Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride sounds like it's making a methyl group addition. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, perhaps in the next step, we hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making the molecule cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem to help in forming the target structure.

Wait, maybe after forming the longer alkyne, the next step is different. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 with methanol? That doesn't make sense. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a good nucleophile. Maybe it's deprotonating something. But in the first step, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence starts with forming a Grignard-like reagent. Wait, NaNH2 can deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, adding a methyl group (like CH3Cl) would give a longer alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the target requires the formation of a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So maybe after the alkyne is made longer, we perform some kind of dihydroxylation or epoxidation, but that's not in the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the next step is a reduction. Let's think: after the alkyne is extended, step 2 in option C is hydrogenation. So, if the triple bond becomes a single bond, then the molecule is now cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis (O3 with (CH3)2S as a work-up). Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. But if step 2 made it a single bond, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So that can't be right. So perhaps step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the cis-alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a cis double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-C=CH2-CH3? No, that can't be because the triple bond would become a double bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via some kind of cyclopropanation or other ring-forming steps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps it's made via a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps after forming the longer alkyne, we perform a hydration to form a ketone. But I don't see any such reagents in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves forming a carbonyl group. The target has a carbaldehyde group. So maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation.

Wait, option C's step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would produce diketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the alkyne is turned into a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think again. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH). Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl gives cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3. Suppose this hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis on a single bond doesn't do anything. So that can't be. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the reagent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps step 2 in option C is a hydrogenation that stops at the cis-alkene. So, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 and Pd gives cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense because the triple bond can't become a single bond with a double bond in between without adding more H's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves forming an epoxide or some diol, but I don't see that reagents in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents involve forming a carbonyl group. Let's think: after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 could be a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene, making a cis double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if after step 2, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the two middle carbons, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's imagine that after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to form a carbonyl group. The target has a carbaldehyde group, so maybe an oxidation step is involved.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH, which can be achieved via hydroboration or some kind of addition.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2/methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4/HgSO4/H2O.

So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple to single, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; perhaps it's a Birch reduction or something else. Then, step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is a hydration or oxidation condition, like for a carbonyl.

Not sure.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2/ethyl chloride, Li/liq. NH3, O3/H2O, NH4OH.

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or deprotonation. Step 3: O3/H2O would ozonolyze a double bond, producing carbonyl groups. Step 4: NH4OH would work up the ozonolysis.

Option C: Steps 1. NaNH2/methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-CaCO3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 would hydrogenate triple to single, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: Ozonolysis, which doesn't do anything. So this can't be right. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate fully.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond but does something else. Wait, H2/Pd-CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so it would add H2. But perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, leaving a double bond. So, after step 2, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but if step 2 is H2 and Pd, it would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon. So, maybe the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. But then, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So this doesn't make sense.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2/methanol, Li/liq. NH3, O3/(CH3)2S, NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol... not sure what that does. Methanol is a methylating agent, but in presence of strong base, perhaps it's an O-alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 is used to deprotonate something, and methanol is the methylating agent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a carbonyl group. How do I get a carbonyl from an alkyne?

One method is via oxidation. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can produce diketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, oxidative cleavage of a triple bond would give a diketone. But I'm not sure what reagents do that.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring has a CHO group. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group connected to a cyclohexyl.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent that adds to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. So perhaps the steps are: alkyne → alkyne extended → hydrogenated to alkene → ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Wait, let's think about option C again.

Step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would do nothing because it's a single bond. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Looking at option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl? No, wait, ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide. So, the alkyne would become longer. Wait, no: the acetylide is -C≡^−, adding ethyl chloride would give -C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, Li in NH3 is often used for the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, it's used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. Maybe it's used to deprotonate a compound to form a strong base, which could then eliminate to form a double bond.

So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 could deprotonate, perhaps leading to elimination and forming a double bond. Wait, but the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Deprotonating could lead to a triple bond with adjacent H's, but I'm not sure how that would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Then, step 3: O3/H2O. Ozonolysis of a double bond would cleave it into carbonyl groups. Then, step 4: NH4OH would work up the ozonolysis, perhaps giving aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a substituent with a hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, we get two carbonyl groups, which could then undergo some aldol addition or other condensation to form the target.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the correct sequence.

Another approach: the target has a carbaldehyde group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. How?

One method is to oxidize the alkyne to a diketone. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Wait, another possibility: The alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then the alkene is epoxidized, then opened to form a diol, which is then oxidized. But this seems complicated, and the options don't include such reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Extend the alkyne: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, but none of the options have Lindlar's.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond using H2 and a catalyst, then subjected to ozonolysis.

Wait, let me think: If the triple bond is converted to a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd → cyclohexyl-C=CH2-CH3 (but this structure isn't possible because each carbon in the double bond would have four bonds).

Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the two central carbons. So, structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → but with a double bond between the CH2 and CH3? No, that would require CH2=CH2, which is ethylene. But that's not possible because the cyclohexyl is attached to one end.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct answer.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form a longer alkyne, then hydrogenate it to a diol, and then perform some oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Extend the alkyne: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond (using H2 and a catalyst that stops at the double bond, like Lindlar's catalyst), giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. But none of the options use Lindlar's.

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Work up with a reagent to form the aldehyde.

But looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reagent that leads to aldehydes/ketones without overoxidizing. So, perhaps after ozonolysis, the carbonyl groups are formed.

Wait, let's imagine that after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the middle carbons.

But I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the correct answer.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via hydroboration or some kind of addition to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extension.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination or saponification.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we get a diketone, which upon treatment with Ba(OH)2 (a strong base) undergoes some kind of condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Make the alkyne longer.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond.

3. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Reduce the carbonyl groups to aldehydes or other groups.

But the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the final step is a reductive work-up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring has a CHO group, and a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. For example, if we have a ketone, adding a Grignard reagent would form an alcohol upon protonation.

But how to get the ketone?

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we form a diketone, which can then undergo some aldol condensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond (using H2 and a catalyst that stops at the double bond).

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form aldehydes.

But then, how does that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the other is a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbonyl, which upon reduction gives the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, looking at option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't do anything on single bonds. So that can't be.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq NH3 → perhaps deprotonates to form an organometallic, which then eliminates to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond, producing carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → work-up, perhaps hydrolysis to form aldehydes.

This could result in two carbonyl groups. If the main ring becomes a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the substituent becomes a cyclohexyl with a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → not sure what this does. Maybe deprotonate and methylate something.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps this is formed via an epoxide ring opening, but that's not among the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps after forming a carbonyl group on the main ring, a Grignard reagent is added to form the substituent.

But I'm not getting closer. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The target has an aldehyde group. Ozonolysis can produce aldehydes. So perhaps the correct answer involves ozonolysis as a step.

Looking at the options, options B and C have ozonolysis steps.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O.

Option C: step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S.

The work-up after ozonolysis affects the products. O3/H2O tends to form ketones and carboxylic acids, while (CH3)2S is a milder reductant that forms aldehydes and ketones without overoxidizing.

Since the target has an aldehyde group, perhaps using (CH3)2S is better, as in option C.

So, option C's step 3 uses O3/(CH3)2S, which would form aldehydes.

Putting it all together:

1. NaNH2 and CH3Cl → extend the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then the triple bond is gone, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond. Wait, maybe step 2 is not a hydrogenation but a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that adds H's to the triple bond, making a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis in step 3 would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

So, after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Another thought: after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3: ozonolysis doesn't do anything, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is to hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolyze, but that's not in the options. So perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, option B's step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent. Perhaps in this step, the alkyne is deprotonated and then undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 could deprotonate the alkyne, leading to elimination of HCl (if any) or perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but without any leaving group, elimination might not occur. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form an alkyne with a negative charge, which could then attack something else. Not sure.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond, if any, to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne and then performs O-methylation. But I'm not sure.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonates to form a strong base.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → work-up.

This isn't clear either.

I think I've spent a lot of time and need to make a decision. Based on the reasoning that ozonolysis with (CH3)2S is used to form aldehydes, and the target has an aldehyde group, option C has the correct ozonolysis step. But I'm not fully certain.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the OH is formed via an epoxide ring opening, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the products are a carbaldehyde and a ketone, which could then undergo some kind of addition to form the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → two carbonyls.

4. Reduce one to aldehyde, the other to alcohol.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps option C's steps don't make sense because ozonolysis can't act on a single bond. So perhaps the correct option is B.

I'm getting stuck, but I'll go with option C as the answer.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride extend the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role here is unclear.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O suggests oxidative conditions, but the sequence does not align with forming the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride extend the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O ozonolyses the double bond (if formed) to produce carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH works up the ozonolysis products. This sequence partially aligns with forming carbonyl groups, but the exact formation of the target structure is unclear.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride extend the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S ozonolyses the double bond (if formed) to produce aldehydes and ketones. However, if the triple bond is fully hydrogenated to a single bond, ozonolysis would not act on a single bond, making this sequence inconsistent.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol may deprotonate and methylate, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate, but the role here is ambiguous.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S ozonolyses a double bond (if formed) to produce aldehydes and ketones.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH works up the ozonolysis products. This sequence is unclear in forming the target structure.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a carbaldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Option C includes ozonolysis with (CH₃)₂S, which is suitable for forming aldehydes, but the sequence is inconsistent because ozonolysis cannot act on a single bond. Despite this, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible answer.
