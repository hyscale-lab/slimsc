Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is a bit complex, but let's see. The main part is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO). Then, there's a substituent attached to the cyclohexane ring at the 1-position. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, it looks like there's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group (OH). So, the structure is something like cyclohexane with a CHO group and a CH2 group attached. The CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring and an OH.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me draw it mentally. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the CH2 has a cyclohexyl (another cyclohexane ring) and an OH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group attached? Or maybe the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane on adjacent carbons? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's a single substituent where the CH2 has both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group attached. So, the substituent is -CH2-OH and -CH2-cyclohexyl, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps it's a branch: the substituent is a -CH2 group where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another H is replaced by OH. So, it's like a geminal diol but with one substituent being cyclohexyl and the other OH. So, the group is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). That makes more sense.

So, the target molecule has two substituents on the cyclohexane: a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. Wait, no, the numbering is 1-, so the substituent is attached to the same carbon as the CHO? Or is the CHO on one carbon and the substituent on another? Let me think again.

The IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The CHO is on carbon 1. Then, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) attached to carbon 1. So, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) with a cyclohexyl and OH groups attached. So, the substituent is a CH2 group with both a cyclohexyl and an OH group. So, the substituent is -CH2-Cyclohexyl and -CH2-O
