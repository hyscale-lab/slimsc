Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that the pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh right, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere but with different curvature properties.

I remember that for a sphere, the metric in 3D is something like dr² + r² dθ², but this seems different. The denominator here is (4 - x² - y²). That makes me think of the metric for a sphere, where the radius squared is 4, so it's a sphere of radius 2 in some way. But wait, pseudosphere—oh, pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, right? So maybe this is a metric for a hyperbolic space?

Wait, no, hyperbolic metrics usually have a form where the denominator is (1 + (x² + y²)/4) or something similar, leading to hyperbolic functions. But this has (4 - x² - y²), which is similar to the metric for a sphere, but perhaps for a different kind of surface.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. So the area should be related to the Gaussian curvature.
