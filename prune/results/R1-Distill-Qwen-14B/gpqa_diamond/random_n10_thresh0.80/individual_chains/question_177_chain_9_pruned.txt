Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength where they peak brightness... Oh, that's probably from the black body radiation curve, right? So, the peak wavelength depends on the temperature of the star.

Oh right, the peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is same, T is same for both stars. So that's a key point.

Then, the radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity probably affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem says that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, which would imply that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the peak wavelength much? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think.

Wait, the observed wavelengths are the same because the stars' own temperatures are the same, but their velocities might cause a shift in the observed wavelengths. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same? That would mean that any Doppler shift is accounted for, but maybe I don't need to worry about that because the question says the peak wavelengths are the same. So I can proceed under the assumption that T is the same for both stars.

Wait, but maybe the Doppler shift is affecting the observed wavelength. So, let's think. The intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_rest) is determined by the star's temperature. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) would be λ_rest multiplied by a Doppler factor depending on the velocity.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift is approximated
