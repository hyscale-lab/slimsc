Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and what happens when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the molecule is made of elements X and Y. The problem gives me their masses: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. Bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the momentum of the photon needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the model mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more like a vibration as well. So the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would correspond to the ground state of both rotation and vibration. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so I guess that's the next higher energy state, but what's the transition?

Wait, but what's the correct approach here. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it can undergo a transition between energy states. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So the photon's energy E_photon should be equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Okay, right, because photon momentum p is related to its energy. The energy E of a photon is E = hν, where ν is the frequency. And since p = E/c, because for photons, E = pc, so p = E/(c) = hν/c. So if I can find the frequency needed for the energy transition, I can find the momentum.

But wait, what's the energy difference between the states? Let me think. The molecule is in the fundamental state. So initial state is the ground state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I guess J=0, but wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational ground state is J=0 in the rigid rotor model, but non-rigid might complicate things a bit. Or maybe we're considering both rotational and vibrational transitions.)

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher state. But what transition is allowed? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). Then the next possible state would be either the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (v=1). But which transition is lower in energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have spacing of h*w, while the rotational energy levels have spacing of something else. Let me think about their energy differences.

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) h w_vib. So the spacing between adjacent levels is h w_vib. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w_vib.

For rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a diatomic molecule, B is given by (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass.

So, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_rot (J=1) - E_rot (J=0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

So the question is, which transition, vibrational or rotational, has a lower energy difference? Because the photon needed would be the one corresponding to the lower energy difference.

Let me compute both energies.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference: ΔE_vib = h w.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s, so ΔE_vib = h * 4e14.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib ≈ 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, compute the rotational energy difference: ΔE_rot = 2B.

B is h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but we need to convert amu to kg because the units for B are in terms of kg and meters.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ about 3.025. So 3.025e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So plugging into B: (h²)/(8 π² μ R²).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Let's compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² μ R².

Compute denominator step by step.
