Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible A and B reagents. The options are combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's the structure of that product? Let me draw it. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on the second carbon, which already has a hydroxyl group and a methyl group. So it would be (CH3)C(OH)CN. Wait, wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons. Let's see: the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. Oh, wait the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 1, I think. Wait, numbering butane as four carbons. So butanenitrile would have the nitrile on carbon 1: CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 1, and the hydroxy and methyl are on carbon 2. So structure would be CN-CH(CH3)(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, with n
