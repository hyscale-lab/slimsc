Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think through this carefully, even if it takes a while.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it uses heavier isotopes of its elements.

Hmm, let's start by identifying the possible compounds involved. I remember that when substances react with metals, especially under certain conditions, they can produce gases and precipitates. For example, metals reacting with acids can produce hydrogen gas and a metal salt precipitate.

Wait, the problem says that gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That's interesting. Let me think: a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Well, hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons, so that's not it. Helium is a noble gas, but its molecule is monoatomic, so each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since helium-4 is the most common). Oh wait, but the molecule's total neutrons and protons would have to be equal. Let me see. So if a molecule is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So two H's have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't work. Helium has two protons and two neutrons. So He has 2 and 2. So the number is equal. So gas W could be helium, but that's a noble gas—it's monoatomic, so each molecule is a single He atom. So for each He molecule, protons = 2, neutrons = 2. So the count is equal. That fits.

But wait, another possibility. What about other molecules? Like, maybe something with more atoms. Let's see, for example, CO2. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (in its most common isotope, C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have (6+8*2) protons and (6 + 8*2) neutrons. 6 +16=22 each. So that would work too, but maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe a molecule like O2 or N2? Let's see: O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That works. Same with N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons, so N2 has 14 each. That works as well. But the question says "each molecule," so any diatomic molecule where the element's protons equal its neutrons would work. But the most common such gases are H2 (but H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons; so H2 would be 2 protons, 0 neutrons—no, that doesn't work), He (He has 2,2), O2 (16,16), N2 (14,14), etc.

Wait, but if the gas is He, that's possible. Alternatively, maybe another monoatomic gas like Ne? Neon has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (in Ne-20). So Ne would have 10 each as well. So the gas could be Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe—any noble gas where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in its most common isotope.

But which one is more likely to form during a reaction? If the reaction is between a metal and an acid, the gas is probably H2. But in that case, H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit the condition. So that can't be it. So then maybe the gas is He? That's less common. Alternatively, perhaps it's O2 or N2. But if the reaction is producing a diatomic gas, which is a product, maybe from the acid.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is between X (a substance) and Y (a liquid). The reaction is violent, which suggests a strong reaction, perhaps an acid-base reaction. If Y is a liquid acid, like H2SO4 or HNO3, but more likely a strong acid like HCl. Wait, more likely, if Y is a liquid, perhaps it's water? But water is a liquid under normal conditions, but maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of an acid. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Well, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above 0°C. What's a substance that melts around there? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). But 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a different substance. Wait, another thought: B could be a metal, perhaps. Or maybe an oxide. Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So heating the precipitate gives B. So perhaps G is a carbonate or a hydroxide that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, if the precipitate is something like calcium carbonate, which upon heating would produce calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CaO, which has a melting point of around 2800°C, not 277 K. Hmm, that's way off. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a sulfide. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this from another angle.

The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Keto acid—like a carboxylic acid?
