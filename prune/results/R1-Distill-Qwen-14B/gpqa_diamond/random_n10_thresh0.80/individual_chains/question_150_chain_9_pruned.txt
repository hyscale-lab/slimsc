Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I should try to figure out the structure based on this.

Starting with the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group here. But wait, a triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but aldehydes usually are deshielded and have a singlet or maybe a doublet if adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe this is a ketone? No, ketones are lower, like around 2 ppm. Oh, wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. So aldehyde proton is around 9-10, and it's a triplet. So maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Because if the aldehyde is at the end, like RCHO, the adjacent would be a CH2 group. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because the CH2 has two protons, each coupling with the aldehyde. So that would make sense.

Next, the aromatic protons. The 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) probably form a para-substituted benzene ring. Because two doublets with similar integrals and coupling would suggest that. The coupling between the two sets of protons would likely be around J=8-9 Hz, typical for para-substituted rings. So each ring has two protons as a doublet. That suggests two phenyl groups attached, perhaps at positions that are para to each other.

Then, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) â€“ broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group nearby. But 2H as a singlet, maybe it's a di-substituted ring with substituents that are adjacent, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substituent that causes the protons to be split in a way that's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group or some conjugated system. Or perhaps it's an aliphatic proton. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom?

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) is a good clue. A d (doublet) with 2H. That often suggests a CH2 group next to another CH2 or something else. The shift at 3.66 is in the range of CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2O. So maybe it's a methylene next to an oxygen atom, like in an ether or ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, two phenyl rings, some oxygen-containing groups, and a CH2OCH2 type structure.

Wait, let me think again. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 (no halogens), N is 1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation:
