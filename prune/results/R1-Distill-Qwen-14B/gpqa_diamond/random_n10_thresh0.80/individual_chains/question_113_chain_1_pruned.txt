Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Hmm, broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because they stretch widely. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are important. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups like in ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or an amide, but I don't think it's an amide because the options don't have nitrogen. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or something else. 

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so maybe there's an alkene group in the compound. So the molecule has a double bond, and maybe an O-H group because of the broad peak.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let me think: the molecular ion peak would be for whatever the molecular formula is. But the fragment at 45â€”what could that be? Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see, possible fragments: CH3CO+ is 43, but 45. Maybe (CH2)2O is 45? Wait, (CH2)2O is C2H4O, molecular weight is 44 (12*2 + 4 + 16*1 = 24+4+16=44). Oh wait, maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 45? No, (CH3)2O is (2*15 + 16) = 2*15 is 30 + 16 is 46. Hmm. Wait, wait, maybe it's a fragment from an ester or something. 

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from an acetylation. Like, if the compound is something like an ester, maybe the loss of a larger group leaves a smaller fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let's think about the options.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. So possible formulas. Let me calculate their molecular weights. 

C6H12O: 6*12=72 + 12*1=12 + 16= 72+12=84+16=100. So molecular weight is 100.

C6H10O: 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=88. Molecular weight 88.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32= 114.

C6H12O2: 72+12+32= 116.

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. So what's 45? Let's think about possible functional groups.

The IR has a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H group. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 are both carbonyl regions. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Like in an ester plus something else or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but looking at the options, which have O and O2.

Option A is C6H12O2: two oxygen atoms. Option C is C6H10O2: same O2 but different H count.

So, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would fit the two IR peaks. So, maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl group, and perhaps another carbonyl. Wait, but esters typically have one carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone and an ester? Or perhaps a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Because in conjugated systems, the carbonyl peak can shift a bit. So, the 1700 might be the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond's C=C. Wait, but why would there be a peak at 1650 in IR? That's more in the range of conjugated carbonyls, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, but no, the options don't have benzene rings, I think, since it's a C6H... Let me think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, in IR, the O-H of a carboxylic acid is usually very broad and around 2500-3300. Also, a strong peak around 1700 for the carboxylic acid carbonyl. But then, why would there be another peak at 1650? Maybe if it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid? But that's a possibility.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, there's a double bond somewhere. So, if the structure includes a vinyl group (like CH2=CH), that would explain the NMR peaks. So maybe the molecule has an ester group and an alkene?

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation? Let me calculate. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond or a carbonyl. Wait, but the compound has a vinyl group (double bond) and maybe a carbonyl, which would add up to two degrees. So if A is 1, that's not enough. So perhaps A is not the correct option.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14-10 + (2*O) ? Wait, wait, the formula is C6H10O2. So the formula is C6H10O2. So degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 + 0)/2 . Wait, O doesn't count here. So 2*6=1
