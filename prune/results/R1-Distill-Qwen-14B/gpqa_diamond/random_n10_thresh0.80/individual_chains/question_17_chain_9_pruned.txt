Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to remember what I know about this.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+ tightly. The problem gives the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex as 5×10^10. And the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form to bind Ca²+ effectively. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects this particular calculation.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA. The problem is asking for the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because EDTA forms a very strong complex with Ca²+, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low, right?

I think the formation constant (K) is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ⇌ CaEDTA²−. The K expression would be K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). Since K is large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, leaving a very small concentration of free Ca²+.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I thought that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find [Ca²+] in solution. Let me set that up.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. The dissociation of the complex would be:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴−

The reverse of the formation reaction, so the K for this would be 1/K. Because K for the formation is 5e10, then the dissociation K is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the K for the dissociation is the inverse of the formation constant. So, if K_form = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) =5e10, then K_dissociate = 1/K_form = 2e-11.

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I can assume that EDTA is in its Y⁴− form. That simplifies things because I don't have to account for the various protonated species. So, in this ideal case, [Y⁴−] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

Let me model the dissociation. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ formed when the complex dissociates. So, [Ca²+] = x, and [Y⁴−] = x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole each of Ca²+ and Y⁴− is produced.

The expression for K_dissociate is:

K_dissociate = [Ca²+][Y⁴−] / [CaY²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02

Since K_dissociate is 2e-11, which is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation becomes x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(
