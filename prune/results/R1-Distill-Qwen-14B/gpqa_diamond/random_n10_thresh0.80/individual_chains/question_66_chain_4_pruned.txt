Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could appear at high energies, but are suppressed by some scale (like the Planck scale or something). The idea is that you can parameterize beyond the Standard Model physics without knowing the exact theory.

Now, the question is about symmetries. Which symmetries do all the operators in SMEFT have to respect. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Lorentz symmetry includes the transformations between different inertial frames, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations plus translations (so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime). So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then they also respect Lorentz, so if an option includes Lorentz but not Poincare, that would be incorrect. But wait, which one is more fundamental here?

I think in effective field theories, you usually require Poincare symmetry. Because the SMEFT is built as a low-energy theory, it should include all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So I would guess that all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So in the options, any choice that includes Lorentz but not Poincare is wrong unless Poincare is included.

Wait, no, the question is which symmetries must be respected. So suppose an operator must respect Poincare, which implies it respects Lorentz. So if I have an option that says 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare), that's redundant because 2 includes 1. But the question is about which symmetries are required. So perhaps the correct answer would include Poincare, but maybe the options don't have that?

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. So if both Lorentz and Poincare are needed, but Poincare implies Lorentz, then perhaps the answer would include Poincare. Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators." So if an operator must respect Poincare, then it's also respecting Lorentz. So if all operators respect Poincare, then they also respect Lorentz, but the question is which of the given symmetries must be respected. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, but I'm not sure if SMEFT requires Poincare. Wait, the Standard Model already has Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT, being an effective theory, must also respect it. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which automatically includes Lorentz. So the correct symmetries would be 2 and possibly others.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C says Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Hmm. So C includes both Lore
