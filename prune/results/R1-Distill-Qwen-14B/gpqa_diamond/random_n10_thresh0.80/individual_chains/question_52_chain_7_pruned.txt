Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and think through the steps.

Alright, the question is about a star with some specific parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Å, and we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) and E is the energy difference. The transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, which is related to the energy difference via E = hc/λ.

Wait, the problem mentions the transition corresponds to 1448 Å. So, that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1. So, the energy difference (E2 - E1) is what we can calculate using this wavelength.

Let me jot down the formula: E = hc / λ. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe we can work in terms of (E2-E1)/(k*T), which will appear in the exponent.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). But in this problem, when the star has spots, some of the surface is cooler, right? But wait, the overall photospheric effective temperature has dropped. So, the effective temperature here is the average over the entire surface, but how does that affect the energy levels?

Wait, in LTE, each region of the photosphere (like the spotted and unspotted areas) is in its own local thermal equilibrium. But the problem states that when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is measured as the blackbody emission across the whole surface, but the actual photospheric temperature in the spots is lower.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature as measured (the overall) is 5500 K. But how does that translate into the actual temperature of the spots and the unspotted regions?

Wait, the effective temperature of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So,
