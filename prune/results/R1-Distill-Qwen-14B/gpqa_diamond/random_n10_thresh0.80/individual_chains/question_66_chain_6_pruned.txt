Okay, I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the choices are combinations of these. Let me remember what each symmetry entails.

First, the options given are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4).

Wait, I think that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are classified by their dimension and the fields they involve. But importantly, any valid operator in the theory must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model.

Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely one because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect this. Without Lorentz symmetry, the theory would be inconsistent, right? So 1 is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So the theory must also respect this. Because the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT operators, which are effective, should also preserve this. So 2 should also be required.

CP symmetry (3) is a bit trickier. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry globally. For example, the CKM matrix in quark mixing leads to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT could potentially violate CP. So not all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. Therefore, 3 isn't a required symmetry for all operators.

CPT symmetry (4), on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SM respects CPT, and I think that any valid operator in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry. Because if a theory doesn't respect CPT, it can lead to issues like acausality or negative probabilities. So 4 is definitely required.

So, looking back at the options:

Which of the four must be respected by all operators?

1 (Lorentz) yes.

2 (Poincare) yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries.

3 (CP) no.

4 (CPT) yes.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. Let's check the options.

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian while preserving the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model and must be preserved by all operators in SMEFT. Without Lorentz symmetry, the theory would be inconsistent.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not globally
