Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from the given choices.

Hmm, okay. So this seems like an electrostatic potential energy problem. I remember that the potential energy between charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law formula. Since all the charges are the same, the potential energy between each pair will be the same, right?

Wait, but wait. The system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But in this case, since the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P, I think I need to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, as well as the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Oh, no, because the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 are arranged in a circle around it, all at a distance of 2 meters. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify they're arranged in a particular way; it just says each is 2 meters away from P. So, I think the 12 charges are each placed at a distance of 2 meters from P, and each is 2 meters apart from each other? Or maybe not. Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, just that each of them is 2 m from P. So perhaps the 12 are all at the same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other might vary, but for the minimum energy, maybe we need them as close as possible?

Wait, wait a minute. Let me clarify. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each is 2 meters from P
