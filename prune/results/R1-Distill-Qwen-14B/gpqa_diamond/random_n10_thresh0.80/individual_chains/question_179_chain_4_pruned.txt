Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is a unitary matrix. Let me think through each option to find the correct statement.

First, looking at the matrices:

W is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is (0,0,1), second (0,1,0), third (1,0,0). So W is a permutation matrix, swapping the first and third basis vectors. I think permutation matrices are orthogonal, which means they're unitary too since all their entries are real. 

X is a 3x3 matrix with entries involving i. Let me check if X is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it has to equal its conjugate transpose. So taking X's conjugate transpose:

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate of X would flip the signs of the imaginary parts:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose (swap rows and columns):

First row becomes: 2i, 0, -i (wait, let me actually calculate it correctly. The conjugate transpose is the transpose of the conjugate matrix.)

Wait, let me compute each element. The (i,j) element of X* is the complex conjugate of X's (j,i) element.

So X's conjugate transpose would be:

First row: [ -i (from X[1,1]), 1 (X[2,1]), 2i (X[3,1]) ]

Second row: [ -1 (X[1,2] is -1, so its conjugate is -1), 0, -1 ]

Third row: [ -2i (X[1,3] is 2i, conjugate is -2i), 1 (X[2,3] is 1), i (X[3,3] is -i, so -i â†’ i) ]

So X* is:

[ [-i, 1, 2i],
  [-1, 0, -1],
  [-2i, 1, i] ]

Comparing to X, which is:

[ [i, -1, 2i],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [2i, -1, -i] ]

They are not equal. For example, the (1,1) element of X is i, but X*'s (1,1) is -i. So X is not Hermitian, so X is not an observable. Hmm, that's useful.

Matrix Y is a 3x3 with real entries. Let me check if it's Hermitian. Since all elements are real, Y is equal to its transpose if Y^T = Y. Let's see Y's transpose:

Y:
Row1:0.5,
