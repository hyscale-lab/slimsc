Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters: RA, DEC, apparent or absolute V magnitude, distance, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)). The task is to determine which stars are observable by both instruments based on their brightness as observed in the V band.

Wait, the problem statement says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star brighter than (apparent V magnitude) 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, the star must be brighter than 16 in V for HIRES. Wait, no: the problem says stars brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, the way it's worded: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, a star that's, say, 16 mag apparent would be observable by HIRES but not by ESPRESSO. But wait, I'm getting confused. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's V mag is less than 17 (brighter than 17), it's visible with ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's V mag less than 16.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The V magnitude scale goes from brighter to fainter. So, a star that is magnitude 5 is brighter than one at magnitude 10. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (so, apparent V magnitude <17), then stars with V mag <17 are observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag <16.

So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than both 17 and 16, which would require it to be brighter than 16 (since 1
