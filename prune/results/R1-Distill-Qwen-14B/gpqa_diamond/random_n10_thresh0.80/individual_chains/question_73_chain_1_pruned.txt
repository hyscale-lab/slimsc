Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities directly because of the famous "relativity of velocity." Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is different. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but actually, if both are moving in the same direction, we're looking at the velocity of one as seen from the other. So I think that's the right approach.

Wait, let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no. The question is about their relative speed, so it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So I should compute the relative speed using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no—wait, the formula for relative velocity when they're moving in the same direction. So, the frame where astronaut A is at rest, what's the velocity of astronaut B?

Wait, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of B in the original frame, and v is the velocity of A in the original frame. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think I might get confused here. Let me think again.

Let me restate the problem. In the lab frame, astronaut 2m is moving at 0.6c, and 3m is moving at 0.5c. Both in the same direction. So I need to find the relative speed of astronaut B (0.5c) as seen from astronaut A (0.6c). So the relative velocity u' would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) ), where u is
