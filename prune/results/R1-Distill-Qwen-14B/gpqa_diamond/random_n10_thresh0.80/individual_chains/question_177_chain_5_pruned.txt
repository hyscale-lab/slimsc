Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I remember that luminosity relates to a star's radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio, but wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity unless it's about something like the star's stage in its life cycle. But the question tells us to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here except perhaps for determining other factors like temperature.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is same, then T is same since λ and T are inversely proportional. So T1 = T2.

Wait, that's a key point. So both stars have the same temperature. Oh, but I should double-check that. Since the peak wavelength is the same, that implies same temperature.

So now, using the luminosity formula L = 4πσR²T⁴, since T is the same, the luminosity depends on R². So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make L1 2.25 times L2. So the answer would be option A. But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So why is there an option B which is around 2.32? Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, the radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving
