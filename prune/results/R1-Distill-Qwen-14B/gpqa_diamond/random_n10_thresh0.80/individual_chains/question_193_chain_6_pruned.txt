Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that's an unusual power. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance (d), so plx = 1/d. So distance is 1/plx.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars (let's call it N) varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ‚àù (1/plx)^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait no, wait. The question states that N varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Because 1/plx is d, N is proportional to d^5. So N goes up with distance to the fifth power. But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe we're being asked about the differential change, like the number of stars added per additional distance.

Alternatively, maybe we're considering how the number of stars increases as you go to larger distances, so the rate of increase would depend on how N changes with r. Let's think about it in terms of differentials. If N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with respect to r, dN/dr, would be something like 5r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but wait the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Oh, wait, maybe the question is about the number density. The number of stars per unit volume. Or perhaps it's about how many stars you'd count in a
