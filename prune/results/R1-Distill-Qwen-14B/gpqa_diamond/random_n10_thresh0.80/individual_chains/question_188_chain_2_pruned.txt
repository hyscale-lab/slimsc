Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the structure is defined by the arrangement of atoms in space, and each crystal type has specific properties. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal is one where all the lattice vectors are of equal length but the angles between them are the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, right? I think the formula for that uses the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh yeah, the formula I remember is something like d = (1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) )) multiplied by some factor involving the lattice constants and the cosines of the angles. Wait, I think it's d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ). Or wait, maybe the denominator is more of a combination. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ). But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here.

So first, let's note down the given values. The interatomic distance a is 10 Å. The Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula for d:

d = a / [ sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2(1*1 * cos 30°) ) ]

Let me compute the denominator step by step. The terms:

First term: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Second term: 2*(1*1)*cos30 = 2*1* (√3/2) = √3 ≈1.732.

Since all three angles are 30 degrees, each of the three cross terms contributes √3. So the second, third, and fourth terms each contribute √3. So adding them up: 3 terms of √3 each, so 3√3 ≈5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Then sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196). Let me compute that. Since 2.86^2 is 8.1796 (because 2.86 * 2.86: 2*2=4, 2*.86=1.72, .86*2=1.72, .86*.86≈0.74. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to just calculate it. Let me think: 2.85^2 is 8.1225, 2.86^2 is 8.1796, 2.87^2 is 8.2369. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.864.

So denominator is approx 2.864.

Therefore, d = 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.494 (because 2.864 * 3.494 ≈ 10). Wait, wait no, let me compute 10 divided by 2.864.

Let me calculate 10 / 2.864. Hmm. 2.864 * 3 = 8.592. 2.864 * 3.5 = 10.024. Oh wait, because 2.864 * 3.5 is (2.864 *3) + (2.864 * 0.5) = 8.592 + 1.432 = 10.024. So 10 / 2.864 = approx 3.494.

Wait, that's about 3.494 Angstroms. But looking at the options, they're all around 9 or 10. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait wait. Oh wait! The formula might have been wrong. Maybe I inverted something. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance.

Oh right, the correct formula for d in a crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha)}}}

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So in this case, the formula simplifies a bit. So substituting:

d = a / sqrt( (1 +1 +1) + 2*(1*1 * cos30) *3 )

Wait, because for each pair hk, hl, kl, we have 2hk cosθ. So for (111), each of the three cross terms is 2*(1*1)*cos30. So each term is 2*1*1*(√3/2) = √3. So three terms, each √3, so 3√3.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3√3).

Wait, 3 + 3√3 is approximately 3 + 5.196 = 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.864. So d is 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.494 Å. But the options are all in the 9s and 10s. So I must have messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another possibility is that the formula uses the reciprocal of a, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is reciprocal of sqrt of the sum. Wait, no, the formula I used is correct.

Wait, wait, maybe I confused the formula for interplanar distance. Another approach: In a cubic system, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l²)). But here for rhombohedral, which is a special case where a = b = c, but angles are not 90 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosγ) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosα) ) ) * (1/a)

Wait, no, a is in the numerator. So I think the formula is correct as I wrote earlier.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the same as a, but in a rhombohedral structure, the relationship is more complex. Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is
