Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually have to satisfy certain conditions, right? Oh right, they must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the absolute square must be finite. But wait, the question says when measuring positions, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside of that region? Or is the given wave function only valid between x=1 and x=3?

Hmm, the problem states that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for each particle in a part of space where it can exist. So that part of space is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this interval. But wait, the wave function is given in the region x=1 to x=3 as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but for a valid wave function, it must be continuous, but here it's given as a piecewise function—zero outside, and this expression inside. But wait, another thing: the wave function must have an integral of the square of its absolute value equal to 1 (normalization). So I think I need to calculate the normalization constant 'a' so that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function. Let me write that as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B(x) = -0.5.

So the absolute square is |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2, because for a complex number a + bi, the magnitude squared is a² + b². Wait, no, wait. Actually, it's (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b². So yes, the absolute square is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. So the integral becomes the sum of two integrals:

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) ) dx ] from 1 to 3 + Integral [ 0.25 dx ] from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So:

a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding the two parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Take the square root: a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let me compute this numerically.

First, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this region equals 1.

The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:  
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   This is straightforward:  
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):  
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213, \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option B.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i.

Or is the given wave function only valid between x=1 and x=3?

Hmm, the problem states that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for each particle in a part of space where it can exist. So that part of space is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this interval. But wait, the wave function is given in the region x=1 to x=3 as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but for a valid wave function, it must be continuous, but here it's given as a piecewise function—zero outside, and this expression inside. But wait, another thing: the wave function must have an integral of the square of its absolute value equal to 1 (normalization). So I think I need to calculate the normalization constant 'a' so that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function. Let me write that as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B(x) = -0.5.

So the absolute square is |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2, because for a complex number a + bi, the magnitude squared is a² + b². Wait, no, wait. Actually, it's (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b². So yes, the absolute square is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. So the integral becomes the sum of two integrals:

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) ) dx ] from 1 to 3 + Integral [ 0.25 dx ] from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So:

a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding the two parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Take the square root: a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let me compute this numerically.

First, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this region equals 1.

The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:  
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   This is straightforward:  
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):  
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213, \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option B.
