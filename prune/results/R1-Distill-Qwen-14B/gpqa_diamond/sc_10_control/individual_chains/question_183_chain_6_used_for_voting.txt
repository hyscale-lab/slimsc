Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction.

Okay, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering probably goes from 1 to 6 in a circle. So, position 3 has an ene, meaning a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is like a CHO, so that's attached to carbon 2. At position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is like CH2=CH-, so that's attached to carbon 5. And then, on the same carbon (I think), there's a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position... wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid would be at a position. Let me think: the numbering would have the cyclohexene as the base. So, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 5, and the acid is probably at position 1? Because when you have a substituent like carboxylic acid, the numbering starts from the closest substituent.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and there's a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, perhaps? Because the suffix -carboxylic acid indicates that the carboxylic group is attached to the ring. So the numbering starts such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the double bond is between 3 and 4 (cyclohex-3-ene). So position 2 has a formyl, and position 5 has a vinyl group.

So the structure would be cyclohexane ring, with double bonds at 3-4, a formyl (CHO) at 2, a vinyl (CH2-CH2 with a double bond) at 5, and a COOH at 1.

Wait, no, the vinyl is CH2=CH–, attached to the ring. So the ring has four substituents: COOH at 1, CHO at 2, vinyl group at 5, and the double bond between 3 and 4.

So, the molecule is cyclohexane with substituents. Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in reactions where they perform a deoxygenative decarboxylation. Alternatively, I remember that when carboxylic acids react with P and HI, they undergo a reaction where the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. Or, more accurately, the carboxylic acid group is replaced with a methyl or similar group. Wait, but the exact process might depend on conditions.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can also lead to the formation of a Wittig reaction if there's a carbonyl group present. Because the Wittig reagent is typically made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). The formyl is a carbonyl, so maybe it can form a ylide with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, no. Let me think about what red phosphorus and HI do. I remember that red phosphorus in HI is a reagent that can abstract an oxygen. Maybe it's used to convert carbonyl groups into methylene groups. Wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, right? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, reducing ketones to alkanes. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in another type of reduction. Oh, right! The Heyns reduction perhaps? Or another method, maybe the hydroxymethylation?

Wait, perhaps another angle: the reaction could be a ring-opening or addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall reaction. The starting molecule has a COOH group, a CHO, a double bond (from cyclohexene), and a vinyl group.

When reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI, I think that the COOH group (carboxylic acid) would react. Because I remember that HI can protonate the carboxylic acid, making it a better leaving group. Red phosphorus could help in eliminating the oxygen, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: Carboxylic acids can react with P and HI to form alkanes. For example, the reaction might replace the COOH group with CH3. Let me think. If COOH is converted to CH3, then the ring would have a methyl group at position 1. So, the product would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene with a methyl group where the COOH was.

But wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the product after reaction would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene with the COOH group replaced by CH2-... Wait, wait, maybe the reaction removes the carboxylic acid and adds something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Decarboxylation typically involves removing CO2, but under certain conditions, like with heat or specific reagents, carboxylic acids lose CO2.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a CH2 group. So, COOH becomes CH2PH(O)(O) something, but then after the reaction, the oxygen is replaced.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: The reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted to CH2I. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the -COOH becomes -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, but that's probably beyond what I need for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is converted into a methyl group. So, COOH becomes CH3.

Wait, let's think about the structure after the reaction. The starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring. So, the product would have the same cyclohexene ring but with the COOH group replaced.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact transformation. Maybe I should look at the possible products and then calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, I need to count the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

But to find the product, I need to figure out what the molecule looks like after the reaction.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me think about its structure.

Cyclohexene ring: positions 3 and 4 have a double bond. Position 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl (CH2=CH–), and position 1 has a COOH group.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Also, red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent.

Wait, another approach: HI is a source of H+ and I- ions. Red phosphorus in HI can form a phosphorus ylide, which can then react with carbonyl groups.

Wait, so the formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl. If there's a ylide, perhaps it would react with the formyl group in a Wittig-like reaction. But wait, the Wittig reaction typically requires a phosphorus ylide, which is generated from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. But in this case, red phosphorus and HI might form something similar. So, maybe the formyl group would undergo a Wittig reaction, converting it into a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the formyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, converting the COOH group into a CH2 group. So, the COOH would leave as CO2, and the ring would have a CH2 group where the COOH was.

Wait, but the reagent is red phosphorus and HI, which I think is more about substituting the acid. For example, when a carboxylic acid reacts with H2SO4 and H2O, it's just the acid itself. But with HI and red phosphorus, it's a substitution.

Another thought: The reaction could be the formation of an alkane from the carboxylic acid. So, the COOH becomes CH3. So, the product would have a CH3 group at position 1, the formyl (CHO) at position 2, the vinyl (CH2=CH–) at position 5, and the cyclohexene ring still has the double bond between 3 and 4.

Wait, but then what about the other groups? The formyl group is CHO, will that react as well?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to think about each substituent and how they might react.

The structure has:

- A cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring).

- A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5. That's another double bond.

- A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, which is a carbonyl group (another double bond).

- A carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1.

So, the starting material has three double bonds: the cyclohexene (1), the vinyl (2), and the formyl (3). So, the degree of unsaturation is 3 from the rings and double bonds. Wait, but wait, cyclohexene is a ring plus a double bond. So the ring counts as one degree, the double bond as another. So the cyclohexene has two degrees.

Wait, let me calculate the DoU for the starting material. DoU is the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc. So, for the starting molecule:

The cyclohexene ring: that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the ring contributes one DoU (from the ring itself), and the double bond adds another DoU. So, two DoU from the ring.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) adds another DoU. The formyl group (CHO) adds another DoU because it's a carbonyl.

The carboxylic acid (COOH) doesn't add any DoU because it's a single bond. So, the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene: 2 DoU (ring and double bond)
- Vinyl group: 1 DoU
- Formyl group: 1 DoU
Total: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 DoU.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene), which is a ring plus a double bond (so 2 DoU for that part).

The vinyl group is a substituent with its own double bond (another DoU).

The formyl group is a substituent with a carbonyl (another DoU).

COOH is a functional group without a double bond, so no additional DoU.

So the total starting DoU is 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) = 4 DoU.

Now, upon reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

The reaction likely affects the COOH group and possibly the formyl group.

Wait, I think that when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it is converted into an alkane. So, the COOH group (-COOH) becomes a CH3 group. So, that's a substitution where the COOH is replaced by CH3.

Additionally, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo a reduction. Because when a carbonyl is treated with a reducing agent like H2/Pd or another reducing agent, it becomes a CH2 group. But in this case, the reagents might cause a similar effect. Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus and HI can reduce the formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group remains unchanged. Let me think.

But the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI, which is a strong acid. Another possibility is that the formyl group undergoes a Wittig reaction. Since red phosphorus is present, perhaps it forms a ylide with HI, which then reacts with the formyl group.

Wait, the Wittig reaction typically uses a ylide to attack a carbonyl group, converting it into an alkene. So, if the formyl (CHO) is attacked by the ylide, it would form an alkene.

But wait, the starting structure already has a cyclohexene and a vinyl group. So, if another double bond is formed from the formyl group, that would change the DoU.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is reduced to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into a methyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH becomes CH2I, but that might not be relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Decarboxylation typically involves the loss of CO2, but under certain conditions, maybe something else happens.

Let me try to outline the possible reactions:

1. The COOH group is converted to a CH3 group. So, the COOH (which is at position 1) becomes CH3.

2. The formyl group (CHO) is either reduced to CH2OH, or perhaps undergoes a Wittig reaction to form a new double bond.

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) might undergo some reaction as well, but perhaps it's more likely that the reaction conditions would protonate it or something else.

But wait, the problem states that red phosphorus and HI are used. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of carbonyl groups.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for similar reactions. I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes substitution to form an alkane. So, the -COOH becomes -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, but upon workup, it becomes -CH3. So, the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group.

If that's the case, then the product would have a methyl group at position 1, the formyl group at position 2, the vinyl group at position 5, and the cyclohexene ring with the double bond at 3.

Now, the formyl group is CHO. Will that react under these conditions? Well, HI is a strong acid and can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the alpha carbon more electrophilic. Red phosphorus can then facilitate a substitution or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group will be reduced to a CH2 group. Because red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to reduce carbonyl groups.

So, if both the COOH and the CHO groups are converted, then:

- COOH → CH3
- CHO → CH2OH? Or maybe → CH2 group.

Wait, but with red phosphorus and HI, I think the situation is more about substitution. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the product.

If the COOH is converted to CH3, and the formyl (CHO) is converted to CH2 (i.e., reduced), then the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (still with double bond at 3)
- CH3 at position 1
- CH2 at position 2
- vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position5.

Wait, but the vinyl group is CH2=CH–. Would that react? With red phosphorus and HI, could the vinyl group undergo any change?

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group remains as is because it's a substituent.

Wait, but the starting material already has a double bond in the ring (cyclohexene), a double bond in the vinyl group, and a carbonyl in the formyl group. If the COOH becomes CH3 and the formyl becomes CH2, then we'd lose the carbonyl and the vinyl double bond. Hmm, no, because the vinyl group's double bond would still be present.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the DoU of the product.

Let me think about the product's structure. If the starting material had 4 DoU and, after the reaction, the COOH is replaced by CH3, and the formyl is replaced by CH2, then what changes?

Wait, let me structure this.

Original molecule:

- Cyclohexene (ring, 1 DoU; double bond, 1 DoU)
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH–, 1 DoU)
- Formyl group (CHO, 1 DoU)
Total DoU = 4.

After reaction:

- Cyclohexene ring remains (DoU 2)
- Vinyl group remains (DoU 1)
- Formyl group is converted to CH2 (no DoU)
- COOH converted to CH3 (no DoU; it's a single bond)

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: DoU 2
- Vinyl: DoU 1
Total DoU: 3.

But wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so that's a double bond, contributing 1 DoU. The cyclohexene contributes 2 (ring and double bond). The formyl group is gone, replaced by CH2, so no DoU. The COOH is gone, replaced by CH3, so no DoU.

So, product DoU is 3.

But wait, let me think again. What if the formyl group is not converted but another reaction happens.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: 2 DoU
- Vinyl: 1 DoU
- CH2 at position 2: no DoU
Total: 3 DoU.

Alternatively, what if the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group remains?

Then, the product would have 3 DoU.

But looking at the options, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So B is 3. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to more changes.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group also reacts. For example, if the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is protonated and then undergoes some addition.

But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe the vinyl group undergoes a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the COOH group, and the formyl group remains.

Another possibility: The reaction conditions could lead to the opening of the cyclohexene ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and formyl group react to form new bonds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the reagents again: red phosphorus and excess HI. This is a classic condition for the elimination of the carboxylic acid group. So, the reaction replaces -COOH with -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, which upon hydrolysis would give -CH2-OH. But wait, no, because the reaction is done with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a substitution to -CH3.

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (DoU 2)
- vinyl group (DoU 1)
- formyl group (DoU 1)
Wait, no, because if the formyl is converted to CH2, then it's just a single bond, so no DoU.

Wait, I think my confusion is whether the formyl group reacts. So, if only the COOH group is converted, the formyl remains, leading to:

DoU: 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) =4. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Alternatively, perhaps both the COOH and the formyl are converted. The COOH becomes CH3 (no DoU), and the formyl becomes CH2 (no DoU). So, the product would have DoU from the cyclohexene (2) and the vinyl (1), totaling 3. So, the product would have a DoU of 3, which is option B.

But wait, let me think again. If the formyl group is reduced, then that would remove one DoU. So, starting with 4 DoU, and losing the formyl's DoU, we get 3. So, option B.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the opening of the cyclohexene ring, but I don't think so because that would require more drastic conditions.

So, putting it all together, the product has three DoU, so the answer is option B)3.

The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation, DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with:
     - A double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (cyclohexene contributes 2 DoU: 1 from the ring and 1 from the double bond).
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2 (contributes 1 DoU from the carbonyl group).
     - A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5 (contributes 1 DoU from the double bond).
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 (does not contribute to DoU).

   Total DoU of the starting material = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) = **4**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI typically replace the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) with a methyl group (-CH3).
   - The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-), eliminating its DoU.
   - The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) and the cyclohexene double bond remain unchanged.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The product retains:
     - The cyclohexene ring (2 DoU: 1 from the ring and 1 from the double bond).
     - The vinyl group (1 DoU from the double bond).
   - The formyl group is reduced to -CH2-, and the carboxylic acid group is replaced by -CH3, both of which do not contribute to DoU.

   Total DoU of the product = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) = **3**.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 1**: Incorrect, as the product retains the cyclohexene and vinyl double bonds, contributing to a higher DoU.
   - **B) 3**: Correct, as explained above.
   - **C) 5**: Incorrect, as the reaction reduces the number of double bonds and functional groups.
   - **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the product still contains unsaturated bonds.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.

Answer: B

Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction.

Okay, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering probably goes from 1 to 6 in a circle. So, position 3 has an ene, meaning a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is like a CHO, so that's attached to carbon 2. At position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is like CH2=CH-, so that's attached to carbon 5. And then, on the same carbon (I think), there's a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position... wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid would be at a position. Let me think: the numbering would have the cyclohexene as the base. So, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 5, and the acid is probably at position 1? Because when you have a substituent like carboxylic acid, the numbering starts from the closest substituent.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and there's a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, perhaps? Because the suffix -carboxylic acid indicates that the carboxylic group is attached to the ring. So the numbering starts such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the double bond is between 3 and 4 (cyclohex-3-ene). So position 2 has a formyl, and position 5 has a vinyl group.

So the structure would be cyclohexane ring, with double bonds at 3-4, a formyl (CHO) at 2, a vinyl (CH2-CH2 with a double bond) at 5, and a COOH at 1.

Wait, no, the vinyl is CH2=CH–, attached to the ring. So the ring has four substituents: COOH at 1, CHO at 2, vinyl group at 5, and the double bond between 3 and 4.

So, the molecule is cyclohexane with substituents. Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in reactions where they perform a deoxygenative decarboxylation. Alternatively, I remember that when carboxylic acids react with P and HI, they undergo a reaction where the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. Or, more accurately, the carboxylic acid group is replaced with a methyl or similar group. Wait, but the exact process might depend on conditions.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can also lead to the formation of a Wittig reaction if there's a carbonyl group present. Because the Wittig reagent is typically made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). The formyl is a carbonyl, so maybe it can form a ylide with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, no. Let me think about what red phosphorus and HI do. I remember that red phosphorus in HI is a reagent that can abstract an oxygen. Maybe it's used to convert carbonyl groups into methylene groups. Wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, right? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, reducing ketones to alkanes. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in another type of reduction. Oh, right! The Heyns reduction perhaps? Or another method, maybe the hydroxymethylation?

Wait, perhaps another angle: the reaction could be a ring-opening or addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall reaction. The starting molecule has a COOH group, a CHO, a double bond (from cyclohexene), and a vinyl group.

When reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI, I think that the COOH group (carboxylic acid) would react. Because I remember that HI can protonate the carboxylic acid, making it a better leaving group. Red phosphorus could help in eliminating the oxygen, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: Carboxylic acids can react with P and HI to form alkanes. For example, the reaction might replace the COOH group with CH3. Let me think. If COOH is converted to CH3, then the ring would have a methyl group at position 1. So, the product would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene with a methyl group where the COOH was.

But wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the product after reaction would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene with the COOH group replaced by CH2-... Wait, wait, maybe the reaction removes the carboxylic acid and adds something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Decarboxylation typically involves removing CO2, but under certain conditions, like with heat or specific reagents, carboxylic acids lose CO2.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a CH2 group. So, COOH becomes CH2PH(O)(O) something, but then after the reaction, the oxygen is replaced.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: The reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted to CH2I. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the -COOH becomes -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, but that's probably beyond what I need for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is converted into a methyl group. So, COOH becomes CH3.

Wait, let's think about the structure after the reaction. The starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring. So, the product would have the same cyclohexene ring but with the COOH group replaced.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact transformation. Maybe I should look at the possible products and then calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, I need to count the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

But to find the product, I need to figure out what the molecule looks like after the reaction.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me think about its structure.

Cyclohexene ring: positions 3 and 4 have a double bond. Position 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl (CH2=CH–), and position 1 has a COOH group.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Also, red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent.

Wait, another approach: HI is a source of H+ and I- ions. Red phosphorus in HI can form a phosphorus ylide, which can then react with carbonyl groups.

Wait, so the formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl. If there's a ylide, perhaps it would react with the formyl group in a Wittig-like reaction. But wait, the Wittig reaction typically requires a phosphorus ylide, which is generated from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. But in this case, red phosphorus and HI might form something similar. So, maybe the formyl group would undergo a Wittig reaction, converting it into a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the formyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, converting the COOH group into a CH2 group. So, the COOH would leave as CO2, and the ring would have a CH2 group where the COOH was.

Wait, but the reagent is red phosphorus and HI, which I think is more about substituting the acid. For example, when a carboxylic acid reacts with H2SO4 and H2O, it's just the acid itself. But with HI and red phosphorus, it's a substitution.

Another thought: The reaction could be the formation of an alkane from the carboxylic acid. So, the COOH becomes CH3. So, the product would have a CH3 group at position 1, the formyl (CHO) at position 2, the vinyl (CH2=CH–) at position 5, and the cyclohexene ring still has the double bond between 3 and 4.

Wait, but then what about the other groups? The formyl group is CHO, will that react as well?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to think about each substituent and how they might react.

The structure has:

- A cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring).

- A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5. That's another double bond.

- A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, which is a carbonyl group (another double bond).

- A carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1.

So, the starting material has three double bonds: the cyclohexene (1), the vinyl (2), and the formyl (3). So, the degree of unsaturation is 3 from the rings and double bonds. Wait, but wait, cyclohexene is a ring plus a double bond. So the ring counts as one degree, the double bond as another. So the cyclohexene has two degrees.

Wait, let me calculate the DoU for the starting material. DoU is the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc. So, for the starting molecule:

The cyclohexene ring: that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the ring contributes one DoU (from the ring itself), and the double bond adds another DoU. So, two DoU from the ring.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) adds another DoU. The formyl group (CHO) adds another DoU because it's a carbonyl.

The carboxylic acid (COOH) doesn't add any DoU because it's a single bond. So, the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene: 2 DoU (ring and double bond)
- Vinyl group: 1 DoU
- Formyl group: 1 DoU
Total: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 DoU.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene), which is a ring plus a double bond (so 2 DoU for that part).

The vinyl group is a substituent with its own double bond (another DoU).

The formyl group is a substituent with a carbonyl (another DoU).

COOH is a functional group without a double bond, so no additional DoU.

So the total starting DoU is 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) = 4 DoU.

Now, upon reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

The reaction likely affects the COOH group and possibly the formyl group.

Wait, I think that when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it is converted into an alkane. So, the COOH group (-COOH) becomes a CH3 group. So, that's a substitution where the COOH is replaced by CH3.

Additionally, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo a reduction. Because when a carbonyl is treated with a reducing agent like H2/Pd or another reducing agent, it becomes a CH2 group. But in this case, the reagents might cause a similar effect. Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus and HI can reduce the formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group remains unchanged. Let me think.

But the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI, which is a strong acid. Another possibility is that the formyl group undergoes a Wittig reaction. Since red phosphorus is present, perhaps it forms a ylide with HI, which then reacts with the formyl group.

Wait, the Wittig reaction typically uses a ylide to attack a carbonyl group, converting it into an alkene. So, if the formyl (CHO) is attacked by the ylide, it would form an alkene.

But wait, the starting structure already has a cyclohexene and a vinyl group. So, if another double bond is formed from the formyl group, that would change the DoU.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is reduced to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into a methyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH becomes CH2I, but that might not be relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Decarboxylation typically involves the loss of CO2, but under certain conditions, maybe something else happens.

Let me try to outline the possible reactions:

1. The COOH group is converted to a CH3 group. So, the COOH (which is at position 1) becomes CH3.

2. The formyl group (CHO) is either reduced to CH2OH, or perhaps undergoes a Wittig reaction to form a new double bond.

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) might undergo some reaction as well, but perhaps it's more likely that the reaction conditions would protonate it or something else.

But wait, the problem states that red phosphorus and HI are used. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of carbonyl groups.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for similar reactions. I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes substitution to form an alkane. So, the -COOH becomes -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, but upon workup, it becomes -CH3. So, the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group.

If that's the case, then the product would have a methyl group at position 1, the formyl group at position 2, the vinyl group at position 5, and the cyclohexene ring with the double bond at 3.

Now, the formyl group is CHO. Will that react under these conditions? Well, HI is a strong acid and can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the alpha carbon more electrophilic. Red phosphorus can then facilitate a substitution or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group will be reduced to a CH2 group. Because red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to reduce carbonyl groups.

So, if both the COOH and the CHO groups are converted, then:

- COOH → CH3
- CHO → CH2OH? Or maybe → CH2 group.

Wait, but with red phosphorus and HI, I think the situation is more about substitution. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the product.

If the COOH is converted to CH3, and the formyl (CHO) is converted to CH2 (i.e., reduced), then the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (still with double bond at 3)
- CH3 at position 1
- CH2 at position 2
- vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position5.

Wait, but the vinyl group is CH2=CH–. Would that react? With red phosphorus and HI, could the vinyl group undergo any change?

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group remains as is because it's a substituent.

Wait, but the starting material already has a double bond in the ring (cyclohexene), a double bond in the vinyl group, and a carbonyl in the formyl group. If the COOH becomes CH3 and the formyl becomes CH2, then we'd lose the carbonyl and the vinyl double bond. Hmm, no, because the vinyl group's double bond would still be present.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the DoU of the product.

Let me think about the product's structure. If the starting material had 4 DoU and, after the reaction, the COOH is replaced by CH3, and the formyl is replaced by CH2, then what changes?

Wait, let me structure this.

Original molecule:

- Cyclohexene (ring, 1 DoU; double bond, 1 DoU)
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH–, 1 DoU)
- Formyl group (CHO, 1 DoU)
Total DoU = 4.

After reaction:

- Cyclohexene ring remains (DoU 2)
- Vinyl group remains (DoU 1)
- Formyl group is converted to CH2 (no DoU)
- COOH converted to CH3 (no DoU; it's a single bond)

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: DoU 2
- Vinyl: DoU 1
Total DoU: 3.

But wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so that's a double bond, contributing 1 DoU. The cyclohexene contributes 2 (ring and double bond). The formyl group is gone, replaced by CH2, so no DoU. The COOH is gone, replaced by CH3, so no DoU.

So, product DoU is 3.

But wait, let me think again. What if the formyl group is not converted but another reaction happens.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: 2 DoU
- Vinyl: 1 DoU
- CH2 at position 2: no DoU
Total: 3 DoU.

Alternatively, what if the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group remains?

Then, the product would have 3 DoU.

But looking at the options, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So B is 3. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to more changes.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group also reacts. For example, if the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is protonated and then undergoes some addition.

But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe the vinyl group undergoes a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the COOH group, and the formyl group remains.

Another possibility: The reaction conditions could lead to the opening of the cyclohexene ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and formyl group react to form new bonds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the reagents again: red phosphorus and excess HI. This is a classic condition for the elimination of the carboxylic acid group. So, the reaction replaces -COOH with -CH2-PH(O)(O)I, which upon hydrolysis would give -CH2-OH. But wait, no, because the reaction is done with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a substitution to -CH3.

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (DoU 2)
- vinyl group (DoU 1)
- formyl group (DoU 1)
Wait, no, because if the formyl is converted to CH2, then it's just a single bond, so no DoU.

Wait, I think my confusion is whether the formyl group reacts. So, if only the COOH group is converted, the formyl remains, leading to:

DoU: 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) =4. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Alternatively, perhaps both the COOH and the formyl are converted. The COOH becomes CH3 (no DoU), and the formyl becomes CH2 (no DoU). So, the product would have DoU from the cyclohexene (2) and the vinyl (1), totaling 3. So, the product would have a DoU of 3, which is option B.

But wait, let me think again. If the formyl group is reduced, then that would remove one DoU. So, starting with 4 DoU, and losing the formyl's DoU, we get 3. So, option B.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the opening of the cyclohexene ring, but I don't think so because that would require more drastic conditions.

So, putting it all together, the product has three DoU, so the answer is option B)3.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation, DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with:
     - A double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (cyclohexene contributes 2 DoU: 1 from the ring and 1 from the double bond).
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2 (contributes 1 DoU from the carbonyl group).
     - A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5 (contributes 1 DoU from the double bond).
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 (does not contribute to DoU).

   Total DoU of the starting material = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) = **4**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI typically replace the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) with a methyl group (-CH3).
   - The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-), eliminating its DoU.
   - The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) and the cyclohexene double bond remain unchanged.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The product retains:
     - The cyclohexene ring (2 DoU: 1 from the ring and 1 from the double bond).
     - The vinyl group (1 DoU from the double bond).
   - The formyl group is reduced to -CH2-, and the carboxylic acid group is replaced by -CH3, both of which do not contribute to DoU.

   Total DoU of the product = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) = **3**.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 1**: Incorrect, as the product retains the cyclohexene and vinyl double bonds, contributing to a higher DoU.
   - **B) 3**: Correct, as explained above.
   - **C) 5**: Incorrect, as the reaction reduces the number of double bonds and functional groups.
   - **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the product still contains unsaturated bonds.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.

Answer: B
