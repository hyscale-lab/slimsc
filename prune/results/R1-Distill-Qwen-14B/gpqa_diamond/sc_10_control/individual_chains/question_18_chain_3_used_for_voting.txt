Alright, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, okay, let me break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the mass might not matter directly for the abundance calculations, unless it's about their lifetimes or something else, but the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe mass isn't a factor here. I'll focus on the abundance data.

The given abundances are using the EW (equivalent width) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). Let's list out what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no, I think it's [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log(nX/nY / (nX/nY)_sun) → which is log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) → which is log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → so their Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, Fe abundance is solar. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so [Fe/H]_1 = 0 →  log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0 → so log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So let me write down the solar values:

nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → approximately 3.16e-5.

nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-5) → 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, wait no. [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

But in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) → wait, no, wait. Let me think about it.

Wait, nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But nH is the hydrogen number density. So perhaps the hydrogen densities of the stars are different from the Sun's? But maybe we can ignore that because we're looking for the ratio of silicon in the two stars.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi1) / (nSi2) ?

Wait, but the question says 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.' So I think that's nSi1 / nSi2.

So I need to find nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of the solar values and the given [X/Y] values.

Let me approach each star step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) is log( (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) ) → log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = log( (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) ) → which is log( (nSi/nFe)_sun ) → which is log( (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) → since nH_sun cancels out.

Given that nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, and nMg_sun/nH_sun is 1e-5.

Wait, but what's nSi_sun/nH_sun? Hmm, from the Sun's composition, we know nFe/nH is given as (12 + log10(nFe/nH)) =7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about Si? Since the question doesn't provide [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps I can compute nSi_sun/nFe_sun.

Because [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)_sun. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The [X/Y] for the Sun would be zero because it's the reference.

Wait, no, the [X/Y] scale is relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_sun = 0. So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)_sun = 0. Wait, that's trivial.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's compute nSi1 and nSi2.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun) → because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But wait, nSi_sun/nFe_sun is the solar ratio. Let me compute that.

nSi_sun = ?

Wait, wait, from the Sun's data, I can only directly compute nFe and nMg. Maybe I can find nSi_sun from another ratio. Because the question gives [Mg/Si]_2 for Star 2, but not for Star 1.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is needed. Let's see. The Sun's [Mg/H] is 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Do I have the data? The question only gives for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, which gives nFe/nH = 3.16e-5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But no data on Si. Hmm, maybe I can assume that the Sun has a certain [Mg/Si], but I don't have that. Unless I'm supposed to compute it from the given data.

Wait, perhaps the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star 2 is given. But for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3. But Star_2's [Mg/H] is zero.

Wait, maybe I should compute nMg2 and then find nSi2 from [Mg/Si] = 0.3.

Hmm, perhaps I should find nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of their respective nH, using the given data.

Let me proceed step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Which rearranges to:

nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

So substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 ] * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

The nFe_sun cancels:

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

So nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

But I don't know nH1 or nH_sun. Wait, but maybe nH is proportional to the star's surface gravity and temperature, but perhaps we can treat the ratio nSi1/nSi2 by eliminating nH.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me proceed.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So:

log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)

Which gives nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun )

So, nSi2 = nMg2 / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) ]

But since nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2, substituting:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun) ) * nH2? Wait, no.

Wait, nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 → because [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2.

So substituting into nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

The nMg_sun cancels:

nSi2 = [ (nH2 / nH_sun) * 1 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (1 / nSi_sun) ) ]

Wait, let me clarify. Let me reorganize:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH2) / nH_sun ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

=> nSi2 = [ nH2 / nH_sun ] * [ nMg_sun / nMg_sun ] * [ nSi_sun / 10^{0.3} ]

Simplifying, nMg_sun cancels, so:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3}

So, nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3}

Wait, now I have expressions for nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1, nH2, and nSi_sun.

But I need the ratio nSi1 / nSi2.

So let's write that:

nSi1 / nSi2 = [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun ] * [ (nH_sun / nH2 ) * 10^{0.3} / nSi_sun ) ]

nSi_sun cancels.

= [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * (nH_sun / nH2) ) ] * (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} )

= (nH1 / nH2) ) * 10^{0.6}

But wait, what about the nH ratio? Are we assuming that the hydrogen densities of the two stars are the same as the Sun's?

Wait, no. The nH is the local hydrogen density in each star's photosphere. Without knowing the actual value, perhaps we can relate nH1 and nH2 through some other means. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same hydrogen density, but that's not stated.

Wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the surface gravity and temperature affect the scale height and the density. But without knowing these factors, perhaps we can assume that the ratio of hydrogen between the two stars is the same as their mass ratio? Hmm, not necessarily. Because surface gravity (g) is proportional to mass / radius². But without knowing the radius, which isn't provided, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out, but I don't see how yet.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

(nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.6}

But if the stars have the same surface gravity and temperature, their nH could be the same. But that's probably not the case; higher mass stars are usually larger in radius, but not always. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, meaning both stars have the same hydrogen density as each other. But I don't think that's a valid assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the same nH for both stars, but I don't think that's given. Alternatively, maybe the nH is the same as the Sun's, but that would mean nH1 = nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun, which would make the ratio (nH1/nH2) =1, but that would mean that the stars' hydrogen densities are same as the Sun's, which might not be the case.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go back and see if I can find nSi_sun from the given data.

Wait, for the Sun, I have nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, and nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

But I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun. How can I find that?

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun. Because [Mg/Si]_sun would be log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun =0, which is not helpful. Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun is just log(nMg/nSi)_sun, because the sun's own ratio is the reference. So [Mg/Si]_sun = 0.

Wait, but I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun, so perhaps I can't find nSi_sun from the given data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is the same as Star_2's [Mg/Si], but no, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, which is higher than solar.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, from the Sun's data:

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5.

nFe_sun /nH_sun =3.16e-5.

But I don't have nSi_sun /nH_sun.

Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption. Let's say that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is a certain value. But without data, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that nSi_sun is needed. Let me see.

Looking back at the expressions for nSi1 and nSi2:

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

( (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ) / ( (nH2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ) )

Simplifying:

= [ (nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ] 

Because nSi_sun cancels, and (nH1/nH_sun) / (nH2/nH_sun) is nH1/nH2.

Wait, 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} is 10^{0.6}.

So the ratio becomes:

(nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing the ratio of nH1 to nH2, I can't proceed further. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of hydrogen in the two stars' photospheres is the same as the ratio of their masses, but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of their hydrogen densities is the same as the solar ratio, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1. Let's test that assumption.

If nH1 =nH2, which would mean their hydrogen densities are the same, then the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, let me check. 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which matches.

But wait, I'm making an assumption that nH1 =nH2. Is that valid? I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem expects this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nH1 to nH2 using other information, such as the masses of the stars.

Hmm, stars' surface gravity (g) is given by g = G*M/(R^2), where M is mass, R radius.

The number density nH is proportional to g/(kT), where T is the temperature. But without knowing T, it's difficult.

Alternatively, for main-sequence stars, hotter stars are larger in radius, but again, without knowing the exact properties, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves using the fact that the [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, implying that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's, which could tie into some other ratio.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should compute the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 using the given data without worrying about nH1 and nH2.

Wait, let's try another approach.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So,

nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So,

nSi1 = (nFe_sun * nH1/nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

nSi1 = nH1/nH_sun * (nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So,

nMg2 = nSi2 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But nMg2 =nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So,

nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) = nSi2 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) *10^{0.3}.

Solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) *10^{0.3} ]

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

[ (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^{0.3} ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun ) * nSi_sun /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ]

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

Again, same expression as before.

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen densities (nH) are the same for both stars, which would make nH1 =nH2 → nH1/nH2 =1.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So option A is ~3.9.

But I'm not sure if this assumption is valid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where I can compute nH1/nH2 from the stars' masses and radii. But without knowing the radii, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Let me think.

The Sun's [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) – log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun =0. Because the Sun is the reference.

So [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun → which is trivial.

So perhaps I can't find the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] by other means. For example, if the Sun's Mg is 1e-5 nH, and Fe is 3.16e-5 nH, but I don't know Si.

Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is the same as Star_2's, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing nH1/nH2, but that seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1, which would make the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier and the ratio is actually (nSi1)/(nSi2) = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} ) =10^{0.6}.

Wait, because for Star_1: [Si/Fe] =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/(nFe_sun)).

And for Star_2: [Mg/Si] =0.3 → nMg2 = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But since [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Cancel nMg_sun:

nH2/nH_sun = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (1/nSi_sun).

So nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_1:

nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe] is 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substitute nFe1:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun * nH1/nH_sun) ) * 10^{0.3} (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

So the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nH1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun/10^{0.3} ]

= [ (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] 

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

Again, same result. Without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps the problem expects us to assume that nH1 =nH2 → which would make the ratio 10^{0.6} ≈3.98 → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I've missed some other information that allows me to find nH1 and nH2.

Wait, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that the overall metallicity is the same as the Sun's. But that doesn't directly relate to the hydrogen density.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} → ~3.98, which is option A.

Given that, and considering the options provided, I think the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and solar composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
1. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This implies that the Fe abundance in Star_1 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
2. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio,  
   \[
   \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}\right) + 0.3.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
   \]

### Star_2:
1. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This implies that the Mg abundance in Star_2 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
2. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio,  
   \[
   \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}\right) + 0.3.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen densities \( n_{\text{H,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{H,2}} \). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen densities in the two stars are the same, i.e., \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \). This assumption simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A) ~3.9**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, okay, let me break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the mass might not matter directly for the abundance calculations, unless it's about their lifetimes or something else, but the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe mass isn't a factor here. I'll focus on the abundance data.

The given abundances are using the EW (equivalent width) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). Let's list out what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no, I think it's [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log(nX/nY / (nX/nY)_sun) → which is log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) → which is log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → so their Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, Fe abundance is solar. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so [Fe/H]_1 = 0 →  log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0 → so log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So let me write down the solar values:

nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → approximately 3.16e-5.

nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-5) → 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, wait no. [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

But in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) → wait, no, wait. Let me think about it.

Wait, nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But nH is the hydrogen number density. So perhaps the hydrogen densities of the stars are different from the Sun's? But maybe we can ignore that because we're looking for the ratio of silicon in the two stars.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi1) / (nSi2) ?

Wait, but the question says 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.' So I think that's nSi1 / nSi2.

So I need to find nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of the solar values and the given [X/Y] values.

Let me approach each star step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) is log( (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) ) → log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = log( (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) ) → which is log( (nSi/nFe)_sun ) → which is log( (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) → since nH_sun cancels out.

Given that nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, and nMg_sun/nH_sun is 1e-5.

Wait, but what's nSi_sun/nH_sun? Hmm, from the Sun's composition, we know nFe/nH is given as (12 + log10(nFe/nH)) =7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about Si? Since the question doesn't provide [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps I can compute nSi_sun/nFe_sun.

Because [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)_sun. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The [X/Y] for the Sun would be zero because it's the reference.

Wait, no, the [X/Y] scale is relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_sun = 0. So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)_sun = 0. Wait, that's trivial.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's compute nSi1 and nSi2.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun) → because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But wait, nSi_sun/nFe_sun is the solar ratio. Let me compute that.

nSi_sun = ?

Wait, wait, from the Sun's data, I can only directly compute nFe and nMg. Maybe I can find nSi_sun from another ratio. Because the question gives [Mg/Si]_2 for Star 2, but not for Star 1.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is needed. Let's see. The Sun's [Mg/H] is 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Do I have the data? The question only gives for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, which gives nFe/nH = 3.16e-5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But no data on Si. Hmm, maybe I can assume that the Sun has a certain [Mg/Si], but I don't have that. Unless I'm supposed to compute it from the given data.

Wait, perhaps the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star 2 is given. But for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3. But Star_2's [Mg/H] is zero.

Wait, maybe I should compute nMg2 and then find nSi2 from [Mg/Si] = 0.3.

Hmm, perhaps I should find nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of their respective nH, using the given data.

Let me proceed step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Which rearranges to:

nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

So substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 ] * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

The nFe_sun cancels:

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

So nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

But I don't know nH1 or nH_sun. Wait, but maybe nH is proportional to the star's surface gravity and temperature, but perhaps we can treat the ratio nSi1/nSi2 by eliminating nH.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me proceed.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So:

log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)

Which gives nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun )

So, nSi2 = nMg2 / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) ]

But since nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2, substituting:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun) ) * nH2? Wait, no.

Wait, nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 → because [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2.

So substituting into nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

The nMg_sun cancels:

nSi2 = [ (nH2 / nH_sun) * 1 ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (1 / nSi_sun) ) ]

Wait, let me clarify. Let me reorganize:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH2) / nH_sun ] / [ 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

=> nSi2 = [ nH2 / nH_sun ] * [ nMg_sun / nMg_sun ] * [ nSi_sun / 10^{0.3} ]

Simplifying, nMg_sun cancels, so:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3}

So, nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3}

Wait, now I have expressions for nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1, nH2, and nSi_sun.

But I need the ratio nSi1 / nSi2.

So let's write that:

nSi1 / nSi2 = [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / 10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun ] * [ (nH_sun / nH2 ) * 10^{0.3} / nSi_sun ) ]

nSi_sun cancels.

= [ (nH1 / nH_sun) * (nH_sun / nH2) ) ] * (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} )

= (nH1 / nH2) ) * 10^{0.6}

But wait, what about the nH ratio? Are we assuming that the hydrogen densities of the two stars are the same as the Sun's?

Wait, no. The nH is the local hydrogen density in each star's photosphere. Without knowing the actual value, perhaps we can relate nH1 and nH2 through some other means. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same hydrogen density, but that's not stated.

Wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the surface gravity and temperature affect the scale height and the density. But without knowing these factors, perhaps we can assume that the ratio of hydrogen between the two stars is the same as their mass ratio? Hmm, not necessarily. Because surface gravity (g) is proportional to mass / radius². But without knowing the radius, which isn't provided, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out, but I don't see how yet.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

(nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.6}

But if the stars have the same surface gravity and temperature, their nH could be the same. But that's probably not the case; higher mass stars are usually larger in radius, but not always. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, meaning both stars have the same hydrogen density as each other. But I don't think that's a valid assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the same nH for both stars, but I don't think that's given. Alternatively, maybe the nH is the same as the Sun's, but that would mean nH1 = nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun, which would make the ratio (nH1/nH2) =1, but that would mean that the stars' hydrogen densities are same as the Sun's, which might not be the case.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go back and see if I can find nSi_sun from the given data.

Wait, for the Sun, I have nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, and nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

But I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun. How can I find that?

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun. Because [Mg/Si]_sun would be log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun =0, which is not helpful. Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun is just log(nMg/nSi)_sun, because the sun's own ratio is the reference. So [Mg/Si]_sun = 0.

Wait, but I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun, so perhaps I can't find nSi_sun from the given data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is the same as Star_2's [Mg/Si], but no, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, which is higher than solar.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, from the Sun's data:

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5.

nFe_sun /nH_sun =3.16e-5.

But I don't have nSi_sun /nH_sun.

Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption. Let's say that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is a certain value. But without data, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that nSi_sun is needed. Let me see.

Looking back at the expressions for nSi1 and nSi2:

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

( (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ) / ( (nH2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ) )

Simplifying:

= [ (nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ] 

Because nSi_sun cancels, and (nH1/nH_sun) / (nH2/nH_sun) is nH1/nH2.

Wait, 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} is 10^{0.6}.

So the ratio becomes:

(nH1 / nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing the ratio of nH1 to nH2, I can't proceed further. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of hydrogen in the two stars' photospheres is the same as the ratio of their masses, but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of their hydrogen densities is the same as the solar ratio, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1. Let's test that assumption.

If nH1 =nH2, which would mean their hydrogen densities are the same, then the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, let me check. 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which matches.

But wait, I'm making an assumption that nH1 =nH2. Is that valid? I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem expects this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nH1 to nH2 using other information, such as the masses of the stars.

Hmm, stars' surface gravity (g) is given by g = G*M/(R^2), where M is mass, R radius.

The number density nH is proportional to g/(kT), where T is the temperature. But without knowing T, it's difficult.

Alternatively, for main-sequence stars, hotter stars are larger in radius, but again, without knowing the exact properties, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves using the fact that the [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, implying that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's, which could tie into some other ratio.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should compute the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 using the given data without worrying about nH1 and nH2.

Wait, let's try another approach.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So,

nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So,

nSi1 = (nFe_sun * nH1/nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

nSi1 = nH1/nH_sun * (nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So,

nMg2 = nSi2 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But nMg2 =nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So,

nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) = nSi2 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) *10^{0.3}.

Solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) *10^{0.3} ]

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

[ (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^{0.3} ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun ) * nSi_sun /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ]

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

Again, same expression as before.

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen densities (nH) are the same for both stars, which would make nH1 =nH2 → nH1/nH2 =1.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So option A is ~3.9.

But I'm not sure if this assumption is valid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where I can compute nH1/nH2 from the stars' masses and radii. But without knowing the radii, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Let me think.

The Sun's [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) – log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun =0. Because the Sun is the reference.

So [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun → which is trivial.

So perhaps I can't find the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] by other means. For example, if the Sun's Mg is 1e-5 nH, and Fe is 3.16e-5 nH, but I don't know Si.

Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is the same as Star_2's, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing nH1/nH2, but that seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1, which would make the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier and the ratio is actually (nSi1)/(nSi2) = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} ) =10^{0.6}.

Wait, because for Star_1: [Si/Fe] =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/(nFe_sun)).

And for Star_2: [Mg/Si] =0.3 → nMg2 = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But since [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Cancel nMg_sun:

nH2/nH_sun = nSi2 *10^{0.3} * (1/nSi_sun).

So nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, for Star_1:

nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe] is 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substitute nFe1:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun * nH1/nH_sun) ) * 10^{0.3} (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

So the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nH1/nH_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun/10^{0.3} ]

= [ (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] 

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^{0.6}.

Again, same result. Without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps the problem expects us to assume that nH1 =nH2 → which would make the ratio 10^{0.6} ≈3.98 → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I've missed some other information that allows me to find nH1 and nH2.

Wait, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that the overall metallicity is the same as the Sun's. But that doesn't directly relate to the hydrogen density.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is 10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} =10^{0.6} → ~3.98, which is option A.

Given that, and considering the options provided, I think the answer is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and solar composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
1. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This implies that the Fe abundance in Star_1 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
2. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio,  
   \[
   \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}\right) + 0.3.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
   \]

### Star_2:
1. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This implies that the Mg abundance in Star_2 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
2. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio,  
   \[
   \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}\right) + 0.3.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{Si, sun}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen densities \( n_{\text{H,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{H,2}} \). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen densities in the two stars are the same, i.e., \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \). This assumption simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A) ~3.9**.
