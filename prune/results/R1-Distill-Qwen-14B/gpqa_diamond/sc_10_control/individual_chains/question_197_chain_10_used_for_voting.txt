Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are A to D. The data given are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H, but more likely O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, possibly from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C (aromatic) stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. And the O-H stretch suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broader, typically around 2500-3300 cm-1. But the IR here shows 3400–2500, which is a bit on the lower end. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol?

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. Let's break it down.

The peaks are at:
- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, but wait, a broad singlet could also sometimes be an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10. But aldehydes are usually more downfield. Wait, 10.5 would probably be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. Because an aldehyde is typically 9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and around 10-12. So maybe a carboxylic acid. But let me think more.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest each set is two Hs with the same substitution. So, for example, two Hs next to a substituent, like in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, maybe a CH next to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Or perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. Because around 2.9, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H). That could be a CH2 group, perhaps part of an ethyl or isopropyl group, maybe adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl or an oxygen.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H). A doublet for three Hs, so probably a CH3 group attached to a CH that's splitting the signal. So maybe a geminal group or a branch point. Like in an isopropyl group, where the CH is next to two CH3 groups. Or maybe a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H). A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, so probably an ethyl group where the CH2 is next to another CH2 or CH.

Putting this together: a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR), but wait, if the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl, but for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but it's possible. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So the compound has a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, but the IR shows 3400–2500, which is a strong O-H stretch, which would be consistent with a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps we have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Looking at the aromatic region NMR: 8.0 d (2H) and 7.2 d (2H). The downfield shift (8.0) suggests electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached. The upfield (7.2) suggests electron-donating groups (EDGs), but wait, in a para-substituted ring, maybe two substituents are present. Wait, no, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent affects the ring. Wait, but the question is, which substituents are present?

Wait, perhaps the benzene has a substituent that's an EWG and another substituent that's an EDG. But in this case, the two substituents are in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that's causing both shifts. Hmm.

Wait, the two doublets suggest that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each affecting the adjacent Hs. Let me think: in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. So, for example, if the substituent is a group like -COOH, which is a strong EWG, it would deshield the adjacent hydrogens, causing them to be more downfield. So the Hs next to -COOH would be at around 8 ppm (for example, in benzoic acid, the Hs ortho to COOH are around 7.5-8.5 ppm). Then, the substituent across would have a different effect. Hmm, but if it's a single substituent, like -COOH, then we'd have two Hs ortho to it, which are downfield, and the other two Hs (meta) would be less affected.

Wait, but in our NMR, we have two doublets: each is 2H. So perhaps the substituent is such that each pair is adjacent to substituents. Wait, maybe there's another substituent on the ring besides the -COOH. Like, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or perhaps it's a substituent that has a branching with a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. Let me think: if the substituent is a carbonyl, like -CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Then, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring, but then the IR would have a peak for the carbonyl. But in that case, the NMR would show the ketone's adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with an adjacent CH2 group. Let me think about the other NMR signals.

Looking at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm(t,3H). That looks a bit like a chain attached to the ring. Let me see: the 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, triplet would be from a CH2 next to a CH2. So maybe a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but the triplet is for the CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to it would be a quartet. But in our data, the 0.9 is triplet, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. So that's a CH3 attached to a CH. Because in a doublet, the CH3 is next to a CH with one neighboring proton. So, perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's isobutyl. So maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be a CH next to an electron-withdrawing group, like oxygen. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group attached to a CH group, which is then attached to a longer chain.

Wait, let me try to assemble this. The benzene ring has a substituent, say, -CO-R, where R is a chain. The R group would have a CH that's adjacent to the carbonyl. The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which could be that CH. Then, the chain continues: the CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 (could be the 1.4 ppm d, 3H), and then perhaps an ethyl group (the 0.9 ppm t, 3H).

Wait, but 1.7 is m, 2H, which would be a CH2 group. So let's think: the substituent is benzyl something like O-CO-R, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than a typical ketone (maybe around 1715), but could be an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the substituent would be COR where R is an alkyl group.

Putting this together: the molecule has a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) attached, and the ketone is connected to a chain. The chain would have a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, then a CH2, then another CH, and then a CH3 and an ethyl group.

Wait, but the substituent could also be a propionyl group, like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching.

Wait, let's look back at the NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): that's a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group. So the chain might end with CH2CH3.

Then, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 next to the branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3), but wait, not sure.

Alternatively, this could be an isobutyl group attached to the carbonyl. Because an isobutyl group has a CH(CH2CH3)2 structure, but wait, no, the NMR doesn't match that.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle. When the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's likely undergoing a reaction that converts a carbonyl group into something else. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters, or maybe for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid method for cleavage of carbonyl groups. Oh, wait, I think that's the case. So if the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would result in the cleavage of the carbonyl group, typically converting it into an alcohol or something else.

Wait, wait, I think the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the Wittig reaction, but that's when you use phosphorus ylides. Alternatively, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses HCl and Zn(Hg). So perhaps this is the hydroiodic acid reaction, which can cleave ketones.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used for the cleavage of alkenes, but when reacting with carbonyl groups, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, I think the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. For example, if the compound is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, another point: the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Let me think of possible functional groups. A ketone is around 1715, an ester maybe 1735-1745, but sometimes lower. A carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700-1725, but it's usually broader. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl is at around 1700 cm-1. The IR given is 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzophenone derivative. But that's just a thought.

Wait, let's try to structure the molecule. The benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to a chain. Let's try to imagine the substituent as -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe a chain like -CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, making it an ester. But then, the IR would be higher in wavenumber, around 1740, but our IR is at 1720, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So maybe that's the functional group. So the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Then, the rest of the substituent is a chain attached to the ring.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a -COOH proton as a broad peak. So that fits. The 10.5 ppm is the O-H of the carboxylic acid. Then, the substituent would be -COOH attached to the benzene. But then, what about the other signals?

Wait, the substituent would then have a chain attached to the ring. Let me think: the ring has a -COOH group and another substituent. Because without another substituent, the aromatic signals might not split into two doublets. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, one being the -COOH group and another being a alkyl group in the para position.

Wait, but how would that look? If the substituents are para, then each substituent would be across from the other. So the aromatic protons would be adjacent to each substituent. For example, if the substituents are -COOH and -R (like an ethyl group), then the Hs next to -COOH would be downfield (around 8 ppm), and the Hs next to -R would be upfield (maybe around 7.2 ppm), but it depends on the nature of R.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a chain attached.

Let me try to imagine the structure. The benzene ring has a carbonyl group attached, which is connected to a CH group. The CH is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should draw the possible structure based on the NMR data.

The aromatic region shows two doublets, each 2H. So the ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is -COOH, and the other is a chain that's branched.

The chain attached to the ring (let's say at the para position to the -COOH) would be a group that gives the other NMR signals. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH next to something (maybe the carbonyl or oxygen). The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, suggesting an ethyl group.

So putting this together, the substituent attached to the benzene (para to the -COOH) is a CH group connected to a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's a CH group connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, another approach: the signals suggest a structure like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CH(CH3) attached via a CH group. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring via the central CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with branching. For example, -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Looking at these, options C and A have benzoic acid groups. Options B and D are substituted benzene rings without a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a strong -COOH O-H. So that would suggest the product is a carboxylic acid. But the question is about the product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So the initial compound X has a certain structure, and the reaction changes it.

Wait, so Compound X is the starting material, and the reaction gives a product among the options.

So perhaps when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the functional group changes.

Wait, but what reaction occurs when you have X (which has a carbonyl group) reacting with red phosphorus and HI? My initial thought is that this is a cleavage reaction. Let me think: Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids and alcohols. Alternatively, they can be used for the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. For example, if X is an alkyne, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again: The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. This is a common reaction for the substitution of halides. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus is used in some substitution reactions, but another possibility is that this is a reaction to form an ylide for a Wittig reaction, but that's when you have a triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. If X is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But then, the product would have a -COOH group if X was an ester.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would fit if X was an ester that's hydrolyzed to benzoic acid upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone, and the reaction converts it into an alcohol. For example, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think more about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroiodolysis of alkenes. For example, in the presence of a diene, it can form allylic iodides. Alternatively, for carbonyl groups, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of an alcohol through the hydrolysis of the carbonyl group. Possibly, it's similar to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but that uses HCl and Zn.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a carbonyl group. For example, if X is an aldehyde or ketone, the reaction could break the carbonyl, forming an alcohol.

Wait, for example, if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the reaction would form benzyl alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols except perhaps option B or D, which are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, but X has a carbonyl group. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid from an ester. Suppose X is an ester, say, benzene ring with an ester group (like benzyl acetate). Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

In that case, the product would be a benzoic acid if the ester was attached to the ring. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring would have a -COOH group and a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

But wait, how would X look in that case? X would be the ester form, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. Then, upon hydrolysis, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But let's check the IR and NMR of X. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (since esters have carbonyls around 1735-1750, but it's close enough if it's a lower ester like methyl or ethyl). The O-H stretch in the IR would be in the 3400-2500 cm-1 range, but if X is an ester, why is there an O-H peak? Esters don't have O-H groups. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. If X is an ester, then the IR wouldn't show the broad O-H stretch unless there's another O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, perhaps X isn't an ester but a ketone.

If X is a ketone, then the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the ketone into an alcohol. How?

Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Let me think: the reaction of a ketone with HI and red phosphorus would yield an alcohol. For example, if X is a ketone like R-CO-R', the reaction would produce R-CH(OH)-R'.

So, the product would be an alcohol, which would have an -OH group. Looking at the options, options B and D are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups, while options A and C have functional groups (propanoic acid and benzoic acid, respectively).

Wait, but in our case, the reaction would produce an alcohol, which would have an -OH group. But none of the options except maybe A and C have functional groups. So perhaps this line of thinking is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm thinking of the reaction incorrectly. Another possibility is that X is a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the IR data because nitriles have a strong peak around 2250 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, X might be an aldehyde. The IR would show a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch, but the given IR doesn't show those. So that's unlikely.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to structure X based on the NMR data.

The benzene ring has substituents. The substituents result in two sets of doublets in the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So perhaps the substituents are in para positions, each with an EWG and EDG.

Wait, but the substituents could be a -COOH group and another group that's EDG, like -OCH3 or -CH3. But let's think about the other NMR signals.

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) suggests -COOH. Then, the other substituent is a chain that gives the other signals. So, the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The NMR signals after the aromatic region are:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H)

This looks like a chain that's something like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) indicates a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a pentyl group, but let me think.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, perhaps a CH next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, if the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH2 near the carbonyl would be split into a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. The next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH(CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm as the CH3. Wait, but the 1.4 is a doublet, so maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. For example, the substituent could be -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. For example, a -CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) as the CH3 attached to the CH. The CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), and the CH next to the carbonyl would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The terminal CH2CH3 would give the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So, putting it all together, the substituent attached to the benzene ring is a -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. So the benzene has substituents at the para positions: one is -COOH and the other is this chain.

Wait, but that can't be right because the substituent would be one group, not two. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a single group that includes both the carbonyl and the chain. So the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group connected to a branched chain.

So, the structure would be something like:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3

Wait, but where would the signals be in the NMR?

The carbonyl group would be at 1720 cm-1 in IR. The 10.5 ppm peak would be from an -OH, but if X has a carbonyl and an -OH, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the substituent is a -COOH group, then the chain attached would be part of the benzene ring's substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group, but that would make the chain shorter.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Ph–CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3

Then, the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But then the NMR would show the CH2 groups and the CH(CH3).

But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent ends with a CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be something like -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the substituent as a pentyl group with a branch, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring via the carbonyl. So, Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would give a longer chain, which may not fit the NMR.

Wait, the NMR has 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which is a triplet, so the CH3 is attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group with a branch.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent's structure.

Let me think about the reaction again. If X has a ketone group (-CO-) attached to a chain, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. So, the ketone (RCO-) would become an RCH(OH)- group.

So, the product after reaction would have an alcohol group (-OH) attached where the ketone was.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly show an alcohol. So perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But earlier, I thought that would require an O-H in X, which would be a carboxylic acid, but then why is the IR showing 1720 cm-1?

Wait, maybe X is an ester, and the product is a carboxylic acid. Let me think: if X is an ester, say Ph-CO-O-R, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to Ph-COOH and R-OH.

So, the product would be benzoic acid with a substituent. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride or an ester, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the NMR of X would then show an ester group, which would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which matches. The O-H stretch in IR would be from the ester's O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. Unless X has another O-H group, like an alcohol.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid O-H. So if X is an ester, how would it have a broad O-H peak? That doesn't fit. So perhaps this line of thought is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible structures in the options and see what their NMR and IR would look like.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position para. Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl) would be in position 4 relative to the COOH, which is in position 1. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

In this structure, the ring would have two substituents: COOH in position 1 and sec-butyl in position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, which are all influenced by the substituents.

The aromatic protons adjacent to the -COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the sec-butyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be shielded and appear upfield (around 7.2 ppm). That's consistent with the NMR data of 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H).

The IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 3400 cm-1, and the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid around 1700 cm-1. The given IR for X is 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Maybe that's because X is not the acid but the ester, but I'm not sure.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that doesn't make sense because the product is among the options, which includes option C as the same structure.

Wait, but the question is about the product after the reaction. So if X is the ester, the product would be the acid. But earlier thoughts suggest that X's IR wouldn't fit because an ester would have a higher carbonyl peak and no O-H.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. Let's imagine X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alcohol. So, the product would be a secondary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. These are substituted toluene derivatives.

Wait, but how would the reaction produce one of these?

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the reaction would form benzyl alcohol. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But earlier issues about the O-H in X's IR remain.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The product would have -COOH and a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring. If X is the ester of this acid, like the methyl ester, then hydrolysis would form the acid.

But X's IR would show a peak at 1720 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl and an O-H stretch around 3400-2500 cm-1. Wait, but esters don't have O-H; unless X is a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad O-H peak around 10 ppm in the NMR, which it does.

Wait, X's NMR has 10.5 ppm (bs,1H), which fits a carboxylic acid. So if X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change the -COOH group. Unless the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the carbonyl group but another part of the molecule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another thought: the reagent red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydroxylation of alkenes. But that's probably not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe X has a carbonyl and a leaving group, like an ester, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR and reaction.

The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent. The other substituent's NMR suggests a chain with a CH, CH2, CH3, and a terminal CH3 (the triplet).

So, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's imagine it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, making the structure Ph-sec-butyl with a -COOH group in the para position.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that's not one of the reaction options. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid.

Wait, but X's IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester than a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is the ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride or an ester, then the product after hydrolysis would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But looking at the NMR of X, which is the ester, the ester's O-H would not show up. So, that's contradictory because X's NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which indicates an -OH, likely from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps X is the acid already.

But then why would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do anything? Unless the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, which would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it to the acid.

But the NMR of X would not show an -OH peak if it's an acid chloride. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another angle: the reaction could be removing the carbonyl group. For example, if X is a ketone, the reaction could reduce the ketone to an alcohol, creating a new -OH group. Then, the product would have both -COOH and -OH.

But looking at the options, none of the products have two functional groups. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2OH group.

But again, the NMR doesn't support that because X's NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be an aldehyde proton. But an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, as a singlet. So perhaps that's possible.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which more likely indicates an -OH (like a carboxylic acid) than an aldehyde proton, which is usually sharp.

I'm getting more confused, but I think I need to make a decision based on the data.

Given that the NMR of X shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid O-H, and the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a ketone, but the O-H suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher, suggesting perhaps it's an ester. However, the O-H in the NMR contradicts that.

So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid with a substituent that also has a carbonyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the cleavage of esters or amides, producing carboxylic acids or amines. Alternatively, they can be used in the presence of alkenes to form allylic iodides.

But if X has an ester group, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an ester with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the ester form of this acid, the reaction would convert it into the acid, which is option C.

But X's NMR would need to fit an ester. Wait, the NMR of X shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an -OH, so X can't be an ester. Therefore, X must be the acid.

So, if X is the acid, what would the reaction do? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by an iodide, but I don't have evidence for that.

Wait, another thought: if X has a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen, the reaction could cause addition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would form an amine, but that doesn't fit the data.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The NMR data suggests a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a substituent that's a branched chain. The IR suggests a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or ester, but the NMR's O-H suggests a carboxylic acid.

If X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, unless it's another functional group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone and an -OH group. Then, the reaction could reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving a diol. But none of the options show a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide. But I don't know.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The IR and NMR of X would fit this structure if X is the acid. But then, what's the reaction doing?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the acid but another part. For example, if X has a substituent that's a methyl group, the reaction could convert it into a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts the isobutyl group into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some rearrangement, but I don't see the connection.

Given all this, I think the most plausible option is that X is an ester that hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So the product would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad O-H stretch in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- The strong carbonyl peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester. However, the broad O-H stretch strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- The aromatic region **(8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H)** indicates a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The signals **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** suggest a branched alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring. The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** indicates a terminal CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Reaction Analysis:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X already exhibits the spectral characteristics of a carboxylic acid (broad O-H and aromatic signals), it is likely that X is the ester form of the final product, which is hydrolyzed to the acid during the reaction.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid):** This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern in the aromatic region or the specific alkyl chain signals.
2. **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene):** This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
3. **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid):** This structure matches the data:
   - The para-substituted benzene explains the aromatic signals.
   - The sec-butyl chain explains the alkyl signals in the NMR.
   - The carboxylic acid functional group explains the IR and NMR signals.
4. **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene):** This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is likely the ester form of **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which undergoes hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI to form the carboxylic acid. This matches the spectral data and the reaction conditions.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are A to D. The data given are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H, but more likely O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, possibly from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C (aromatic) stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. And the O-H stretch suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broader, typically around 2500-3300 cm-1. But the IR here shows 3400–2500, which is a bit on the lower end. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol?

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. Let's break it down.

The peaks are at:
- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, but wait, a broad singlet could also sometimes be an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10. But aldehydes are usually more downfield. Wait, 10.5 would probably be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. Because an aldehyde is typically 9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and around 10-12. So maybe a carboxylic acid. But let me think more.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest each set is two Hs with the same substitution. So, for example, two Hs next to a substituent, like in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, maybe a CH next to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Or perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. Because around 2.9, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H). That could be a CH2 group, perhaps part of an ethyl or isopropyl group, maybe adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl or an oxygen.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H). A doublet for three Hs, so probably a CH3 group attached to a CH that's splitting the signal. So maybe a geminal group or a branch point. Like in an isopropyl group, where the CH is next to two CH3 groups. Or maybe a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H). A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, so probably an ethyl group where the CH2 is next to another CH2 or CH.

Putting this together: a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR), but wait, if the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl, but for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but it's possible. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So the compound has a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, but the IR shows 3400–2500, which is a strong O-H stretch, which would be consistent with a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps we have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Looking at the aromatic region NMR: 8.0 d (2H) and 7.2 d (2H). The downfield shift (8.0) suggests electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached. The upfield (7.2) suggests electron-donating groups (EDGs), but wait, in a para-substituted ring, maybe two substituents are present. Wait, no, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent affects the ring. Wait, but the question is, which substituents are present?

Wait, perhaps the benzene has a substituent that's an EWG and another substituent that's an EDG. But in this case, the two substituents are in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that's causing both shifts. Hmm.

Wait, the two doublets suggest that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each affecting the adjacent Hs. Let me think: in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. So, for example, if the substituent is a group like -COOH, which is a strong EWG, it would deshield the adjacent hydrogens, causing them to be more downfield. So the Hs next to -COOH would be at around 8 ppm (for example, in benzoic acid, the Hs ortho to COOH are around 7.5-8.5 ppm). Then, the substituent across would have a different effect. Hmm, but if it's a single substituent, like -COOH, then we'd have two Hs ortho to it, which are downfield, and the other two Hs (meta) would be less affected.

Wait, but in our NMR, we have two doublets: each is 2H. So perhaps the substituent is such that each pair is adjacent to substituents. Wait, maybe there's another substituent on the ring besides the -COOH. Like, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or perhaps it's a substituent that has a branching with a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. Let me think: if the substituent is a carbonyl, like -CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Then, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring, but then the IR would have a peak for the carbonyl. But in that case, the NMR would show the ketone's adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with an adjacent CH2 group. Let me think about the other NMR signals.

Looking at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm(t,3H). That looks a bit like a chain attached to the ring. Let me see: the 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, triplet would be from a CH2 next to a CH2. So maybe a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but the triplet is for the CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to it would be a quartet. But in our data, the 0.9 is triplet, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. So that's a CH3 attached to a CH. Because in a doublet, the CH3 is next to a CH with one neighboring proton. So, perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's isobutyl. So maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be a CH next to an electron-withdrawing group, like oxygen. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group attached to a CH group, which is then attached to a longer chain.

Wait, let me try to assemble this. The benzene ring has a substituent, say, -CO-R, where R is a chain. The R group would have a CH that's adjacent to the carbonyl. The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which could be that CH. Then, the chain continues: the CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 (could be the 1.4 ppm d, 3H), and then perhaps an ethyl group (the 0.9 ppm t, 3H).

Wait, but 1.7 is m, 2H, which would be a CH2 group. So let's think: the substituent is benzyl something like O-CO-R, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than a typical ketone (maybe around 1715), but could be an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the substituent would be COR where R is an alkyl group.

Putting this together: the molecule has a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) attached, and the ketone is connected to a chain. The chain would have a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, then a CH2, then another CH, and then a CH3 and an ethyl group.

Wait, but the substituent could also be a propionyl group, like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching.

Wait, let's look back at the NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): that's a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group. So the chain might end with CH2CH3.

Then, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 next to the branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3), but wait, not sure.

Alternatively, this could be an isobutyl group attached to the carbonyl. Because an isobutyl group has a CH(CH2CH3)2 structure, but wait, no, the NMR doesn't match that.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle. When the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's likely undergoing a reaction that converts a carbonyl group into something else. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters, or maybe for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid method for cleavage of carbonyl groups. Oh, wait, I think that's the case. So if the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would result in the cleavage of the carbonyl group, typically converting it into an alcohol or something else.

Wait, wait, I think the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the Wittig reaction, but that's when you use phosphorus ylides. Alternatively, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses HCl and Zn(Hg). So perhaps this is the hydroiodic acid reaction, which can cleave ketones.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used for the cleavage of alkenes, but when reacting with carbonyl groups, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, I think the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. For example, if the compound is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, another point: the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Let me think of possible functional groups. A ketone is around 1715, an ester maybe 1735-1745, but sometimes lower. A carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700-1725, but it's usually broader. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl is at around 1700 cm-1. The IR given is 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzophenone derivative. But that's just a thought.

Wait, let's try to structure the molecule. The benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to a chain. Let's try to imagine the substituent as -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe a chain like -CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, making it an ester. But then, the IR would be higher in wavenumber, around 1740, but our IR is at 1720, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So maybe that's the functional group. So the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Then, the rest of the substituent is a chain attached to the ring.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a -COOH proton as a broad peak. So that fits. The 10.5 ppm is the O-H of the carboxylic acid. Then, the substituent would be -COOH attached to the benzene. But then, what about the other signals?

Wait, the substituent would then have a chain attached to the ring. Let me think: the ring has a -COOH group and another substituent. Because without another substituent, the aromatic signals might not split into two doublets. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, one being the -COOH group and another being a alkyl group in the para position.

Wait, but how would that look? If the substituents are para, then each substituent would be across from the other. So the aromatic protons would be adjacent to each substituent. For example, if the substituents are -COOH and -R (like an ethyl group), then the Hs next to -COOH would be downfield (around 8 ppm), and the Hs next to -R would be upfield (maybe around 7.2 ppm), but it depends on the nature of R.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a chain attached.

Let me try to imagine the structure. The benzene ring has a carbonyl group attached, which is connected to a CH group. The CH is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should draw the possible structure based on the NMR data.

The aromatic region shows two doublets, each 2H. So the ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is -COOH, and the other is a chain that's branched.

The chain attached to the ring (let's say at the para position to the -COOH) would be a group that gives the other NMR signals. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH next to something (maybe the carbonyl or oxygen). The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, suggesting an ethyl group.

So putting this together, the substituent attached to the benzene (para to the -COOH) is a CH group connected to a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's a CH group connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, another approach: the signals suggest a structure like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CH(CH3) attached via a CH group. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring via the central CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with branching. For example, -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Looking at these, options C and A have benzoic acid groups. Options B and D are substituted benzene rings without a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a strong -COOH O-H. So that would suggest the product is a carboxylic acid. But the question is about the product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So the initial compound X has a certain structure, and the reaction changes it.

Wait, so Compound X is the starting material, and the reaction gives a product among the options.

So perhaps when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the functional group changes.

Wait, but what reaction occurs when you have X (which has a carbonyl group) reacting with red phosphorus and HI? My initial thought is that this is a cleavage reaction. Let me think: Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids and alcohols. Alternatively, they can be used for the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. For example, if X is an alkyne, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again: The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. This is a common reaction for the substitution of halides. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus is used in some substitution reactions, but another possibility is that this is a reaction to form an ylide for a Wittig reaction, but that's when you have a triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. If X is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But then, the product would have a -COOH group if X was an ester.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would fit if X was an ester that's hydrolyzed to benzoic acid upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone, and the reaction converts it into an alcohol. For example, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think more about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroiodolysis of alkenes. For example, in the presence of a diene, it can form allylic iodides. Alternatively, for carbonyl groups, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of an alcohol through the hydrolysis of the carbonyl group. Possibly, it's similar to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but that uses HCl and Zn.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a carbonyl group. For example, if X is an aldehyde or ketone, the reaction could break the carbonyl, forming an alcohol.

Wait, for example, if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the reaction would form benzyl alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols except perhaps option B or D, which are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, but X has a carbonyl group. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid from an ester. Suppose X is an ester, say, benzene ring with an ester group (like benzyl acetate). Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

In that case, the product would be a benzoic acid if the ester was attached to the ring. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring would have a -COOH group and a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

But wait, how would X look in that case? X would be the ester form, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. Then, upon hydrolysis, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But let's check the IR and NMR of X. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (since esters have carbonyls around 1735-1750, but it's close enough if it's a lower ester like methyl or ethyl). The O-H stretch in the IR would be in the 3400-2500 cm-1 range, but if X is an ester, why is there an O-H peak? Esters don't have O-H groups. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. If X is an ester, then the IR wouldn't show the broad O-H stretch unless there's another O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, perhaps X isn't an ester but a ketone.

If X is a ketone, then the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the ketone into an alcohol. How?

Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Let me think: the reaction of a ketone with HI and red phosphorus would yield an alcohol. For example, if X is a ketone like R-CO-R', the reaction would produce R-CH(OH)-R'.

So, the product would be an alcohol, which would have an -OH group. Looking at the options, options B and D are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups, while options A and C have functional groups (propanoic acid and benzoic acid, respectively).

Wait, but in our case, the reaction would produce an alcohol, which would have an -OH group. But none of the options except maybe A and C have functional groups. So perhaps this line of thinking is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm thinking of the reaction incorrectly. Another possibility is that X is a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the IR data because nitriles have a strong peak around 2250 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, X might be an aldehyde. The IR would show a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch, but the given IR doesn't show those. So that's unlikely.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to structure X based on the NMR data.

The benzene ring has substituents. The substituents result in two sets of doublets in the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So perhaps the substituents are in para positions, each with an EWG and EDG.

Wait, but the substituents could be a -COOH group and another group that's EDG, like -OCH3 or -CH3. But let's think about the other NMR signals.

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) suggests -COOH. Then, the other substituent is a chain that gives the other signals. So, the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The NMR signals after the aromatic region are:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H)

This looks like a chain that's something like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) indicates a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a pentyl group, but let me think.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, perhaps a CH next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, if the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH2 near the carbonyl would be split into a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. The next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH(CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm as the CH3. Wait, but the 1.4 is a doublet, so maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. For example, the substituent could be -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. For example, a -CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) as the CH3 attached to the CH. The CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), and the CH next to the carbonyl would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The terminal CH2CH3 would give the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So, putting it all together, the substituent attached to the benzene ring is a -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. So the benzene has substituents at the para positions: one is -COOH and the other is this chain.

Wait, but that can't be right because the substituent would be one group, not two. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a single group that includes both the carbonyl and the chain. So the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group connected to a branched chain.

So, the structure would be something like:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3

Wait, but where would the signals be in the NMR?

The carbonyl group would be at 1720 cm-1 in IR. The 10.5 ppm peak would be from an -OH, but if X has a carbonyl and an -OH, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the substituent is a -COOH group, then the chain attached would be part of the benzene ring's substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group, but that would make the chain shorter.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Ph–CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3

Then, the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But then the NMR would show the CH2 groups and the CH(CH3).

But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent ends with a CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be something like -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the substituent as a pentyl group with a branch, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring via the carbonyl. So, Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would give a longer chain, which may not fit the NMR.

Wait, the NMR has 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which is a triplet, so the CH3 is attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group with a branch.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent's structure.

Let me think about the reaction again. If X has a ketone group (-CO-) attached to a chain, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. So, the ketone (RCO-) would become an RCH(OH)- group.

So, the product after reaction would have an alcohol group (-OH) attached where the ketone was.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly show an alcohol. So perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But earlier, I thought that would require an O-H in X, which would be a carboxylic acid, but then why is the IR showing 1720 cm-1?

Wait, maybe X is an ester, and the product is a carboxylic acid. Let me think: if X is an ester, say Ph-CO-O-R, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to Ph-COOH and R-OH.

So, the product would be benzoic acid with a substituent. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride or an ester, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the NMR of X would then show an ester group, which would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which matches. The O-H stretch in IR would be from the ester's O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. Unless X has another O-H group, like an alcohol.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid O-H. So if X is an ester, how would it have a broad O-H peak? That doesn't fit. So perhaps this line of thought is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible structures in the options and see what their NMR and IR would look like.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position para. Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl) would be in position 4 relative to the COOH, which is in position 1. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

In this structure, the ring would have two substituents: COOH in position 1 and sec-butyl in position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, which are all influenced by the substituents.

The aromatic protons adjacent to the -COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the sec-butyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be shielded and appear upfield (around 7.2 ppm). That's consistent with the NMR data of 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H).

The IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 3400 cm-1, and the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid around 1700 cm-1. The given IR for X is 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Maybe that's because X is not the acid but the ester, but I'm not sure.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that doesn't make sense because the product is among the options, which includes option C as the same structure.

Wait, but the question is about the product after the reaction. So if X is the ester, the product would be the acid. But earlier thoughts suggest that X's IR wouldn't fit because an ester would have a higher carbonyl peak and no O-H.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. Let's imagine X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alcohol. So, the product would be a secondary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. These are substituted toluene derivatives.

Wait, but how would the reaction produce one of these?

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the reaction would form benzyl alcohol. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But earlier issues about the O-H in X's IR remain.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The product would have -COOH and a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring. If X is the ester of this acid, like the methyl ester, then hydrolysis would form the acid.

But X's IR would show a peak at 1720 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl and an O-H stretch around 3400-2500 cm-1. Wait, but esters don't have O-H; unless X is a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad O-H peak around 10 ppm in the NMR, which it does.

Wait, X's NMR has 10.5 ppm (bs,1H), which fits a carboxylic acid. So if X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change the -COOH group. Unless the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the carbonyl group but another part of the molecule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another thought: the reagent red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydroxylation of alkenes. But that's probably not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe X has a carbonyl and a leaving group, like an ester, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR and reaction.

The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent. The other substituent's NMR suggests a chain with a CH, CH2, CH3, and a terminal CH3 (the triplet).

So, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's imagine it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, making the structure Ph-sec-butyl with a -COOH group in the para position.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that's not one of the reaction options. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid.

Wait, but X's IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester than a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is the ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride or an ester, then the product after hydrolysis would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But looking at the NMR of X, which is the ester, the ester's O-H would not show up. So, that's contradictory because X's NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which indicates an -OH, likely from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps X is the acid already.

But then why would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do anything? Unless the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, which would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it to the acid.

But the NMR of X would not show an -OH peak if it's an acid chloride. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another angle: the reaction could be removing the carbonyl group. For example, if X is a ketone, the reaction could reduce the ketone to an alcohol, creating a new -OH group. Then, the product would have both -COOH and -OH.

But looking at the options, none of the products have two functional groups. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2OH group.

But again, the NMR doesn't support that because X's NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be an aldehyde proton. But an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, as a singlet. So perhaps that's possible.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which more likely indicates an -OH (like a carboxylic acid) than an aldehyde proton, which is usually sharp.

I'm getting more confused, but I think I need to make a decision based on the data.

Given that the NMR of X shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid O-H, and the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a ketone, but the O-H suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher, suggesting perhaps it's an ester. However, the O-H in the NMR contradicts that.

So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid with a substituent that also has a carbonyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the cleavage of esters or amides, producing carboxylic acids or amines. Alternatively, they can be used in the presence of alkenes to form allylic iodides.

But if X has an ester group, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an ester with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the ester form of this acid, the reaction would convert it into the acid, which is option C.

But X's NMR would need to fit an ester. Wait, the NMR of X shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an -OH, so X can't be an ester. Therefore, X must be the acid.

So, if X is the acid, what would the reaction do? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by an iodide, but I don't have evidence for that.

Wait, another thought: if X has a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen, the reaction could cause addition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would form an amine, but that doesn't fit the data.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The NMR data suggests a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a substituent that's a branched chain. The IR suggests a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or ester, but the NMR's O-H suggests a carboxylic acid.

If X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, unless it's another functional group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone and an -OH group. Then, the reaction could reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving a diol. But none of the options show a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide. But I don't know.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The IR and NMR of X would fit this structure if X is the acid. But then, what's the reaction doing?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the acid but another part. For example, if X has a substituent that's a methyl group, the reaction could convert it into a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts the isobutyl group into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some rearrangement, but I don't see the connection.

Given all this, I think the most plausible option is that X is an ester that hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So the product would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad O-H stretch in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- The strong carbonyl peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester. However, the broad O-H stretch strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- The aromatic region **(8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H)** indicates a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The signals **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** suggest a branched alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring. The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** indicates a terminal CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Reaction Analysis:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X already exhibits the spectral characteristics of a carboxylic acid (broad O-H and aromatic signals), it is likely that X is the ester form of the final product, which is hydrolyzed to the acid during the reaction.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid):** This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern in the aromatic region or the specific alkyl chain signals.
2. **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene):** This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
3. **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid):** This structure matches the data:
   - The para-substituted benzene explains the aromatic signals.
   - The sec-butyl chain explains the alkyl signals in the NMR.
   - The carboxylic acid functional group explains the IR and NMR signals.
4. **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene):** This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is likely the ester form of **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which undergoes hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI to form the carboxylic acid. This matches the spectral data and the reaction conditions.
