Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about atomic states and transitions.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to figure out the correct path and the probability.

First, the notation: |n, l, m⟩ where n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal or angular momentum quantum number, and m is the magnetic quantum number. So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0.

Dipole transitions are governed by selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition must be between states where n can change, but in a way that the photon emitted or absorbed carries the appropriate angular momentum and energy.

Wait, but hydrogen is a one-electron atom, so the selection rules mainly depend on the electron's transition. So the initial state is 3s (since l=0 corresponds to s orbital), and it's transitioning to 1s. So the electron emits two photons? Or maybe it's a two-step process with two dipole transitions.

Wait, the question says via two dipole transitions. So the process is |3,0,0⟩ → some intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. Each transition must follow the dipole selection rules.

So first transition: from n=3, l=0.

Possible transitions from l=0 (s orbital) can only go to l=1 (p orbital) because Δl must be ±1. So the first transition must go to a p orbital state.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |n',1,m'⟩. What n’ is possible?

The selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but I think for hydrogen, the possible transitions are not just limited by l, but also the energy levels. So from n=3, the electron can drop to lower n levels. But since the final state is n=1, maybe it goes through a state with n=2 first.

So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. Then the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible m transitions. The selection rules for m are Δm = 0, ±1.

So in the first transition, starting from m=0, the possible m' can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state can have m’ = -1, 0, or +1.

So the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩ where m is -1, 0, or +1.

Then, the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules here. From l=1 (p orbital) to l=0 (s orbital), which is allowed because Δl = -1. And for m, the transition must have Δm = 0, ±1. So in the second step, the initial m is either -1, 0, or 1, and the final m is 0. So Δm must be +1, 0, or -1 respectively.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial m is m_initial (from the intermediate state), and the final m is 0. So Δm = -m_initial. So let's see:

If the intermediate state is m = 0, then Δm would be 0, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is m = +1, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is m = -1, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.

So all three m values for the intermediate state are possible for the second transition.

But wait, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each possible intermediate state contributes to the total probability.

But the options only have specific paths. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. And the probability is 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. Probability 2/3.

Wait, but D's first step seems to have the same as A's. Wait, looking again: The first part says for D, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, then what? The way it's written for D is a bit unclear. The option says: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So same as A's path but different probability.

So I think the correct path is through |2,1,0⟩, but wait, the probability might not be 1/3 or 2/3.

Wait, perhaps each possible intermediate state contributes to the probability, and the total probability is the sum of the squares of the transition amplitudes for each possible path.

But to compute that, I think the probability for each possible intermediate state (m= -1, 0, +1) would contribute, and the total is the sum of their squares.

Wait, but for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩, each m has a certain probability. Then for each of those, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ would have another probability. So the total probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of (probability of first transition) * (probability of second transition from that intermediate).

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each possible path.

But I'm not sure about the exact calculation. I need to think about the possible dipole transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are determined by the square of the dipole matrix elements. The dipole matrix element is proportional to the integral of the initial wavefunction, the dipole operator (r·ε, where ε is the photon polarization vector), and the final wavefunction.

The matrix element for a dipole transition from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is zero unless the selection rules are satisfied.

The matrix element is also proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which depends on the angular momentum addition. So the matrix element for the dipole transition between two states is proportional to the integral involving spherical harmonics Y_{l_i m_i} and Y_{l_f m_f}.

So for an initial state |3,0,0⟩ and a transition to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix element would involve Y_0^0 and Y_1^m, multiplied by r (since the dipole operator is proportional to r times spherical harmonics, Y_1^k).

Wait, perhaps another way: The dipole operator components are proportional to r Y_{1}^m (for m = -1, 0, +1). So for each component, the matrix element is non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m'| r Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩ would be non-zero only if m' = m'' (since m conservation in the dipole operator, which has angular momentum 1).

Wait, no, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so the matrix element would have m' = m'' + m_initial. Wait, no, let me correct: when you have a matrix element ⟨n', l', m'| r Y_1^m'' |n, l, m⟩, you're integrating Y_{l'}^{m'} * r Y_{1}^{m''} Y_l^m.

So the integral would be non-zero only if m' = m + m''.

Because spherical harmonics multiplication rule: Y_a^b * Y_c^d = sum ... Y_{a+c}^{b+d} etc. So when you multiply Y_{l=0}^0 (since initial m is 0) with Y_{1}^m'' (from the dipole component), you get Y_{1}^{m''}.

So the product is Y_1^{m''}.

Then, when you multiply by Y_{l'=1}^{m'}, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''. Because the integral of Y_{1}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m''} would be non-zero only if m' = m''.

Wait, no, actually, the integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m''} * Y_{0}^0 would be non-zero only if m' = m'' (since Y_0^0 is 1, and Y_1^m'' is being multiplied by Y_1^m'). So the integral is non-zero only if m' = m''.

So for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩, the dipole matrix element is non-zero only if m' = m''.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components, each Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0, Y_1^1. So each component corresponds to m'' = -1, 0, +1.

So for each component of the dipole operator, you get a possible m' for the intermediate state.

So for each m'' in the dipole operator, you can have a transition with m' = m''.

So possible m' values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition can go to |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,+1⟩, each corresponding to a different dipole component.

Now, for each of these, the second transition must lead to |1,0,0⟩.

The second transition must have l=1 → l=0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed.

And for the m, from m' (intermediate state) to m_final=0.

So for each intermediate m', the second transition is from m' → 0.

Which requires Δm = -m', since final m is 0.

So for each intermediate m', the transition is allowed.

Now, the total probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of the product of the probabilities of each step.

But each step's probability depends on the square of the matrix elements for each transition.

So the total probability P is the sum over m' of |M1|² * |M2|², where M1 is the matrix element for the first transition and M2 for the second.

But I'm not sure exactly how to compute M1 and M2, but perhaps I can think about their relative contributions.

The matrix elements for the first transition (from 3→2, l=0→l=1) would be non-zero only for the three m' values as discussed.

Similarly, for each m', the matrix element for the second transition (from 2→1, l=1→l=0) would be non-zero only if m' is such that m_final = 0.

Wait, the second transition's matrix element is from |2,1,m'| → |1,0,0⟩.

Again, using the same logic, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m' - m'' = 0? Or is it m'' = m'?

Wait, same as before: the dipole operator component is Y_1^m''.

The initial state for the second transition is |2,1,m'⟩, and the final state is |1,0,0⟩.

So the matrix element ⟨1,0,0| r Y_1^m'' |2,1,m'⟩.

Which is non-zero only if 0 = m' + m'' (since initial m is m', and the dipole has m''; then final m is 0 = m' + m'' ? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the dipole operator has Y_1^m''.

The matrix element would involve Y_{1}^{m''} multiplied by Y_{1}^{m'}, and integrated against Y_{0}^0.

Wait, no: the integral is ∫ Y_0^0 * Y_1^m' * Y_1^m'' dΩ.

This integral is zero unless m'' = -m', because Y_0^0 is 1, so Y_1^m' * Y_1^m'' would have terms with L=2 (from 1+1=2) and L=0 (from |1-1|=0). But Y_0^0 is only present when the sum of m's is zero. So m' + m'' = 0.

So m'' = -m'.

So in the second transition, for the matrix element to be non-zero, the dipole component must have m'' = -m'.

Therefore, for each intermediate state m', the dipole component that allows the transition is m'' = -m'.

So for the second transition, the only allowed dipole component is m'' = -m'.

Therefore, for each m', the second transition can only use the dipole component m'' = -m'.

So now, considering both transitions, each has a certain number of allowed paths.

But let me think about the probabilities.

Each transition's probability depends on the square of the matrix element. The matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) are for each m' (−1,0,+1). Similarly, the second transition (2→1) depends on m'.

But perhaps the probabilities are symmetric for m' = +1 and m' = -1, but different for m' = 0.

Because m' = 0 would correspond to a dipole component m''=0 for the second transition.

But I'm not too sure about the exact probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe the transition probabilities are the same for m' = +1 and m' = -1, and different for m' = 0.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible paths.

Wait, but the options only give specific paths. For example, options A, B, C, D suggest only one intermediate state is taken.

So perhaps the correct path is via m'=0, because that's the only one that leads to the final state with m=0.

Wait, no, the other m' values can also lead to m=0 in the second transition.

Wait, but let's think for each intermediate state m':

1. Intermediate state m' = 0:

Second transition from m'=0 → m_final=0.

In this case, the dipole component m'' must be 0.

So the second transition's matrix element would be proportional to the integral involving Y_1^0 * Y_1^0.

2. Intermediate state m' = +1:

Second transition from m'=+1 → m_final=0.

So the dipole component m'' must be -1.

3. Intermediate state m' = -1:

Second transition from m'=-1 → m_final=0.

Dipole component m'' must be +1.

So each of the three m' states is possible, but the matrix elements would have different strengths.

I remember that in hydrogen, the transition probabilities are higher for m=0 because of the orientation symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dipole matrix element for the first transition (3→2) is the same for m' = +1 and m' = -1, and different for m' =0.

Wait, the matrix element for the first transition depends on the overlap between the initial state (3s) and the final state (2p), which has m' = -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^m'.

But Y_0^0 is 1, and Y_1^m' are the spherical harmonics. The integral ∫ Y_1^m' Y_0^0 dΩ = ∫ Y_1^m' dΩ, which is zero unless m'=0, because Y_1^m' is zero-averaged except when m'=0.

Wait, wait no: Y_1^m' is the spherical harmonic for l=1. The integral ∫ Y_1^m' dΩ is zero except when m'=0, because for m' ≠0, the function isn't spherically symmetric.

Wait, but the integral of Y_1^m' over all angles is zero except when m'=0.

Wait, no, because Y_1^m' is a function with angular dependence. The integral of Y_1^m' over the sphere is zero except when m' =0, because for m'≠0, the function varies with angle.

So for the first transition, the matrix element for m' =0 is non-zero, but for m' = ±1, the matrix element is zero?

Wait that can't be right, because that would imply only the m'=0 transition is allowed, but I thought that dipole transitions can have m changes of 0 or ±1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (Y_0^0).

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_2^m' * (Y_1^m'') * Y_0^0.

Wait, no, the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m' | r Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ⟨2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩, because the radial part would contribute a factor depending on n and l, but for our purposes, perhaps we can ignore the radial part for this argument.

So, ⟨2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩.

But |3,0,0⟩ is Y_0^0.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2}^{m'}* Y_{1}^{m''} Y_{0}^0 dΩ.

This integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Remember that the product Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 = Y_1^{m''}.

Then, when you multiply by Y_2^{m'}, the integral is non-zero only if m' = m'' and l=2 (from Y_2^m') is obtained from the product of Y_0^0 and Y_1^{m''}.

Wait, but the integral ∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 dΩ is zero unless the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. The product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} has l=1, m=m''.

Then integrating with Y_2^{m'} would require that 1 and 0 combine to give 2. But 0 (from Y_0^0) and 1 can only add up to 1 or 0, not 2. So, the integral must be zero.

Wait, that can't be right because dipole transitions do happen. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the selection.

Wait, maybe the correct selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, which is satisfied here (0→1). So how does that fit in?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the matrix element wrong. Let me think of it in terms of angular momentum coupling.

The matrix element involves the product Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0. This is Y_1^{m''}.

So when you multiply by Y_2^{m'}, the integral is ∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only if m' = m'' and 2 = 1 + 1, which isn't possible because 1+1=2, so yes, l=2 is allowed.

Wait, because 1 (from dipole) and 0 (from initial state) can combine to 1, but how do they combine to 2?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The initial state is l=0, so when you multiply Y_0^0 and Y_1^{m''}, you get Y_1^{m''}.

Then the integral is of Y_2^{m'} times Y_1^{m''}.

For this integral to be non-zero, the product Y_1^{m''} must have a component with l=2. But that's only possible if m' = m'' and l=2, but wait, the product of Y_1^m'' and Y_2^{m'} would require that 1 and 2 can combine to give a term with l= something. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the matrix element for dipole transitions between states with l=0 and l'=1 is non-zero only when the dipole component's m'' equals the intermediate state's m'.

Wait, maybe the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Because the initial state is m=0, so m'' can be -1, 0, +1. So the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Which means the first transition can go to |2,1,-1⟩ via m''=-1, |2,1,0⟩ via m''=0, and |2,1,1⟩ via m''=+1.

So three possible intermediates.

But if the first transition's matrix element is non-zero for each of these three m', then the second transition must also be considered.

For each m' = -1, 0, +1:

Second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

In the second transition, the matrix element is proportional to ⟨1,0,0| Y_1^m'' |2,1,m'⟩.

Again, the dipole operator has m'' = -1, 0, +1.

The integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' Y_1^{m'} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only if m'' = -m' (because 0 = m' + m'' → m'' = -m').

So for each m', the dipole component in the second transition must have m'' = -m'.

So for m'=0, m''=0.

For m'=+1, m''=-1.

For m'=-1, m''=+1.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions.

But the probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements.

The matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) and the second (2→1) each have different magnitudes.

I think for hydrogen, the matrix elements are proportional to certain factors, such as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=1, m'⟩ = |l=2, m''⟩ × |l=1, m_1⟩.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(1, m') (2, 0) (1, m'').

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the integral of Y_2^m' Y_1^m'' Y_0^0.

Which relates to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the product Y_1^m'' Y_0^0 = Y_1^m''.

The integral of Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} is non-zero only if m' = m'' and 2 = 1 + 1? I don't think that's right, because 1 and 0 combine to give 1, not 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the product of the spherical harmonics.

The electric dipole matrix element ⟨n', l', m'| r |n, l, m⟩ is proportional to √( (l (l+1) - l' (l' +1) + 1 )/( 2 (2l +1)(2l' +1) )) ) × something with m.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of possible paths.

Each of the three intermediates (m' = -1, 0, +1) contributes to the total probability. The probabilities for each are not the same because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients differ.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities for m'=0 is higher than for m'=±1.

Wait, I'm recalling that the transition probability for the 3s → 2p state is higher for m'=0, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is zero for m'=±1 because of some symmetry.

Wait, no, that can't be because hydrogen emits photons in all directions, but the matrix elements might be zero for certain m' due to symmetry.

Wait, maybe the integral for m'=±1 is zero. Let me think again.

The initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0). The dipole operator has components in the x, y, and z directions. The first transition can only change m by ±1 or 0.

But the matrix element for m'=±1 might be zero because the integral ∫ Y_2^{±1} Y_1^{±1} Y_0^0 dΩ is zero.

Wait, because for the first transition, the initial state is Y_0^0, and the dipole operator is Y_1^m. So the product is Y_1^m.

The final state is Y_2^{m'}, so the integral is of Y_2^{m'} Y_1^m.

Which is non-zero only if m' = m and l=2 is formed from combining l=1 and l=0.

Wait, but l=0 and l=1 can only combine to l=1, not l=2. So the integral would be zero for l'=2 and l=1 → l' can't be 2.

Wait, that can't be right because the transition does happen. Oh, wait, the dipole operator has l=1. The initial state is l=0, so the product is Y_1^m. Then, the final state is l'=1, so the integral of Y_1^{m'} Y_1^m dΩ would be non-zero only if m'=m and 1=1.

Wait, but the initial state transition is from l=0 to l=1, so l'=1. So the product Y_0^0 Y_1^m = Y_1^m.

The final state is Y_1^{m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^m dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m.

So that means the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m'=m''.

So for each dipole component m'' (−1,0,+1), the transition is allowed to m'=m''.

So the first transition can go to m'=−1, 0, +1.

Each of these has a certain probability.

But in the integral for the first transition's matrix element, Y_1^m'' is integrated with Y_1^{m'}.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the matrix element is non-zero, and the second transition can proceed.

Now, for the second transition, from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

As discussed earlier, the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = −m'.

So each of the three intermediates contributes.

But what is the relative strength of these matrix elements?

The probability for each path is proportional to the square of the matrix elements for each step.

So perhaps the first transition's matrix element depends on m' as follows:

The matrix element for the 3→2 transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for m'=m''.

Similarly, the second transition's matrix element is proportional to another Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities are symmetric for m'=±1, and m'=0 has a different value.

I think that the transition to m'=0 is more probable than the others because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=0 are larger.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of known transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the allowed transitions for 3s →2p are to p states with m=-1,0,+1.

But when considering the transition from 2p to 1s, each of these m' states can transition to 1s (m=0) as long as the dipole component m'' is −m'.

So, each of the three paths is possible.

The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

If each path has the same probability, the total would be 3*(probability of each).

But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the same for m'=0 and different for m'= ±1.

Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 transition is allowed for the first step, but that can't be right because the dipole operator can cause m changes of 0, ±1.

Wait, maybe the first transition's matrix element is zero for m' =±1.

Because the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), and the dipole operator is l=1. The product Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' is Y_1^m''.

The final state after first transition is Y_1^{m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m''} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m''.

But for the 3→2 transition, the final state is l'=1. So the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So for each dipole component (m''=−1,0,+1), m' must equal m''.

Thus, the first transition can go to m' = −1, 0, +1.

But now, the integral of Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m''} is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the first transition is allowed for all three m' values.

But the question is about what's the probability of each path.

Now, the probabilities would be determined by the square of the matrix elements for each step.

In the first transition, the matrix element for m' =0 would be larger than for m'=±1 because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 is larger.

Similarly, for the second transition, the matrix element would be different for m'=0, +1, -1.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the dominant contribution comes from m'=0.

So the first transition is more probable for m'=0, and the second transition would have a certain probability.

So let's estimate: the first transition's probability for m'=0 is higher.

Then, the second transition from m'=0 to m=0 would have a certain probability.

But the options suggest specific paths.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: same as A, but probability 2/3.

If the first transition has three possible paths, each with certain probabilities, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the squares of their amplitudes.

Assume that the first transition to m'=0 has a higher probability than the others.

Let me think about the possible Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 (intermediate state).

The coefficient C(l=1, m') = C(1, m') (1,0) (1, m'').

Wait, no, perhaps better to think of the transition in terms of the Wigner 3-j symbols.

But I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps the transition probabilities are proportional to the squares of the matrix elements.

The matrix element for the first transition is proportional to ⟨2,1,m'| r |3,0,0⟩.

Which would involve the integral of Y_2^{m'} * Y_1^{m''} * Y_0^0.

As earlier, this is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Therefore, for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = m'.

Wait, but Y_1^{m''} is part of the dipole operator.

Hmm.

Another idea: the transition probability from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is proportional to (2l_i +1)(2l_f +1) δ_{l_i,l_f ±1} δ_{m_i, m_f ±1}.

Wait, no, that's more about the selection rules than the probability.

Alternatively, the electric dipole transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the overlap integral.

Perhaps the transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 (intermediate state) is:

C(1, m') (1, 0) (1, m'') = √( (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ) ... ?

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=1, m'⟩ = |l=1, m''⟩ × |l=0, 0⟩ is:

C(1, m') (1, 0) (1, m'') = √( ( (1 +1)! ) / ( (1 -1 +1)! (1 +1 -1 +1)! )) )) × something.

Wait, the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is:

C(j, m) (j1, m1) (j2, m2) = √( ( (2j+1) (j1 + j2 - j)! ) / ( (j1 - j + j2 + j)! (j1 + j2 + j)! ) ) )) × (-1)^{j1 - j2 + j} ... ?

I'm getting stuck here, perhaps it's better to think of specific cases.

For m' =0: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,0⟩ from |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩ is 1.

For m' =1: The coefficient is √( ( (1+1) ) / (2) ) ) × something.

Wait, perhaps for m'=0, the coefficient is 1.

For m'=1, it's √( ( (1+1) ) / (1+1+1) ) ) ? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,1⟩ from |1,1⟩ and |0,0⟩ is 1.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the matrix elements are largest for m'=0, and smaller for m'=±1.

Assuming that the matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) are largest for m'=0, and smaller for others.

Similarly, for the second transition from m'=0, the matrix element is larger than for m'=±1.

So the path through m'=0 would contribute more to the total probability.

But without exact numbers, perhaps the probabilities are of the order 1/3 each for the three paths, summing to 1.

But the options only give specific paths.

Looking at the options, option A and D have the same path (m'=0), but different probabilities.

Option A: probability 1/3.

Option D: probability 2/3.

So if the total probability is the sum of the three paths, each with 1/3, then the correct path is A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 path is allowed, giving a probability of 1.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 transition is allowed in the first step, but that can't be because the dipole operator allows m=±1.

Alternatively, maybe the probability for the m'=0 path is higher, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the possible transitions in hydrogen.

In hydrogen, the 3s → 2p transitions are allowed, and then 2p → 1s transitions are allowed.

The 3s → 1s transition would require two steps: 3s → 2p → 1s.

In the first step, 3s → 2p, which can go to 2p_{-1}, 2p_0, 2p_+1.

Then, each of these can transition to 1s.

In the second step, 2p_{m'} → 1s: m' must change by ±1 or 0 to reach m=0.

So, for each m' in 2p, there's a transition.

The probabilities are determined by the square of the matrix elements.

In hydrogen, the 3s → 2p transition has the highest probability for m'=0, because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is largest there.

Similarly, the 2p →1s transition would have highest probability when m'=0.

So the total probability would be the sum for each m' of |M1|^2 * |M2|^2.

Assuming M1 is largest for m'=0, and M2 is largest for m'=0, the dominant contribution would come from m'=0.

So the transition via m'=0 would have the highest probability.

So the correct path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Looking at the options, that's option A and D.

But what's the probability in option A: 1/3; option D: 2/3.

So which one is it?

If the first transition's probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is 1 for m'=0, and other values for m' = ±1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 and m'=0 is 1.

Similarly, for m'=±1, the coefficients are √( ( (1 +0 +1) ) )? Maybe not.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition (3→2) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(1, m') (1, m''=m') (0,0).

Which for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 is sqrt( ( (1)(1+1) ) / ( (1 +1) ) )) → sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2.

So the matrix element for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 is 1/√2.

Thus, the square of the matrix elements for the first transition are:

m'=0: 1² = 1.

m'=±1: (1/√2)² = 1/2.

So the first transition's probabilities for each m' are:

m'=0: 1/(1 + 1/2 + 1/2) )= 1/ (2) → probability is 1/2.

m'=±1: 1/2 each → each has probability 1/4.

So the first transition has m'=0 with probability 1/2, and m'=±1 each with 1/4.

Now, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element for the second transition also depends on m'.

Assuming that the second transition's matrix element is largest when m'=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the second transition is C(0,0) (1,m') (1, m''=-m').

Wait, the second transition's matrix element is proportional to C(0,0) (1, m') (1, m''= -m').

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 (m') and l=1 (m''= -m') to get l=0 and m=0.

The coefficient is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^{m'} [ ( (1 - m') (1 + m') ) / (2 (2m')^2 ) ) ]^(1/2) ?

Alternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l=0, m=0 from l=1, m' and l=1, m''= -m' is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^{m'} sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| ) (1 + |m'| ) ) / (2 (2)^2) )) ).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling two states with l1=1, m1 = m' and l2=1, m2 = -m' to get l=0, m=0 is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^m' sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| ) (1 + |m'| )) / (2 (2)^2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute for each possible m':

For m'=0:

C(0,0) (1,0) (1,0) = 1.

Because combining two l=1, m=0 states to get l=0, m=0 is allowed.

For m'=+1:

C(0,0) (1,1) (1,-1) = sqrt( ( (1)(2) ) / (2 (2)^2) )) ) * (-1)^1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the coefficient for l=0, m=0 from two l=1 states with m=+1 and m=-1 is sqrt( ( (1)(2) ) / (2*(2)^2) )) ) * (-1)^{1}.

Wait, I think the correct value is sqrt( (1 * (1 + 1 +1 )) )) / something, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for |0,0⟩ from |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ is sqrt(2/3) * (-1)^1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for two p orbitals combining to form s (l=0) and d (l=2):

The s state (l=0) from p and p: the coefficients are known.

The combination for |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ gives |0,0⟩ with CG coefficient sqrt( (1 * 2)/( (1 +1 +1) )) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the matrix elements for the dipole transitions.

The electric dipole transition from 3s to 2p.

The matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_1^m'' Y_0^0 Y_2^{m'}.

Which for m''=m' is non-zero.

So the transition probabilities are proportional to |∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 dΩ |^2.

Which is largest for m'=0 because Y_2^0 is the largest.

Therefore, the first transition's probability is highest for m'=0.

Similarly, for the second transition, the matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} Y_1^{m'}.

Which is non-zero only when m'' = -m'.

The integral is largest when m'=0.

So the second transition's probability is highest when m'=0.

Thus, the path through m'=0 has the largest contribution, but the other paths also contribute.

Now, the total probability P is:

P = sum_{m'} [ |M1(m')|^2 * |M2(m')|^2 ]

Assuming that M1(m') is the first transition's matrix element for m', and M2(m') is the second transition's matrix element for m'.

From earlier, M1(m') for the first transition has |M1(0)|^2 = 1, |M1(±1)|^2 = 1/2.

For the second transition, M2(m'):

For m'=0, |M2(0)|^2 is maximum, perhaps 1.

For m'=±1, |M2(±1)|^2 might be smaller.

But without exact values, perhaps the dominant term is the m'=0 path, contributing 1 * 1 = 1.

But that can't be because the other paths contribute as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for the second transition are the same for all m'.

Thus, the total probability would be:

(1/2 * a^2) + (1/4 * b^2) + (1/4 * c^2)

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the 3s → 2p transition has a certain probability distribution, and then the 2p →1s transition has another.

The total probability for the entire process is the sum over all possible intermediate states.

But I remember that in the case of the 3s → 2p →1s transition, the probability is higher for certain paths.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each dipole transition is 1/3, but in reality, the probabilities are more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think about it is that in the first transition, the probability is 1/2 for m'=0, and 1/4 each for m'=±1. Then, in the second transition, each m' has a certain probability.

Assuming that for the second transition, each m' has a 1/3 chance, the total would be:

(1/2 * 1/3) + (1/4 *1/3) + (1/4 *1/3) = (1/6 + 1/12 +1/12 )= (2/12 + 1/12 +1/12 )= 4/12= 1/3.

So the total probability would be 1/3.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A: probability 1/3.

The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in hydrogen to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The process occurs in two steps: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must satisfy the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and First Transition**:
   - The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0). 
   - The first transition must go to a state with l=1 (p orbital) because Δl = ±1. Thus, the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

2. **Second Transition**:
   - The second transition must go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. This requires Δl = -1 (from l=1 to l=0) and Δm = -m (since the final state has m=0).

3. **Selection of Intermediate State**:
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ can have m = -1, 0, or +1. Each of these states contributes to the total probability of the decay process.
   - The probability of each path depends on the square of the matrix elements for the two transitions. The matrix elements are proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers.

4. **Probability Contributions**:
   - The first transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩) has different probabilities for m = -1, 0, +1. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are largest for m=0, making this path more probable.
   - The second transition (|2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) also depends on m. The probability is largest for m=0 because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=±1 are smaller.

5. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the sum of the contributions from all possible intermediate states. The dominant contribution comes from the path through m=0, as it has the largest matrix elements for both transitions.
   - The total probability for the decay is proportional to the contributions from all three intermediate states. After accounting for the relative probabilities, the total probability is found to be **1/3**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the probability for m=+1 is smaller than for m=0.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for similar reasons as Option B.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about atomic states and transitions.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to figure out the correct path and the probability.

First, the notation: |n, l, m⟩ where n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal or angular momentum quantum number, and m is the magnetic quantum number. So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0.

Dipole transitions are governed by selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition must be between states where n can change, but in a way that the photon emitted or absorbed carries the appropriate angular momentum and energy.

Wait, but hydrogen is a one-electron atom, so the selection rules mainly depend on the electron's transition. So the initial state is 3s (since l=0 corresponds to s orbital), and it's transitioning to 1s. So the electron emits two photons? Or maybe it's a two-step process with two dipole transitions.

Wait, the question says via two dipole transitions. So the process is |3,0,0⟩ → some intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. Each transition must follow the dipole selection rules.

So first transition: from n=3, l=0.

Possible transitions from l=0 (s orbital) can only go to l=1 (p orbital) because Δl must be ±1. So the first transition must go to a p orbital state.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |n',1,m'⟩. What n’ is possible?

The selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but I think for hydrogen, the possible transitions are not just limited by l, but also the energy levels. So from n=3, the electron can drop to lower n levels. But since the final state is n=1, maybe it goes through a state with n=2 first.

So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. Then the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible m transitions. The selection rules for m are Δm = 0, ±1.

So in the first transition, starting from m=0, the possible m' can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state can have m’ = -1, 0, or +1.

So the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩ where m is -1, 0, or +1.

Then, the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules here. From l=1 (p orbital) to l=0 (s orbital), which is allowed because Δl = -1. And for m, the transition must have Δm = 0, ±1. So in the second step, the initial m is either -1, 0, or 1, and the final m is 0. So Δm must be +1, 0, or -1 respectively.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial m is m_initial (from the intermediate state), and the final m is 0. So Δm = -m_initial. So let's see:

If the intermediate state is m = 0, then Δm would be 0, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is m = +1, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.

If the intermediate state is m = -1, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.

So all three m values for the intermediate state are possible for the second transition.

But wait, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each possible intermediate state contributes to the total probability.

But the options only have specific paths. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. And the probability is 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. Probability 2/3.

Wait, but D's first step seems to have the same as A's. Wait, looking again: The first part says for D, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, then what? The way it's written for D is a bit unclear. The option says: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So same as A's path but different probability.

So I think the correct path is through |2,1,0⟩, but wait, the probability might not be 1/3 or 2/3.

Wait, perhaps each possible intermediate state contributes to the probability, and the total probability is the sum of the squares of the transition amplitudes for each possible path.

But to compute that, I think the probability for each possible intermediate state (m= -1, 0, +1) would contribute, and the total is the sum of their squares.

Wait, but for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩, each m has a certain probability. Then for each of those, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ would have another probability. So the total probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of (probability of first transition) * (probability of second transition from that intermediate).

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each possible path.

But I'm not sure about the exact calculation. I need to think about the possible dipole transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are determined by the square of the dipole matrix elements. The dipole matrix element is proportional to the integral of the initial wavefunction, the dipole operator (r·ε, where ε is the photon polarization vector), and the final wavefunction.

The matrix element for a dipole transition from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is zero unless the selection rules are satisfied.

The matrix element is also proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which depends on the angular momentum addition. So the matrix element for the dipole transition between two states is proportional to the integral involving spherical harmonics Y_{l_i m_i} and Y_{l_f m_f}.

So for an initial state |3,0,0⟩ and a transition to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix element would involve Y_0^0 and Y_1^m, multiplied by r (since the dipole operator is proportional to r times spherical harmonics, Y_1^k).

Wait, perhaps another way: The dipole operator components are proportional to r Y_{1}^m (for m = -1, 0, +1). So for each component, the matrix element is non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m'| r Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩ would be non-zero only if m' = m'' (since m conservation in the dipole operator, which has angular momentum 1).

Wait, no, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so the matrix element would have m' = m'' + m_initial. Wait, no, let me correct: when you have a matrix element ⟨n', l', m'| r Y_1^m'' |n, l, m⟩, you're integrating Y_{l'}^{m'} * r Y_{1}^{m''} Y_l^m.

So the integral would be non-zero only if m' = m + m''.

Because spherical harmonics multiplication rule: Y_a^b * Y_c^d = sum ... Y_{a+c}^{b+d} etc. So when you multiply Y_{l=0}^0 (since initial m is 0) with Y_{1}^m'' (from the dipole component), you get Y_{1}^{m''}.

So the product is Y_1^{m''}.

Then, when you multiply by Y_{l'=1}^{m'}, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''. Because the integral of Y_{1}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m''} would be non-zero only if m' = m''.

Wait, no, actually, the integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m''} * Y_{0}^0 would be non-zero only if m' = m'' (since Y_0^0 is 1, and Y_1^m'' is being multiplied by Y_1^m'). So the integral is non-zero only if m' = m''.

So for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩, the dipole matrix element is non-zero only if m' = m''.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components, each Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0, Y_1^1. So each component corresponds to m'' = -1, 0, +1.

So for each component of the dipole operator, you get a possible m' for the intermediate state.

So for each m'' in the dipole operator, you can have a transition with m' = m''.

So possible m' values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition can go to |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,+1⟩, each corresponding to a different dipole component.

Now, for each of these, the second transition must lead to |1,0,0⟩.

The second transition must have l=1 → l=0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed.

And for the m, from m' (intermediate state) to m_final=0.

So for each intermediate m', the second transition is from m' → 0.

Which requires Δm = -m', since final m is 0.

So for each intermediate m', the transition is allowed.

Now, the total probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of the product of the probabilities of each step.

But each step's probability depends on the square of the matrix elements for each transition.

So the total probability P is the sum over m' of |M1|² * |M2|², where M1 is the matrix element for the first transition and M2 for the second.

But I'm not sure exactly how to compute M1 and M2, but perhaps I can think about their relative contributions.

The matrix elements for the first transition (from 3→2, l=0→l=1) would be non-zero only for the three m' values as discussed.

Similarly, for each m', the matrix element for the second transition (from 2→1, l=1→l=0) would be non-zero only if m' is such that m_final = 0.

Wait, the second transition's matrix element is from |2,1,m'| → |1,0,0⟩.

Again, using the same logic, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m' - m'' = 0? Or is it m'' = m'?

Wait, same as before: the dipole operator component is Y_1^m''.

The initial state for the second transition is |2,1,m'⟩, and the final state is |1,0,0⟩.

So the matrix element ⟨1,0,0| r Y_1^m'' |2,1,m'⟩.

Which is non-zero only if 0 = m' + m'' (since initial m is m', and the dipole has m''; then final m is 0 = m' + m'' ? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the dipole operator has Y_1^m''.

The matrix element would involve Y_{1}^{m''} multiplied by Y_{1}^{m'}, and integrated against Y_{0}^0.

Wait, no: the integral is ∫ Y_0^0 * Y_1^m' * Y_1^m'' dΩ.

This integral is zero unless m'' = -m', because Y_0^0 is 1, so Y_1^m' * Y_1^m'' would have terms with L=2 (from 1+1=2) and L=0 (from |1-1|=0). But Y_0^0 is only present when the sum of m's is zero. So m' + m'' = 0.

So m'' = -m'.

So in the second transition, for the matrix element to be non-zero, the dipole component must have m'' = -m'.

Therefore, for each intermediate state m', the dipole component that allows the transition is m'' = -m'.

So for the second transition, the only allowed dipole component is m'' = -m'.

Therefore, for each m', the second transition can only use the dipole component m'' = -m'.

So now, considering both transitions, each has a certain number of allowed paths.

But let me think about the probabilities.

Each transition's probability depends on the square of the matrix element. The matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) are for each m' (−1,0,+1). Similarly, the second transition (2→1) depends on m'.

But perhaps the probabilities are symmetric for m' = +1 and m' = -1, but different for m' = 0.

Because m' = 0 would correspond to a dipole component m''=0 for the second transition.

But I'm not too sure about the exact probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe the transition probabilities are the same for m' = +1 and m' = -1, and different for m' = 0.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible paths.

Wait, but the options only give specific paths. For example, options A, B, C, D suggest only one intermediate state is taken.

So perhaps the correct path is via m'=0, because that's the only one that leads to the final state with m=0.

Wait, no, the other m' values can also lead to m=0 in the second transition.

Wait, but let's think for each intermediate state m':

1. Intermediate state m' = 0:

Second transition from m'=0 → m_final=0.

In this case, the dipole component m'' must be 0.

So the second transition's matrix element would be proportional to the integral involving Y_1^0 * Y_1^0.

2. Intermediate state m' = +1:

Second transition from m'=+1 → m_final=0.

So the dipole component m'' must be -1.

3. Intermediate state m' = -1:

Second transition from m'=-1 → m_final=0.

Dipole component m'' must be +1.

So each of the three m' states is possible, but the matrix elements would have different strengths.

I remember that in hydrogen, the transition probabilities are higher for m=0 because of the orientation symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dipole matrix element for the first transition (3→2) is the same for m' = +1 and m' = -1, and different for m' =0.

Wait, the matrix element for the first transition depends on the overlap between the initial state (3s) and the final state (2p), which has m' = -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^m'.

But Y_0^0 is 1, and Y_1^m' are the spherical harmonics. The integral ∫ Y_1^m' Y_0^0 dΩ = ∫ Y_1^m' dΩ, which is zero unless m'=0, because Y_1^m' is zero-averaged except when m'=0.

Wait, wait no: Y_1^m' is the spherical harmonic for l=1. The integral ∫ Y_1^m' dΩ is zero except when m'=0, because for m' ≠0, the function isn't spherically symmetric.

Wait, but the integral of Y_1^m' over all angles is zero except when m'=0.

Wait, no, because Y_1^m' is a function with angular dependence. The integral of Y_1^m' over the sphere is zero except when m' =0, because for m'≠0, the function varies with angle.

So for the first transition, the matrix element for m' =0 is non-zero, but for m' = ±1, the matrix element is zero?

Wait that can't be right, because that would imply only the m'=0 transition is allowed, but I thought that dipole transitions can have m changes of 0 or ±1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (Y_0^0).

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m''.

So the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_2^m' * (Y_1^m'') * Y_0^0.

Wait, no, the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m' | r Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ⟨2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩, because the radial part would contribute a factor depending on n and l, but for our purposes, perhaps we can ignore the radial part for this argument.

So, ⟨2,1,m' | Y_1^m'' |3,0,0⟩.

But |3,0,0⟩ is Y_0^0.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2}^{m'}* Y_{1}^{m''} Y_{0}^0 dΩ.

This integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Remember that the product Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 = Y_1^{m''}.

Then, when you multiply by Y_2^{m'}, the integral is non-zero only if m' = m'' and l=2 (from Y_2^m') is obtained from the product of Y_0^0 and Y_1^{m''}.

Wait, but the integral ∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 dΩ is zero unless the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. The product Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} has l=1, m=m''.

Then integrating with Y_2^{m'} would require that 1 and 0 combine to give 2. But 0 (from Y_0^0) and 1 can only add up to 1 or 0, not 2. So, the integral must be zero.

Wait, that can't be right because dipole transitions do happen. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the selection.

Wait, maybe the correct selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, which is satisfied here (0→1). So how does that fit in?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the matrix element wrong. Let me think of it in terms of angular momentum coupling.

The matrix element involves the product Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0. This is Y_1^{m''}.

So when you multiply by Y_2^{m'}, the integral is ∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only if m' = m'' and 2 = 1 + 1, which isn't possible because 1+1=2, so yes, l=2 is allowed.

Wait, because 1 (from dipole) and 0 (from initial state) can combine to 1, but how do they combine to 2?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The initial state is l=0, so when you multiply Y_0^0 and Y_1^{m''}, you get Y_1^{m''}.

Then the integral is of Y_2^{m'} times Y_1^{m''}.

For this integral to be non-zero, the product Y_1^{m''} must have a component with l=2. But that's only possible if m' = m'' and l=2, but wait, the product of Y_1^m'' and Y_2^{m'} would require that 1 and 2 can combine to give a term with l= something. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the matrix element for dipole transitions between states with l=0 and l'=1 is non-zero only when the dipole component's m'' equals the intermediate state's m'.

Wait, maybe the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Because the initial state is m=0, so m'' can be -1, 0, +1. So the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Which means the first transition can go to |2,1,-1⟩ via m''=-1, |2,1,0⟩ via m''=0, and |2,1,1⟩ via m''=+1.

So three possible intermediates.

But if the first transition's matrix element is non-zero for each of these three m', then the second transition must also be considered.

For each m' = -1, 0, +1:

Second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

In the second transition, the matrix element is proportional to ⟨1,0,0| Y_1^m'' |2,1,m'⟩.

Again, the dipole operator has m'' = -1, 0, +1.

The integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' Y_1^{m'} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only if m'' = -m' (because 0 = m' + m'' → m'' = -m').

So for each m', the dipole component in the second transition must have m'' = -m'.

So for m'=0, m''=0.

For m'=+1, m''=-1.

For m'=-1, m''=+1.

So each of these transitions is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions.

But the probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements.

The matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) and the second (2→1) each have different magnitudes.

I think for hydrogen, the matrix elements are proportional to certain factors, such as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=1, m'⟩ = |l=2, m''⟩ × |l=1, m_1⟩.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(1, m') (2, 0) (1, m'').

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the integral of Y_2^m' Y_1^m'' Y_0^0.

Which relates to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the product Y_1^m'' Y_0^0 = Y_1^m''.

The integral of Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} is non-zero only if m' = m'' and 2 = 1 + 1? I don't think that's right, because 1 and 0 combine to give 1, not 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the product of the spherical harmonics.

The electric dipole matrix element ⟨n', l', m'| r |n, l, m⟩ is proportional to √( (l (l+1) - l' (l' +1) + 1 )/( 2 (2l +1)(2l' +1) )) ) × something with m.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of possible paths.

Each of the three intermediates (m' = -1, 0, +1) contributes to the total probability. The probabilities for each are not the same because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients differ.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities for m'=0 is higher than for m'=±1.

Wait, I'm recalling that the transition probability for the 3s → 2p state is higher for m'=0, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is zero for m'=±1 because of some symmetry.

Wait, no, that can't be because hydrogen emits photons in all directions, but the matrix elements might be zero for certain m' due to symmetry.

Wait, maybe the integral for m'=±1 is zero. Let me think again.

The initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0). The dipole operator has components in the x, y, and z directions. The first transition can only change m by ±1 or 0.

But the matrix element for m'=±1 might be zero because the integral ∫ Y_2^{±1} Y_1^{±1} Y_0^0 dΩ is zero.

Wait, because for the first transition, the initial state is Y_0^0, and the dipole operator is Y_1^m. So the product is Y_1^m.

The final state is Y_2^{m'}, so the integral is of Y_2^{m'} Y_1^m.

Which is non-zero only if m' = m and l=2 is formed from combining l=1 and l=0.

Wait, but l=0 and l=1 can only combine to l=1, not l=2. So the integral would be zero for l'=2 and l=1 → l' can't be 2.

Wait, that can't be right because the transition does happen. Oh, wait, the dipole operator has l=1. The initial state is l=0, so the product is Y_1^m. Then, the final state is l'=1, so the integral of Y_1^{m'} Y_1^m dΩ would be non-zero only if m'=m and 1=1.

Wait, but the initial state transition is from l=0 to l=1, so l'=1. So the product Y_0^0 Y_1^m = Y_1^m.

The final state is Y_1^{m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^m dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m.

So that means the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m'=m''.

So for each dipole component m'' (−1,0,+1), the transition is allowed to m'=m''.

So the first transition can go to m'=−1, 0, +1.

Each of these has a certain probability.

But in the integral for the first transition's matrix element, Y_1^m'' is integrated with Y_1^{m'}.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the matrix element is non-zero, and the second transition can proceed.

Now, for the second transition, from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

As discussed earlier, the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = −m'.

So each of the three intermediates contributes.

But what is the relative strength of these matrix elements?

The probability for each path is proportional to the square of the matrix elements for each step.

So perhaps the first transition's matrix element depends on m' as follows:

The matrix element for the 3→2 transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for m'=m''.

Similarly, the second transition's matrix element is proportional to another Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities are symmetric for m'=±1, and m'=0 has a different value.

I think that the transition to m'=0 is more probable than the others because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=0 are larger.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of known transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the allowed transitions for 3s →2p are to p states with m=-1,0,+1.

But when considering the transition from 2p to 1s, each of these m' states can transition to 1s (m=0) as long as the dipole component m'' is −m'.

So, each of the three paths is possible.

The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

If each path has the same probability, the total would be 3*(probability of each).

But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the same for m'=0 and different for m'= ±1.

Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 transition is allowed for the first step, but that can't be right because the dipole operator can cause m changes of 0, ±1.

Wait, maybe the first transition's matrix element is zero for m' =±1.

Because the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), and the dipole operator is l=1. The product Y_0^0 Y_1^m'' is Y_1^m''.

The final state after first transition is Y_1^{m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m''} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m''.

But for the 3→2 transition, the final state is l'=1. So the integral is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So for each dipole component (m''=−1,0,+1), m' must equal m''.

Thus, the first transition can go to m' = −1, 0, +1.

But now, the integral of Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m''} is non-zero only when m' = m''.

So the first transition is allowed for all three m' values.

But the question is about what's the probability of each path.

Now, the probabilities would be determined by the square of the matrix elements for each step.

In the first transition, the matrix element for m' =0 would be larger than for m'=±1 because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 is larger.

Similarly, for the second transition, the matrix element would be different for m'=0, +1, -1.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the dominant contribution comes from m'=0.

So the first transition is more probable for m'=0, and the second transition would have a certain probability.

So let's estimate: the first transition's probability for m'=0 is higher.

Then, the second transition from m'=0 to m=0 would have a certain probability.

But the options suggest specific paths.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: same as A, but probability 2/3.

If the first transition has three possible paths, each with certain probabilities, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the squares of their amplitudes.

Assume that the first transition to m'=0 has a higher probability than the others.

Let me think about the possible Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 (intermediate state).

The coefficient C(l=1, m') = C(1, m') (1,0) (1, m'').

Wait, no, perhaps better to think of the transition in terms of the Wigner 3-j symbols.

But I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps the transition probabilities are proportional to the squares of the matrix elements.

The matrix element for the first transition is proportional to ⟨2,1,m'| r |3,0,0⟩.

Which would involve the integral of Y_2^{m'} * Y_1^{m''} * Y_0^0.

As earlier, this is non-zero only when m' = m''.

Therefore, for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only when m'' = m'.

Wait, but Y_1^{m''} is part of the dipole operator.

Hmm.

Another idea: the transition probability from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is proportional to (2l_i +1)(2l_f +1) δ_{l_i,l_f ±1} δ_{m_i, m_f ±1}.

Wait, no, that's more about the selection rules than the probability.

Alternatively, the electric dipole transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the overlap integral.

Perhaps the transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 (intermediate state) is:

C(1, m') (1, 0) (1, m'') = √( (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ) ... ?

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=1, m'⟩ = |l=1, m''⟩ × |l=0, 0⟩ is:

C(1, m') (1, 0) (1, m'') = √( ( (1 +1)! ) / ( (1 -1 +1)! (1 +1 -1 +1)! )) )) × something.

Wait, the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is:

C(j, m) (j1, m1) (j2, m2) = √( ( (2j+1) (j1 + j2 - j)! ) / ( (j1 - j + j2 + j)! (j1 + j2 + j)! ) ) )) × (-1)^{j1 - j2 + j} ... ?

I'm getting stuck here, perhaps it's better to think of specific cases.

For m' =0: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,0⟩ from |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩ is 1.

For m' =1: The coefficient is √( ( (1+1) ) / (2) ) ) × something.

Wait, perhaps for m'=0, the coefficient is 1.

For m'=1, it's √( ( (1+1) ) / (1+1+1) ) ) ? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,1⟩ from |1,1⟩ and |0,0⟩ is 1.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the matrix elements are largest for m'=0, and smaller for m'=±1.

Assuming that the matrix elements for the first transition (3→2) are largest for m'=0, and smaller for others.

Similarly, for the second transition from m'=0, the matrix element is larger than for m'=±1.

So the path through m'=0 would contribute more to the total probability.

But without exact numbers, perhaps the probabilities are of the order 1/3 each for the three paths, summing to 1.

But the options only give specific paths.

Looking at the options, option A and D have the same path (m'=0), but different probabilities.

Option A: probability 1/3.

Option D: probability 2/3.

So if the total probability is the sum of the three paths, each with 1/3, then the correct path is A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 path is allowed, giving a probability of 1.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps only the m'=0 transition is allowed in the first step, but that can't be because the dipole operator allows m=±1.

Alternatively, maybe the probability for the m'=0 path is higher, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the possible transitions in hydrogen.

In hydrogen, the 3s → 2p transitions are allowed, and then 2p → 1s transitions are allowed.

The 3s → 1s transition would require two steps: 3s → 2p → 1s.

In the first step, 3s → 2p, which can go to 2p_{-1}, 2p_0, 2p_+1.

Then, each of these can transition to 1s.

In the second step, 2p_{m'} → 1s: m' must change by ±1 or 0 to reach m=0.

So, for each m' in 2p, there's a transition.

The probabilities are determined by the square of the matrix elements.

In hydrogen, the 3s → 2p transition has the highest probability for m'=0, because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is largest there.

Similarly, the 2p →1s transition would have highest probability when m'=0.

So the total probability would be the sum for each m' of |M1|^2 * |M2|^2.

Assuming M1 is largest for m'=0, and M2 is largest for m'=0, the dominant contribution would come from m'=0.

So the transition via m'=0 would have the highest probability.

So the correct path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Looking at the options, that's option A and D.

But what's the probability in option A: 1/3; option D: 2/3.

So which one is it?

If the first transition's probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is 1 for m'=0, and other values for m' = ±1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (initial state) to get l'=1 and m'=0 is 1.

Similarly, for m'=±1, the coefficients are √( ( (1 +0 +1) ) )? Maybe not.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition (3→2) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(1, m') (1, m''=m') (0,0).

Which for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 is sqrt( ( (1)(1+1) ) / ( (1 +1) ) )) → sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2.

So the matrix element for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=±1 is 1/√2.

Thus, the square of the matrix elements for the first transition are:

m'=0: 1² = 1.

m'=±1: (1/√2)² = 1/2.

So the first transition's probabilities for each m' are:

m'=0: 1/(1 + 1/2 + 1/2) )= 1/ (2) → probability is 1/2.

m'=±1: 1/2 each → each has probability 1/4.

So the first transition has m'=0 with probability 1/2, and m'=±1 each with 1/4.

Now, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element for the second transition also depends on m'.

Assuming that the second transition's matrix element is largest when m'=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the second transition is C(0,0) (1,m') (1, m''=-m').

Wait, the second transition's matrix element is proportional to C(0,0) (1, m') (1, m''= -m').

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 (m') and l=1 (m''= -m') to get l=0 and m=0.

The coefficient is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^{m'} [ ( (1 - m') (1 + m') ) / (2 (2m')^2 ) ) ]^(1/2) ?

Alternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l=0, m=0 from l=1, m' and l=1, m''= -m' is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^{m'} sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| ) (1 + |m'| ) ) / (2 (2)^2) )) ).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling two states with l1=1, m1 = m' and l2=1, m2 = -m' to get l=0, m=0 is:

C(0,0) (1, m') (1, -m') = (-1)^m' sqrt( ( (1 - |m'| ) (1 + |m'| )) / (2 (2)^2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute for each possible m':

For m'=0:

C(0,0) (1,0) (1,0) = 1.

Because combining two l=1, m=0 states to get l=0, m=0 is allowed.

For m'=+1:

C(0,0) (1,1) (1,-1) = sqrt( ( (1)(2) ) / (2 (2)^2) )) ) * (-1)^1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the coefficient for l=0, m=0 from two l=1 states with m=+1 and m=-1 is sqrt( ( (1)(2) ) / (2*(2)^2) )) ) * (-1)^{1}.

Wait, I think the correct value is sqrt( (1 * (1 + 1 +1 )) )) / something, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for |0,0⟩ from |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ is sqrt(2/3) * (-1)^1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for two p orbitals combining to form s (l=0) and d (l=2):

The s state (l=0) from p and p: the coefficients are known.

The combination for |1,1⟩ and |1,-1⟩ gives |0,0⟩ with CG coefficient sqrt( (1 * 2)/( (1 +1 +1) )) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the matrix elements for the dipole transitions.

The electric dipole transition from 3s to 2p.

The matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_1^m'' Y_0^0 Y_2^{m'}.

Which for m''=m' is non-zero.

So the transition probabilities are proportional to |∫ Y_2^{m'} Y_1^{m''} Y_0^0 dΩ |^2.

Which is largest for m'=0 because Y_2^0 is the largest.

Therefore, the first transition's probability is highest for m'=0.

Similarly, for the second transition, the matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^{m''} Y_1^{m'}.

Which is non-zero only when m'' = -m'.

The integral is largest when m'=0.

So the second transition's probability is highest when m'=0.

Thus, the path through m'=0 has the largest contribution, but the other paths also contribute.

Now, the total probability P is:

P = sum_{m'} [ |M1(m')|^2 * |M2(m')|^2 ]

Assuming that M1(m') is the first transition's matrix element for m', and M2(m') is the second transition's matrix element for m'.

From earlier, M1(m') for the first transition has |M1(0)|^2 = 1, |M1(±1)|^2 = 1/2.

For the second transition, M2(m'):

For m'=0, |M2(0)|^2 is maximum, perhaps 1.

For m'=±1, |M2(±1)|^2 might be smaller.

But without exact values, perhaps the dominant term is the m'=0 path, contributing 1 * 1 = 1.

But that can't be because the other paths contribute as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for the second transition are the same for all m'.

Thus, the total probability would be:

(1/2 * a^2) + (1/4 * b^2) + (1/4 * c^2)

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the 3s → 2p transition has a certain probability distribution, and then the 2p →1s transition has another.

The total probability for the entire process is the sum over all possible intermediate states.

But I remember that in the case of the 3s → 2p →1s transition, the probability is higher for certain paths.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each dipole transition is 1/3, but in reality, the probabilities are more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think about it is that in the first transition, the probability is 1/2 for m'=0, and 1/4 each for m'=±1. Then, in the second transition, each m' has a certain probability.

Assuming that for the second transition, each m' has a 1/3 chance, the total would be:

(1/2 * 1/3) + (1/4 *1/3) + (1/4 *1/3) = (1/6 + 1/12 +1/12 )= (2/12 + 1/12 +1/12 )= 4/12= 1/3.

So the total probability would be 1/3.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A: probability 1/3.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in hydrogen to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The process occurs in two steps: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must satisfy the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and First Transition**:
   - The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0). 
   - The first transition must go to a state with l=1 (p orbital) because Δl = ±1. Thus, the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

2. **Second Transition**:
   - The second transition must go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. This requires Δl = -1 (from l=1 to l=0) and Δm = -m (since the final state has m=0).

3. **Selection of Intermediate State**:
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ can have m = -1, 0, or +1. Each of these states contributes to the total probability of the decay process.
   - The probability of each path depends on the square of the matrix elements for the two transitions. The matrix elements are proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers.

4. **Probability Contributions**:
   - The first transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩) has different probabilities for m = -1, 0, +1. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are largest for m=0, making this path more probable.
   - The second transition (|2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) also depends on m. The probability is largest for m=0 because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=±1 are smaller.

5. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the sum of the contributions from all possible intermediate states. The dominant contribution comes from the path through m=0, as it has the largest matrix elements for both transitions.
   - The total probability for the decay is proportional to the contributions from all three intermediate states. After accounting for the relative probabilities, the total probability is found to be **1/3**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the probability for m=+1 is smaller than for m=0.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for similar reasons as Option B.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.

**Answer: A**
