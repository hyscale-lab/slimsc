Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

Alright, the question describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to molecular shapes and their symmetries, which are determined by how the molecule looks and how it can be rotated or reflected without changing its appearance.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm not sure what A and B are, but 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. Common reactions with equivalents like that might involve metals reacting with gases like O2 or Cl2, but I'm not certain yet.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4 or HCl, and weak ones like CH3COOH or HCN. Hmm, when a compound reacts with water to form a metal (maybe) and two acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide or something similar. Wait, if C reacts with water to give A and two acids, maybe C is something like a metal carbonate or maybe a more complex oxide.

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like water (H2O), alcohol (like ethanol, but that's more complex), or maybe something else. But B and D reacting 1:1... maybe B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O? Or perhaps something else. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, let me consider the possibilities for each step.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, suppose A is copper (Cu) and B is chlorine (Cl2). 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Cu is a solid metal, Cl2 is a gas. But when Cu reacts with Cl2, it forms CuCl2. But wait, is that right? Let me think: Copper and chlorine react to form CuCl2, but under certain conditions, maybe with excess Cl2, it forms CuCl2 (which is blue) or maybe CuCl (if less Cl2, but I'm not sure. But the product is bright red. Oh, wait, maybe it's not copper. Some other metal.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. Iron reacts with chlorine to form FeCl3. But FeCl3 is yellowish-brown, not red. Hmm. What about something else. Bright red product... maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with sulfur. But sulfur is a solid, but the product is red. Maybe A is an oxide reacting with something else. Alternatively, let's think about another possibility.

Wait, the product C reacts with water to form A and two acids. So, if C is a salt, perhaps a metal sulfate or something else. But then, to form two acids... maybe it's a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. When C reacts with water, it produces A (which is a solid) and F and G. So, suppose C is something like a metal oxide (but which oxide would produce two different acids on hydrolysis? Maybe it's a mixed oxide or a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonate. Wait, carbonates react with water to form the metal hydroxide and carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. But that would give one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride? If C is a nitride, then reacting with water would give the metal and ammonia (NH3, which is a weak base, but perhaps the reaction could produce other products. Not sure if that aligns with producing two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Sulfides can react with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, maybe that's not two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a more complex salt. Let me think: Perhaps it's a double oxide. For example, suppose C is something like Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (a strong base, but wait, the question says two acids. So that wouldn't fit, since it forms a base. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. Let's say, for example, if C is AlCl3. Then, when it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Al(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid, and if another acid is formed perhaps from another reaction. Wait, but that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction of C with water produces a metal and two oxyacids. For example, if C is a metal carbonate, say CaCO3, then reacting with water wouldn't change much, but perhaps if it's a more complex salt.

Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Nitrate salts typically hydrolyze only slightly, but maybe if it's a more complex structure. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the second reaction: C + 2 D → E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is a gas, like O2, and C is a metal oxide, then E could be a different oxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is chlorine gas, but then C would react with Cl2 in some way. Hmm.

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, methanol, etc. So if B and D are elements that combine 1:1 to form a solvent, perhaps B is O, D is H. Wait, but O2 and H2 would combine to form H2O. So maybe D is H2 and B is O2. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So if that's the case, then B is O2 and D is H2. Then, let's see:

In the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a solid metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. 8 equivalents mean the ratio between A and O2 is 1:8. So for a metal M, the reaction would be 4 M(s) + 8 O2(g) → 2 M4O8(s) or something. Wait, maybe the formula is MO2. Let me check. If the reaction is A + 8 B → C, and B is O2, then the formula of C would be A O8? Wait, but that's not a typical formula.

Wait, perhaps it's a metal reacting with O2 to form a particular oxide. Let me think about the reaction: 4 Cu(s) + 8 O2 → 2 CuO2(s) → but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the oxide is CuO, but then the stoichiometry wouldn't be 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is 2 Fe(s) + 8 O2 → 2 FeO2? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe, but the oxide would be Fe3O4, which has the formula FeO·Fe2O3, so it's a mixture. But the reaction with O2 would likely form Fe3O4, but the stoichiometry might not be 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. But sulfur is a solid, and SO2 is a gas, but the product C is a solid. So maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is with another oxide. Wait, maybe A is magnesium, and B is O2. Magnesium burns in O2 to form MgO. But the stoichiometry is Mg + O2 → MgO. The ratio would be 1:1. But in the reaction, it's 8 equivalents, so perhaps the oxide has a higher O content.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with O2 when burned to form Al2O3. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So the ratio is 4 Al :3 O2 → 8 equivalents would mean 8 O2 per Al. Wait, but 3 O2 per 4 Al, so per mole of Al, (3/4) moles of O2. But the reaction here is 1 mole A +8 moles B → C, so the ratio is 1:8. So for Al, that wouldn't fit, because it's 4:3.

Hmm, so perhaps A is a metal with a higher valence, so that the stoichiometry works out to 1:8. Let's see: if A is a metal with a +4 oxidation state, then the oxide would be MO2. The reaction would be A(s) + 2 O2(g) → MO2(s). So the ratio is 1:2, but the question says 8 equivalents, so maybe it's MO2, but with 8 O2 per A? That doesn't make sense because MO2 only needs 2 O2 per A.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product C is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). The reaction for Na2O2 is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So the ratio is 2 Na : 1 O2 → 2:1. But in the question, the ratio is 1:8, so this doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with formula MO4. So the reaction would be A + 2 O2 → MO4. So 1:2 ratio. But the question is 1:8, so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe B isn't O2. Let me think of other gases. Maybe B is Cl2. Then D would need to react with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmmm, what reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe H2 and Cl2 form HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps it's another reaction. Wait, D and B (Cl2) react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So if B is Cl2, what D would 1:1 with Cl2 form a solvent? Maybe HClO, but that's not a common solvent. Or perhaps Cl2 + something else forms a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, as I thought earlier. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So going back, if B is O2, D is H2, then H is H2O.

So, the first reaction is A reacting with O2 (8 equivalents) to form C. So the ratio is 1 A : 8 O2 → product C.

Looking for a metal that reacts with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let me think of possible metals and their oxides.

Wait, perhaps the oxide is FeO. The reaction for FeO is 2 Fe + O2 → 2 FeO. So 2 Fe :1 O2 → ratio of 2:1. But in the question, it's 1:8, so that's much higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a higher oxide, like FeO4? Not sure if that exists.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the product C is PbO2. Lead(IV) oxide. The reaction for PbO2 is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So the ratio is 2 Pb :3 O2 → 2:3. Again, not matching 1:8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me consider product E. What's E? It's formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. If D is H2, then reaction is C + 2 H2 → E.

If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with H2 would form the metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → Fe + 4 H2O. But that would give Fe and H2O, but E is a product that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 under certain conditions to form something else.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal hydride. For example, perhaps C is CuO, and H2 reacts with it to form Cu and H2O. But then E would be H2O, which isn't extremely hazardous, though. Alternatively, maybe C is a higher oxide like PbO2. Reacting with H2 might produce something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, when it reacts with H2, perhaps it forms NaOH and O2? Not sure about that reaction.

Wait, but the question says that when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids F and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if A is a metal, and F and G are acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide that can hydrolyze into a metal and two different acids. That would imply that the oxide is a more complex structure, perhaps a carbonate or another compound.

Wait, carbonate: if C is a metal carbonate, say CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with water, wouldn't it just stay as CaCO3, unless it's heated or something? Or perhaps it's a different carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, suppose C is Al(NO3)3. Reacting with water would not produce acids, but maybe if it's a hydrated nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4. When it reacts with water, it just forms CuSO4·5H2O. Not sure if that gives acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. But again, reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a basic carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O. When it reacts with water, it might produce NaOH and CO2, but that's only one acid (CO2 is a weak acid, H2CO3). But the question says two different acids, so maybe C is a more complex salt.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide, like FeO·Fe2O3, which is magnetite. When it reacts with water, it might not change much, but I don't think that would produce two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about what E is. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas or a volatile compound. When C reacts with H2 (if D is H2), perhaps E is something like HCN or H2S, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider what E could be. If C is a metal oxide and D is H2, then E could be the metal. But the metal would be a solid, not extremely hazardous. Unless it's a metal that's highly toxic, like mercury or lead. But mercury is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas produced in the reaction, but I'm not quite getting there.

Wait, maybe D isn't H2. Let's think again about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Another possibility is if B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, Cl2 + CH4 under certain conditions (like light) would produce CH3Cl (which is a solvent, but I'm not sure). Or perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is NH3. Then O2 and NH3 in a 1:1 ratio might form something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. CH4 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio might not react under normal conditions, but perhaps under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O, but that's not a reaction I can think of.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H2 + O2 → H2O, which is a solvent. So in that case, D is O2, B is H2. Wait, no, because the reaction is D + B in 1:1 ratio. So if H is H2O, then D and B could be H2 and O2, but then the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, but the question says 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe D is O3 (ozone) and B is O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between O2 and another diatomic gas.

Alternatively, perhaps B is F2 and D is something else. Hmm, but I'm not making progress there. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product E's molecular symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all molecular point groups. So knowing E's structure would help.

D∞h symmetry is high, like in a linear molecule with multiple identical atoms, like O2, N2, CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h), wait no, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, H2O has C2v symmetry. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry as well. Another possibility is that E is a molecule with a certain geometry.

Wait, so looking at the options:

A) C2: a two-fold rotation axis, perhaps a bent molecule like H2O or NH3.

B) D4h: a high symmetry group, perhaps a square planar or linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry.

C) D∞h: infinite symmetry along an axis, like O2 (linear molecule) or CO2.

D) C2v: a two-fold rotation plus a vertical mirror plane, which would fit a bent molecule with a center of inversion. Ozone has this.

Hmm, so if E has D4h symmetry, it might be a planar molecule with four-fold symmetry, like some transition metal complexes. But I'm not sure how that would tie into the reactions.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But would that fit with the reaction?

But earlier, B is O2? Let's think again. If B is O2, then reaction 1 is A + 8 O2 → C. Suppose A is a metal, perhaps Fe. If Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO2 (though I'm not sure if that's a real compound), but the stoichiometry is 1 Fe : 8 O2, which would imply FeO8. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is carbon. Carbon (solid) reacting with O2 to form CO or CO2. But carbon as a solid, like graphite or diamond, reacting with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let me see: 2 C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2. So the ratio is 2:3, which is not 1:8. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of CO. 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. Again, ratio 2:1. Still not matching 1:8.

Wait, perhaps A is another element. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D in 2 equivalents to form E, and E is extremely hazardous. If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's something like HCN or SO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl. For example, if C is a metal oxide, and D is CO, then the reaction could produce a metal carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should instead think about the structure of E based on the symmetry groups. Let's say E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps it's something like H2O, which has C2v symmetry as well. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h.

But earlier, I'm not entirely sure about the reactions, so maybe considering the symmetry groups can help.

Wait, another idea: If E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But that would mean in reaction 2, C reacts with H2 (if D is H2) to form O2. That doesn't make much sense, as that would imply a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps E is a different diatomic molecule.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But how would that fit into the reactions?

Wait, perhaps product E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. Like O2. So if E is O2, the symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But then, how does that fit the reactions?

Wait, that would require that C reacts with D (H2) to form O2, which doesn't make much sense. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has D∞h symmetry? No, wait, SO2 has a bent structure and the point group is D2h or C2v. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck and should think of another approach. Let me try to outline what I know:

1. A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(solid, bright red)
2. C + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A(s) + F(acid) + G(acid)
   - F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

4. D(g) + B(g) in 1:1 → H(solvent)

From point 4, H is a solvent formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio.

Assuming H is H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2, respectively, because H2O is formed from 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the stoichiometry for H is 1:1, so perhaps the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O. But in reality, it's 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that would be a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which doesn't match the 1:1 given. So maybe H isn't H2O.

Wait, another solvent: maybe H is NH3 (ammonia). Then, D and B would be N2 and H2, since N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that would be a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), formed from CO2 and H2. But that would require B to be CO2 and D to be H2. Then the reaction would be CO2 + 3 H2 → 2 CH3OH. That's a 1:3 ratio again. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe H is CS2 (carbon disulfide), but I'm not sure about its formation.

Alternatively, perhaps H is COCl2 (phosgene), but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something like CH4, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's CCl4, but that's a solvent. But how to form it? Maybe from C (solid) and Cl2, but the reaction would be C + 2 Cl2 → CCl4. That's a 1:2 ratio, but we need a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH2Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, perhaps H is another oxide. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O (but that's a liquid, not a gas), but that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with another approach.

Assuming that point 3 is C reacting with water to form A (a solid) and two acids. So, since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a nitride or a higher oxide that on hydrolysis produces a strong acid and another weak acid.

Wait, for example, suppose C is a nitride, like Na3N. Reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base, but perhaps the question considers it as an acid if it's in solution) and NH3 (weak base). But this doesn't fit because F and G are acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed carbonate and nitrate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like PbS. Reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But that would only give one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a carbonate, like NaHCO3. Reacting with water wouldn't change much, but perhaps if it's heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But I'm not sure if that would produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but I don't see how that would produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But that's a liquid, not a solid. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when it reacts with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is an anhydride of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, suppose C is Na2S2O7 (disodium disulfate dodecahydrate?), which on hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2S (weak acid). But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O3) reacts with water to produce H2SO3 (weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH (strong base, but perhaps not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is something like (NH4)HSO4, which is a acid and a base. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. Wait, but metal hydroxides are usually basic, not acidic. Unless it's something like Al(OH)3, which can act as an amphoteric hydroxide. But then, reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate. For example, calcium sulfate carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm going too deep into this without enough information. Let me think about the possible products and their symmetry.

If E's symmetry group is D4h (option B), that's a high symmetry group which includes a four-fold rotation axis and mirror planes. That's common in square planar or tetrahedral molecules. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry (option C), like O2 or CO2.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like H2O, it would have C2v symmetry (option D).

So, to figure out which option is correct, perhaps I should determine what E is. Given that E is formed when C reacts with D (which is H2 if earlier assumption holds) in a 2:1 ratio.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, and D is H2, then perhaps E is the metal. But if the metal is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's mercury or something. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas produced in the reaction. If C is a metal oxide and reacts with H2, maybe it's a redox reaction. For example, perhaps C is Fe3O4, which reacts with H2 to form Fe and H2O. But then E would be H2O, which is a solvent, not extremely hazardous.

Wait, perhaps E is a different compound. Let me think of another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a peroxide, like PbO2. PbO2 reacting with H2 might produce Pb and H2O. But again, E would be H2O, which isn't extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like AlN. Reacting with H2 might produce Al and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if the reaction produces something like NH3, that's a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is HCN. If C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxide. For example, suppose C is a manganate (MnO2). MnO2 reacts with H2 in acidic conditions to produce Mn^2+ and water. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with H2 produces a metal hydride. For example, LiO2 reacting with H2 to form Li2O and H2O. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the options for E's symmetry group.

If E has D4h symmetry, perhaps it's a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure but D2h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a square planar molecule like XeF4, but those are less common.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry (option D), which could fit.

Wait, let's think: if E is O3, then the symmetry is C2v. How would that fit into the reactions?

But earlier, I thought D is H2 and B is O2. So in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 H2 to form O3. That would be an unusual reaction, but perhaps in some conditions, O3 can be formed from O2 and H2. I'm not familiar with that reaction, though.

Alternatively, if E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 H2 → H2O. But that would mean C is O2, which doesn't fit because C is a solid produced from A and B (O2). Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a molecule like NO2, which is a red-brown gas. But NO2 has C2v symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is a gas but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure and belongs to the C2v point group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry, making option C correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to summarize:

- A reacts with 8 B to make C (bright red).
- C reacts with 2 D to make E (extremely hazardous).
- C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
- D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

Assuming B is O2 and D is H2, H is H2O (but that requires a 2:1 ratio, which doesn't match the 1:1 in the problem. So perhaps that's wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. Then, D + B → H, which is something like H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Then, D + B → HCl (which is a gas, not a solvent). No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: B is O3 and D is O2. Then, D + B → O2O3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is O3, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, I might be stuck here. Given that, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion based on the symmetry groups and the options.

If E is O2, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But I'm not sure if the reaction fits. Alternatively, if E is H2O, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D4h. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The reaction C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong and G is weak. For example, if C is a basic carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O, then reacting with water (H2O) might produce NaOH (strong base, but F and G are acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate that can hydrolyze into a strong acid and another acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). Reacting with water would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is weak acid, but that's not correct because NH4OH is a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, C could be a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But as I thought before, it's a liquid, not a solid. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of what E could be.

If E is a highly dangerous gas with a certain symmetry, perhaps it's a molecule like phosgene (COCl2), which has D2h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E is a metal carbonyl, like Ni(CO)4, which has a tetrahedral structure and Td symmetry. Not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should go with the initial assumption that E is O2, leading to D∞h symmetry (option C). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps E is another molecule.

Wait, another idea: maybe E is a linear molecule like CO, which has D∞h symmetry. CO is a toxic gas, which fits the description of E being extremely hazardous. So if E is CO, that's possible.

Then, how would that fit into the reactions? Let's see:

If E is CO, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → CO.

If D is H2, then C must be reacting with H2 to produce CO. That would require C to be something like FeO or another oxide. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, if D is another gas, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with D to form CO. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate that reacts with D to produce CO2 (which is E). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, and D is H2, then reaction would be CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But that doesn't produce CO, and CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). That would make sense.

So, putting this together:

- A is Ca (calcium), B is CO2 (but wait, earlier I thought B was O2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the wrong B.

Wait, let's adjust. If B is CO2, then reaction 1: A (Ca) + 8 CO2 → C (CaCO3) ? No, because CaCO3 is formed from CaO and CO2. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Ca + 8 CO2 → Ca(CO3)4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Then, Fe reacts with excess O2 to form FeO2 (not sure about that), but the product would be a bright red solid? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an oxide and B is another gas.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Based on the information, perhaps the correct answer is option C, D∞h, because E would be a linear molecule like CO2, O2, or CO, which have D∞h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (1:8) suggests a metal reacting with a diatomic gas like O₂ or Cl₂ to form an oxide or halide. However, the bright red color of C is a key clue. This could indicate a transition metal oxide, though the exact identity of A and C remains uncertain.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The nature of E depends on the identity of C and D. If D is H₂, E could be a gas or volatile compound. If D is another gas, E might be a toxic molecule like CO or SO₂.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C is likely a complex oxide or carbonate that hydrolyzes to produce acids. For example, if C is a carbonate, it could hydrolyze to form CO₂ (a weak acid) and a strong acid like H₂SO₄.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, H could be H₂O. However, the stoichiometry (1:1) does not match the typical 2:1 ratio for H₂O formation. This suggests B and D might be other gases forming a different solvent.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. The options are:
  - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, typical for bent molecules like H₂O or NH₃.
  - **D4h**: High symmetry, common in square planar or linear molecules with multiple planes of symmetry.
  - **D∞h**: Infinite symmetry along an axis, typical for linear molecules like O₂ or CO₂.
  - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, common for bent molecules like O₃.

- If E is a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, its symmetry group would be **D∞h**. If E is a bent molecule like O₃ or H₂O, its symmetry group would be **C2v**. However, the description of E as "extremely hazardous" aligns with a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, which have **D∞h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the symmetry options, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

Alright, the question describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to molecular shapes and their symmetries, which are determined by how the molecule looks and how it can be rotated or reflected without changing its appearance.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm not sure what A and B are, but 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. Common reactions with equivalents like that might involve metals reacting with gases like O2 or Cl2, but I'm not certain yet.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4 or HCl, and weak ones like CH3COOH or HCN. Hmm, when a compound reacts with water to form a metal (maybe) and two acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide or something similar. Wait, if C reacts with water to give A and two acids, maybe C is something like a metal carbonate or maybe a more complex oxide.

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like water (H2O), alcohol (like ethanol, but that's more complex), or maybe something else. But B and D reacting 1:1... maybe B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O? Or perhaps something else. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, let me consider the possibilities for each step.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, suppose A is copper (Cu) and B is chlorine (Cl2). 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Cu is a solid metal, Cl2 is a gas. But when Cu reacts with Cl2, it forms CuCl2. But wait, is that right? Let me think: Copper and chlorine react to form CuCl2, but under certain conditions, maybe with excess Cl2, it forms CuCl2 (which is blue) or maybe CuCl (if less Cl2, but I'm not sure. But the product is bright red. Oh, wait, maybe it's not copper. Some other metal.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. Iron reacts with chlorine to form FeCl3. But FeCl3 is yellowish-brown, not red. Hmm. What about something else. Bright red product... maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with sulfur. But sulfur is a solid, but the product is red. Maybe A is an oxide reacting with something else. Alternatively, let's think about another possibility.

Wait, the product C reacts with water to form A and two acids. So, if C is a salt, perhaps a metal sulfate or something else. But then, to form two acids... maybe it's a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. When C reacts with water, it produces A (which is a solid) and F and G. So, suppose C is something like a metal oxide (but which oxide would produce two different acids on hydrolysis? Maybe it's a mixed oxide or a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonate. Wait, carbonates react with water to form the metal hydroxide and carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. But that would give one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride? If C is a nitride, then reacting with water would give the metal and ammonia (NH3, which is a weak base, but perhaps the reaction could produce other products. Not sure if that aligns with producing two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Sulfides can react with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, maybe that's not two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a more complex salt. Let me think: Perhaps it's a double oxide. For example, suppose C is something like Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (a strong base, but wait, the question says two acids. So that wouldn't fit, since it forms a base. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. Let's say, for example, if C is AlCl3. Then, when it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Al(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid, and if another acid is formed perhaps from another reaction. Wait, but that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction of C with water produces a metal and two oxyacids. For example, if C is a metal carbonate, say CaCO3, then reacting with water wouldn't change much, but perhaps if it's a more complex salt.

Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Nitrate salts typically hydrolyze only slightly, but maybe if it's a more complex structure. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the second reaction: C + 2 D → E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is a gas, like O2, and C is a metal oxide, then E could be a different oxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is chlorine gas, but then C would react with Cl2 in some way. Hmm.

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, methanol, etc. So if B and D are elements that combine 1:1 to form a solvent, perhaps B is O, D is H. Wait, but O2 and H2 would combine to form H2O. So maybe D is H2 and B is O2. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So if that's the case, then B is O2 and D is H2. Then, let's see:

In the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a solid metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. 8 equivalents mean the ratio between A and O2 is 1:8. So for a metal M, the reaction would be 4 M(s) + 8 O2(g) → 2 M4O8(s) or something. Wait, maybe the formula is MO2. Let me check. If the reaction is A + 8 B → C, and B is O2, then the formula of C would be A O8? Wait, but that's not a typical formula.

Wait, perhaps it's a metal reacting with O2 to form a particular oxide. Let me think about the reaction: 4 Cu(s) + 8 O2 → 2 CuO2(s) → but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the oxide is CuO, but then the stoichiometry wouldn't be 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is 2 Fe(s) + 8 O2 → 2 FeO2? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe, but the oxide would be Fe3O4, which has the formula FeO·Fe2O3, so it's a mixture. But the reaction with O2 would likely form Fe3O4, but the stoichiometry might not be 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. But sulfur is a solid, and SO2 is a gas, but the product C is a solid. So maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is with another oxide. Wait, maybe A is magnesium, and B is O2. Magnesium burns in O2 to form MgO. But the stoichiometry is Mg + O2 → MgO. The ratio would be 1:1. But in the reaction, it's 8 equivalents, so perhaps the oxide has a higher O content.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with O2 when burned to form Al2O3. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So the ratio is 4 Al :3 O2 → 8 equivalents would mean 8 O2 per Al. Wait, but 3 O2 per 4 Al, so per mole of Al, (3/4) moles of O2. But the reaction here is 1 mole A +8 moles B → C, so the ratio is 1:8. So for Al, that wouldn't fit, because it's 4:3.

Hmm, so perhaps A is a metal with a higher valence, so that the stoichiometry works out to 1:8. Let's see: if A is a metal with a +4 oxidation state, then the oxide would be MO2. The reaction would be A(s) + 2 O2(g) → MO2(s). So the ratio is 1:2, but the question says 8 equivalents, so maybe it's MO2, but with 8 O2 per A? That doesn't make sense because MO2 only needs 2 O2 per A.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product C is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). The reaction for Na2O2 is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So the ratio is 2 Na : 1 O2 → 2:1. But in the question, the ratio is 1:8, so this doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with formula MO4. So the reaction would be A + 2 O2 → MO4. So 1:2 ratio. But the question is 1:8, so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe B isn't O2. Let me think of other gases. Maybe B is Cl2. Then D would need to react with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmmm, what reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe H2 and Cl2 form HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps it's another reaction. Wait, D and B (Cl2) react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So if B is Cl2, what D would 1:1 with Cl2 form a solvent? Maybe HClO, but that's not a common solvent. Or perhaps Cl2 + something else forms a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, as I thought earlier. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So going back, if B is O2, D is H2, then H is H2O.

So, the first reaction is A reacting with O2 (8 equivalents) to form C. So the ratio is 1 A : 8 O2 → product C.

Looking for a metal that reacts with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let me think of possible metals and their oxides.

Wait, perhaps the oxide is FeO. The reaction for FeO is 2 Fe + O2 → 2 FeO. So 2 Fe :1 O2 → ratio of 2:1. But in the question, it's 1:8, so that's much higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a higher oxide, like FeO4? Not sure if that exists.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the product C is PbO2. Lead(IV) oxide. The reaction for PbO2 is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So the ratio is 2 Pb :3 O2 → 2:3. Again, not matching 1:8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me consider product E. What's E? It's formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. If D is H2, then reaction is C + 2 H2 → E.

If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with H2 would form the metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → Fe + 4 H2O. But that would give Fe and H2O, but E is a product that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 under certain conditions to form something else.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal hydride. For example, perhaps C is CuO, and H2 reacts with it to form Cu and H2O. But then E would be H2O, which isn't extremely hazardous, though. Alternatively, maybe C is a higher oxide like PbO2. Reacting with H2 might produce something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, when it reacts with H2, perhaps it forms NaOH and O2? Not sure about that reaction.

Wait, but the question says that when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids F and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if A is a metal, and F and G are acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide that can hydrolyze into a metal and two different acids. That would imply that the oxide is a more complex structure, perhaps a carbonate or another compound.

Wait, carbonate: if C is a metal carbonate, say CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with water, wouldn't it just stay as CaCO3, unless it's heated or something? Or perhaps it's a different carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, suppose C is Al(NO3)3. Reacting with water would not produce acids, but maybe if it's a hydrated nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4. When it reacts with water, it just forms CuSO4·5H2O. Not sure if that gives acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. But again, reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a basic carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O. When it reacts with water, it might produce NaOH and CO2, but that's only one acid (CO2 is a weak acid, H2CO3). But the question says two different acids, so maybe C is a more complex salt.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide, like FeO·Fe2O3, which is magnetite. When it reacts with water, it might not change much, but I don't think that would produce two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about what E is. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas or a volatile compound. When C reacts with H2 (if D is H2), perhaps E is something like HCN or H2S, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider what E could be. If C is a metal oxide and D is H2, then E could be the metal. But the metal would be a solid, not extremely hazardous. Unless it's a metal that's highly toxic, like mercury or lead. But mercury is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas produced in the reaction, but I'm not quite getting there.

Wait, maybe D isn't H2. Let's think again about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Another possibility is if B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, Cl2 + CH4 under certain conditions (like light) would produce CH3Cl (which is a solvent, but I'm not sure). Or perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is NH3. Then O2 and NH3 in a 1:1 ratio might form something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. CH4 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio might not react under normal conditions, but perhaps under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O, but that's not a reaction I can think of.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H2 + O2 → H2O, which is a solvent. So in that case, D is O2, B is H2. Wait, no, because the reaction is D + B in 1:1 ratio. So if H is H2O, then D and B could be H2 and O2, but then the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, but the question says 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe D is O3 (ozone) and B is O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between O2 and another diatomic gas.

Alternatively, perhaps B is F2 and D is something else. Hmm, but I'm not making progress there. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product E's molecular symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all molecular point groups. So knowing E's structure would help.

D∞h symmetry is high, like in a linear molecule with multiple identical atoms, like O2, N2, CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h), wait no, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, H2O has C2v symmetry. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry as well. Another possibility is that E is a molecule with a certain geometry.

Wait, so looking at the options:

A) C2: a two-fold rotation axis, perhaps a bent molecule like H2O or NH3.

B) D4h: a high symmetry group, perhaps a square planar or linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry.

C) D∞h: infinite symmetry along an axis, like O2 (linear molecule) or CO2.

D) C2v: a two-fold rotation plus a vertical mirror plane, which would fit a bent molecule with a center of inversion. Ozone has this.

Hmm, so if E has D4h symmetry, it might be a planar molecule with four-fold symmetry, like some transition metal complexes. But I'm not sure how that would tie into the reactions.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But would that fit with the reaction?

But earlier, B is O2? Let's think again. If B is O2, then reaction 1 is A + 8 O2 → C. Suppose A is a metal, perhaps Fe. If Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO2 (though I'm not sure if that's a real compound), but the stoichiometry is 1 Fe : 8 O2, which would imply FeO8. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is carbon. Carbon (solid) reacting with O2 to form CO or CO2. But carbon as a solid, like graphite or diamond, reacting with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let me see: 2 C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2. So the ratio is 2:3, which is not 1:8. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of CO. 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. Again, ratio 2:1. Still not matching 1:8.

Wait, perhaps A is another element. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D in 2 equivalents to form E, and E is extremely hazardous. If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's something like HCN or SO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl. For example, if C is a metal oxide, and D is CO, then the reaction could produce a metal carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should instead think about the structure of E based on the symmetry groups. Let's say E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps it's something like H2O, which has C2v symmetry as well. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h.

But earlier, I'm not entirely sure about the reactions, so maybe considering the symmetry groups can help.

Wait, another idea: If E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But that would mean in reaction 2, C reacts with H2 (if D is H2) to form O2. That doesn't make much sense, as that would imply a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps E is a different diatomic molecule.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But how would that fit into the reactions?

Wait, perhaps product E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. Like O2. So if E is O2, the symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But then, how does that fit the reactions?

Wait, that would require that C reacts with D (H2) to form O2, which doesn't make much sense. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has D∞h symmetry? No, wait, SO2 has a bent structure and the point group is D2h or C2v. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck and should think of another approach. Let me try to outline what I know:

1. A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(solid, bright red)
2. C + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A(s) + F(acid) + G(acid)
   - F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

4. D(g) + B(g) in 1:1 → H(solvent)

From point 4, H is a solvent formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio.

Assuming H is H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2, respectively, because H2O is formed from 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the stoichiometry for H is 1:1, so perhaps the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O. But in reality, it's 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that would be a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which doesn't match the 1:1 given. So maybe H isn't H2O.

Wait, another solvent: maybe H is NH3 (ammonia). Then, D and B would be N2 and H2, since N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that would be a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), formed from CO2 and H2. But that would require B to be CO2 and D to be H2. Then the reaction would be CO2 + 3 H2 → 2 CH3OH. That's a 1:3 ratio again. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe H is CS2 (carbon disulfide), but I'm not sure about its formation.

Alternatively, perhaps H is COCl2 (phosgene), but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something like CH4, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's CCl4, but that's a solvent. But how to form it? Maybe from C (solid) and Cl2, but the reaction would be C + 2 Cl2 → CCl4. That's a 1:2 ratio, but we need a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH2Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, perhaps H is another oxide. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O (but that's a liquid, not a gas), but that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with another approach.

Assuming that point 3 is C reacting with water to form A (a solid) and two acids. So, since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a nitride or a higher oxide that on hydrolysis produces a strong acid and another weak acid.

Wait, for example, suppose C is a nitride, like Na3N. Reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base, but perhaps the question considers it as an acid if it's in solution) and NH3 (weak base). But this doesn't fit because F and G are acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed carbonate and nitrate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like PbS. Reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But that would only give one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a carbonate, like NaHCO3. Reacting with water wouldn't change much, but perhaps if it's heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But I'm not sure if that would produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but I don't see how that would produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But that's a liquid, not a solid. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when it reacts with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is an anhydride of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, suppose C is Na2S2O7 (disodium disulfate dodecahydrate?), which on hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2S (weak acid). But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O3) reacts with water to produce H2SO3 (weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH (strong base, but perhaps not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is something like (NH4)HSO4, which is a acid and a base. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. Wait, but metal hydroxides are usually basic, not acidic. Unless it's something like Al(OH)3, which can act as an amphoteric hydroxide. But then, reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate. For example, calcium sulfate carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm going too deep into this without enough information. Let me think about the possible products and their symmetry.

If E's symmetry group is D4h (option B), that's a high symmetry group which includes a four-fold rotation axis and mirror planes. That's common in square planar or tetrahedral molecules. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry (option C), like O2 or CO2.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like H2O, it would have C2v symmetry (option D).

So, to figure out which option is correct, perhaps I should determine what E is. Given that E is formed when C reacts with D (which is H2 if earlier assumption holds) in a 2:1 ratio.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, and D is H2, then perhaps E is the metal. But if the metal is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's mercury or something. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas produced in the reaction. If C is a metal oxide and reacts with H2, maybe it's a redox reaction. For example, perhaps C is Fe3O4, which reacts with H2 to form Fe and H2O. But then E would be H2O, which is a solvent, not extremely hazardous.

Wait, perhaps E is a different compound. Let me think of another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a peroxide, like PbO2. PbO2 reacting with H2 might produce Pb and H2O. But again, E would be H2O, which isn't extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like AlN. Reacting with H2 might produce Al and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if the reaction produces something like NH3, that's a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is HCN. If C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxide. For example, suppose C is a manganate (MnO2). MnO2 reacts with H2 in acidic conditions to produce Mn^2+ and water. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with H2 produces a metal hydride. For example, LiO2 reacting with H2 to form Li2O and H2O. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the options for E's symmetry group.

If E has D4h symmetry, perhaps it's a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure but D2h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a square planar molecule like XeF4, but those are less common.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry (option D), which could fit.

Wait, let's think: if E is O3, then the symmetry is C2v. How would that fit into the reactions?

But earlier, I thought D is H2 and B is O2. So in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 H2 to form O3. That would be an unusual reaction, but perhaps in some conditions, O3 can be formed from O2 and H2. I'm not familiar with that reaction, though.

Alternatively, if E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 H2 → H2O. But that would mean C is O2, which doesn't fit because C is a solid produced from A and B (O2). Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a molecule like NO2, which is a red-brown gas. But NO2 has C2v symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is a gas but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure and belongs to the C2v point group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry, making option C correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to summarize:

- A reacts with 8 B to make C (bright red).
- C reacts with 2 D to make E (extremely hazardous).
- C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
- D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

Assuming B is O2 and D is H2, H is H2O (but that requires a 2:1 ratio, which doesn't match the 1:1 in the problem. So perhaps that's wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. Then, D + B → H, which is something like H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Then, D + B → HCl (which is a gas, not a solvent). No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: B is O3 and D is O2. Then, D + B → O2O3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is O3, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, I might be stuck here. Given that, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion based on the symmetry groups and the options.

If E is O2, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But I'm not sure if the reaction fits. Alternatively, if E is H2O, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D4h. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The reaction C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong and G is weak. For example, if C is a basic carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O, then reacting with water (H2O) might produce NaOH (strong base, but F and G are acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate that can hydrolyze into a strong acid and another acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). Reacting with water would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is weak acid, but that's not correct because NH4OH is a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, C could be a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But as I thought before, it's a liquid, not a solid. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of what E could be.

If E is a highly dangerous gas with a certain symmetry, perhaps it's a molecule like phosgene (COCl2), which has D2h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E is a metal carbonyl, like Ni(CO)4, which has a tetrahedral structure and Td symmetry. Not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should go with the initial assumption that E is O2, leading to D∞h symmetry (option C). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps E is another molecule.

Wait, another idea: maybe E is a linear molecule like CO, which has D∞h symmetry. CO is a toxic gas, which fits the description of E being extremely hazardous. So if E is CO, that's possible.

Then, how would that fit into the reactions? Let's see:

If E is CO, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → CO.

If D is H2, then C must be reacting with H2 to produce CO. That would require C to be something like FeO or another oxide. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, if D is another gas, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with D to form CO. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate that reacts with D to produce CO2 (which is E). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, and D is H2, then reaction would be CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But that doesn't produce CO, and CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). That would make sense.

So, putting this together:

- A is Ca (calcium), B is CO2 (but wait, earlier I thought B was O2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the wrong B.

Wait, let's adjust. If B is CO2, then reaction 1: A (Ca) + 8 CO2 → C (CaCO3) ? No, because CaCO3 is formed from CaO and CO2. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Ca + 8 CO2 → Ca(CO3)4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Then, Fe reacts with excess O2 to form FeO2 (not sure about that), but the product would be a bright red solid? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an oxide and B is another gas.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Based on the information, perhaps the correct answer is option C, D∞h, because E would be a linear molecule like CO2, O2, or CO, which have D∞h symmetry.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (1:8) suggests a metal reacting with a diatomic gas like O₂ or Cl₂ to form an oxide or halide. However, the bright red color of C is a key clue. This could indicate a transition metal oxide, though the exact identity of A and C remains uncertain.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The nature of E depends on the identity of C and D. If D is H₂, E could be a gas or volatile compound. If D is another gas, E might be a toxic molecule like CO or SO₂.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C is likely a complex oxide or carbonate that hydrolyzes to produce acids. For example, if C is a carbonate, it could hydrolyze to form CO₂ (a weak acid) and a strong acid like H₂SO₄.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, H could be H₂O. However, the stoichiometry (1:1) does not match the typical 2:1 ratio for H₂O formation. This suggests B and D might be other gases forming a different solvent.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. The options are:
  - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, typical for bent molecules like H₂O or NH₃.
  - **D4h**: High symmetry, common in square planar or linear molecules with multiple planes of symmetry.
  - **D∞h**: Infinite symmetry along an axis, typical for linear molecules like O₂ or CO₂.
  - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, common for bent molecules like O₃.

- If E is a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, its symmetry group would be **D∞h**. If E is a bent molecule like O₃ or H₂O, its symmetry group would be **C2v**. However, the description of E as "extremely hazardous" aligns with a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, which have **D∞h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the symmetry options, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂.
