Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation if they're moving at relativistic speeds. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So from the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer by a factor of gamma (γ), the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the question is about the resolution needed. I think resolution refers to the precision of the measurement, which in this case would be the minimum distance over which the decay can be observed. Because if the particles decay too far, they might leave a track that's too long, but if the chamber's resolution isn't good enough, it might not detect the decay accurately.

Wait, no. Maybe the minimum resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point. So if the decay length is too small, the detector can't resolve it. So the minimum resolution required would be such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for the mean decay length L is gamma * c * tau_0. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, and the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c for high-energy particles.

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/mc². Wait, E is the total energy, and for a relativistic particle, E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV for energy and mass. I think I can compute gamma as E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in GeV, and c is a constant, perhaps GeV units will cancel out. Let me think.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → but E is already given in units that include c², right? Because in particle physics, energy is often expressed as GeV, and mass as GeV/c². So when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², then E = gamma m c².

Wait, so E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But I'm not sure about the units. Let me think in terms of units:

E (GeV) = gamma * (m c²) → because m c² is in GeV (since m is GeV/c² multiplied by c² gives GeV).

So yes, gamma = E / (m c²). But since units-wise, E and m c^2 are both in GeV, gamma is just E / m.

Wait, because m c^2 is in GeV, and E is in GeV, so gamma would be E/(m c²) → which is (GeV) / (GeV) ) → unitless, which makes sense.

So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) → approximately 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me calculate: 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 *8 is about 27.28. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's take it as approximately 7.9.

So gamma is about 7.9.

Now, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0. So that's 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s → 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The decay length L is v * tau. Since v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L = v * tau ≈ c * tau.

So L = c * tau = c * gamma tau_0.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.32e-15 s → let me calculate that.

3e8 * 6.32e-15 = 3 * 6.32 * 1e-7 → 18.96e-7 meters → 1.896e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So maybe we're looking for the distance at which 30% of the particles have decayed. Because not all of them decay in the chamber.

The decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), but for a moving particle, it's 1 - exp(-L/(c*tau_0 * gamma))? Or wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

Wait, the decay probability P is 1 - exp(-t/tau), where t is the time the particle exists before decaying. But the distance it travels is L = v t. So alternatively, P = 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)).

Wait, but tau is gamma tau_0. So L/(v tau) = (L)/(gamma c tau_0). Since L = v t, and tau = gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the relation I should remember is that the probability a particle decays within a certain length is P = 1 - exp(-L/(c tau)).

Wait, no, considering that decay occurs over time, the probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), and t is the time the particle spends in the lab frame. But since L = v t ≈ c t, t = L/(c). So substituting, P = 1 - exp(- L/(c tau)).

Since tau = gamma tau_0, that becomes P = 1 - exp( - L/(c gamma tau_0) ).

We want P >= 0.3 (30%).

So 1 - exp(- L/(c gamma tau_0 )) = 0.3 → exp(-x) = 0.7, where x = L/(c gamma tau_0).

So x = ln(1/0.7) → ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So L = x * c gamma tau_0 = 0.3567 * c gamma tau_0.

We already have c=3e8 m/s, gamma ≈7.9, tau0=8e-16 s.

Calculate L:

0.3567 * 3e8 m/s * 7.9 *8e-16 s.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute the constants:

3e8 * 7.9 = 2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16 = 2.37e9 *8e-16 → 2.37 *8 is 18.96, and 1e9 *1e-16 = 1e-7.

So 18.96e-7 → 1.896e-6 meters.

Multiply by 0.3567:

0.3567 *1.896e-6 = let's see, approximately 0.3567 * 1.9e-6 ≈ 0.6777e-6 → 6.777e-7 meters, or 6.78e-7 m. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.3567 * 1.896 = ?

Let me compute 0.3567 * 1.896.

1.896 * 0.3 = 0.5688.

1.896 * 0.05 = 0.0948.

1.896 * 0.0067? Let's see, 1.896 * 0.006 is about 0.011376, and 0.0007 *1.896 is 0.0013272. So total is 0.0127032.

Adding them all: 0.5688 + 0.0948 = 0.6636 + 0.0127032 ≈ 0.6763032.

So 0.6763 *1e-6 meters → 6.763e-7 meters, approximately 6.76e-7 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of the options match 6.76e-7 m. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for L. Let me start over.

Another approach: The number of particles that decay is given by N = N0 (1 - exp(-t/tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime in the lab frame (tau = gamma tau0).

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay probability is lower.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the expected number of decays is 30%, so P = 0.3.

So, P = 1 - exp(- t/tau) = 0.3 → t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7)=0.3567.

But in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is tau = gamma tau0, so t = (gamma tau0) * 0.3567.

But the distance L = v t ≈ c t.

So L = c * gamma tau0 * 0.3567.

So substituting the numbers: c=3e8 m/s, gamma= ~7.9, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L = 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 * 0.3567.

Compute that:

3e8 =3 *1e8 =3e8.

7.9 ≈ 8.

8e-16 ≈8e-16.

So 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 0.3567: 2.4e-7 *0.3567 ≈8.56e-8 m.

Wait, that's 8.56e-8 meters, which is about 8.56e-8 m. Hmm, which is 0.856 nm. But none of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 *0.3567.

Let's compute each step numerically.

First, 3e8 *7.9 = 3 *7.9 *1e8 =23.7 *1e8 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16 = (2.37 *8) * 1e9 *1e-16 =18.96 *1e-7 =1.896e-6 m.

Then multiply by 0.3567: 1.896e-6 *0.3567 ≈ 6.76e-7 m → approximately 6.76e-7 meters, which is 0.676 micrometers or 676 nm.

But the options are all around 2.08e-6 m or similar.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the mean decay length, which is c * gamma tau0, and then find the point where 30% of the particles have decayed. But maybe the resolution required is the mean decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, another way: The resolution is the minimum distance the detector can measure. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a resolution better than L to see a certain fraction of the decays. Or perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution (distance) required is when 30% of the particles have decayed. So L is the distance where P=0.3.

Wait, I think my earlier approach is correct: P = 0.3 = 1 - e^(-L/(c tau)), which leads to L = c tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

So, tau is gamma tau_0.

Thus, L= c * gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(0.7)).

Compute that:

c = 3e8 m/s

gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approximately 7.916.

tau_0 =8e-16 s.

ln(1/0.7)=ln(1.42857) ≈0.35667.

So L=3e8 *7.916 *8e-16 *0.35667.

Compute each part:

3e8 is 3 *1e8.

7.916 ≈7.916.

8e-16 is 8e-16.

Multiply them all:

First, 3 *7.916 =23.748.

23.748 *8 =189.984.

So 3e8 *7.916 *8e-16 = 189.984e-8 = 1.89984e-6 meters.

Now multiply by 0.35667:

1.89984e-6 *0.35667 ≈ 6.76e-7 meters.

So L≈6.76e-7 m.

Hmm, but the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

None of these match 6.7e-7 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², the c² cancels out, so gamma is just E/m.

Wait, the energy is 27 GeV, but is that the total energy, or the kinetic energy? Because in particle physics, usually E is given as total energy, but sometimes it's kinetic. The question says 'the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV'—probably meaning the energy of the X⁰ particle is 27 GeV.

So the mass is 3.41 GeV/c², so gamma = 27 /3.41 = about 7.915.

That part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is about the proper time, and we need to calculate the distance using the lab frame lifetime. So perhaps the minimum resolution would be the distance the particle travels in its own lifetime multiplied by gamma. Wait, but that's the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the calculation is to find the minimum resolution such that the decay is observed. So the resolution should be higher than the decay length. Wait, but the question is about 'minimum resolution' to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be less than the decay length times 30%? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the resolution refers to the ability to measure the decay position. So, if the decay length is L, the detector's spatial resolution (or the minimum separation it can detect) must be less than L to see the decay. So, the minimum resolution needed is when L is as small as possible such that 30% of the decays occur within the detector's resolution.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the minimum resolution is such that the fraction of decays that happen within that resolution is 30%.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean decay length. The mean decay length is L = c gamma tau_0.

Mean L is 3e8 m/s * 7.9 *8e-16 s = let's compute:

3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6 m. So mean L is about 1.896e-6 meters, or 1.896 micrometers.

But to have 30% of the decays observed, perhaps the point where 30% have decayed is about 0.676e-6 meters (as calculated earlier), which is less than the mean.

But the options don't have 0.676e-6 m. The closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let me calculate 2.08e-6 m in terms of my variables.

If L=2.08e-6 m, then the probability P=1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau_0 )).

Compute L/(c gamma tau_0) = 2.08e-6 / (3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 )

Let me compute denominator:

3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6.

So L/(denominator)=2.08e-6 / 1.896e-6 ≈ 1.096.

So P=1 - exp(-1.096) ≈ 1 - 0.333 → 0.666 or 66.6%.

So if L is 2.08e-6 m, 66% of the particles decay. But the question asks for 30%, which would require a smaller L.

So why is option A 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is L = c tau_0 gamma ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, P is the probability of decay. So for P=0.3:

L = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7) ≈ c gamma tau_0 * 0.3567.

So, let's compute:

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=27/3.41≈7.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *0.3567.

Compute 3e8 =3 *1e8,

7.915 ≈8,

8e-16 is same.

So 3 *8=24, 24e8 *8e-16=24 *8 *1e-8= 192e-8=1.92e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.3567: 1.92e-6 * 0.3567≈ 6.86e-7 m.

Again, same result. So about 6.86e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula. Let me re-express this.

The decay length L is the average distance traveled before decay. The probability that the particle decays within a distance x is P=1 - exp(-x/L).

Wait, no, because L is the mean decay length. So P=1 - exp(-x/(L)).

So for x= L * ln(2), P=50%.

But in our case, P=30% → x= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * 0.3567.

So, x=0.3567 * L.

But L (mean decay length) is c gamma tau_0.

So x= 0.3567 * c gamma tau_0.

Which is the same result as earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length (L), not the x where P=30%.

But the question states: "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays."

So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector must be able to resolve the decay points. So the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution.

Wait, no. If the decay length is longer than the resolution, the detector can't pinpoint the decay accurately. Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance beyond which 30% of the decays are not detected. So the detector's resolution must be able to capture the decay within that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum decay length that can be resolved, i.e., the minimum L where the decay can be observed. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, what if I compute L (the mean decay length) as 3e8 m/s *7.9 *8e-16 s.

Which is 3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9, 2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6 m, which is 1.896 micrometers.

So the mean decay length is about 1.896e-6 m.

If the detector's resolution is better than 1.896e-6 m, then it can resolve the mean decay length. But the question is about 30% of the decays. So perhaps the required resolution is the L where 30% have decayed, which we calculated as about 0.676e-6 m, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, could the resolution be the distance the particle travels in its proper lifetime, which would be v tau_0. Since tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, v is approximately c. So v tau_0 = c tau_0 ≈3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m. That's 0.24 micrometers. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum resolution such that the majority of the decays are within that distance, which would be the mean decay length.

Wait, but the mean decay length is 1.896e-6 m, which is approximately 2e-6 m, which is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is about 2 micrometers. So perhaps the calculation is 3e8 *7.9*8e-16 =1.896e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps my gamma was wrong.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation.

E=27 GeV,

m=3.41 GeV/c².

Gamma = E/(m c^2) → but in units where c=1, m c^2 is in GeV. So gamma = E/(m) =27/3.41= approximately 7.915.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.41 * 7 =23.87,

3.41 * 7.9= 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 + 3.069=26.939. Close to 27. So 7.9 is correct.

So gamma is about 7.9.

Hmm, so why is the option 2.08e-6? Let me compute 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16.

Let me calculate 3e8 *7.9=2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16= (2.37 *8) *1e-7 →18.96e-7 →1.896e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m, close to option A (2.08e-6 m).

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the gamma. Let me compute E/m again.

E=27 GeV,

m=3.41 GeV/c².

Gamma = E/(m c²) → but in units where c=1, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², gamma is E/(m) = 27 /3.41= approximately 7.915.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation is 27 /3.41.

Let me compute 3.41 *7=23.87,

3.41 *7.9= 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27 -26.939=0.061. So 0.061/3.41≈0.0179.

So gamma is 7.9 +0.0179≈7.9179.

So about 7.918.

So L= c *gamma tau_0 = 3e8 *7.918 *8e-16.

Compute:

3e8 *7.918 = 2.3754e9.

2.3754e9 *8e-16= (2.3754 *8) *1e-7.

2.3754 *8 = 19.0032 → 19.0032e-7 → 1.90032e-6 m.

Which is about 1.900e-6 m.

Which is 1.9 micrometers. But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, what if the gamma is computed as E/(m c^2), but perhaps I should account for the units correctly.

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c².

So, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c^2).

But c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

But in units where c=1, the units would be:

E (GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c^2 → so GeV = gamma * GeV/c² * c^2 → GeV = gamma GeV, so gamma is unitless.

So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c^2 ) → which is 27/(3.41) → same as before.

So, same gamma as before.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the proper lifetime, but I used the lab frame. Or perhaps the velocity is not exactly c. Wait, but for high-energy particles, v≈c, so using v=c is a good approximation.

Another possibility is that the calculation is to find the minimum resolution, which is the decay length multiplied by (1 - exp(-x/L)), but perhaps I'm not getting the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relation L = gamma c tau_0, which is the mean decay length. So perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length, which is about 1.9e-6 m, which is about 2e-6 m. The option is A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but 2.08 is roughly 1.9 multiplied by 1.09, but why 2.08?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is 27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 ÷3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7=23.87,

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.9=3.069.

3.13-3.069=0.061.

So 3.41 *0.0179≈0.061.

So gamma=7.9179.

So, when I compute 3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16,

3e8 = 3 *10^8,

7.9179 *8=63.3432.

So, 3 *63.3432 =190.0296.

So 190.0296 *1e8 *1e-16 =190.0296 *1e-8 =1.900296e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.9003e-6 m, or 1.9003 micrometers.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Another approach: Maybe the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, that's a possibility. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kinetic + m c².

So, E_kinetic = 27 GeV.

Total energy E_total =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV.

So gamma = E_total / (m c²) =30.41 /3.41 ≈8.9.

So with this gamma, L = c * gamma tau0.

Compute:

3e8 *8.9 *8e-16.

3e8=3 *1e8,

8.9 *8=71.2.

3 *71.2=213.6.

213.6e-8 =2.136e-6 m.

Ah, that's about 2.136e-6 m, which is close to option A:2.08e-6 m.

So perhaps I was incorrect to assume that E is the total energy. Maybe E is the kinetic energy.

In the problem statement, it says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy.

If that's the case, then gamma would be (E_k + m c²)/m c² = (27 +3.41)/3.41 ≈30.41/3.41≈8.9.

So with gamma=8.9.

Then L=3e8 *8.9 *8e-16.

Compute:

3e8 *8.9=2.67e9,

2.67e9 *8e-16=2.67e9 *8e-16= (2.67 *8) *1e-7=21.36e-7=2.136e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.136e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close.

So perhaps the mistake was assuming E is the total energy, when it's actually the kinetic energy.

That would make the answer option A:2.08e-6 m.

So the minimum resolution needed is approximately 2.08e-6 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we analyze the decay process and calculate the distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, with the mass of \( X^0 \) being 3.41 GeV.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Energy and Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the relation:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
   \]
   Here, \( E \) is the total energy (given as 27 GeV), and \( m \) is the rest mass of \( X^0 \) (3.41 GeV/\( c^2 \)). Substituting:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Mean Decay Length (\( L \)):**
   The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:
   \[
   L = \gamma c \tau_0
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 7.915 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   L = 7.915 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L \approx 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   This is approximately \( 1.9 \, \mu\text{m} \).

3. **Decay Probability and Distance for 30% Decays:**
   The probability of decay within a distance \( x \) is:
   \[
   P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right)
   \]
   For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.3 = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right) \implies \frac{x}{L} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{1-0.3}\right) = \ln(1.4286) \approx 0.3567
   \]
   Substituting \( L \approx 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   x \approx 0.3567 \times 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \approx 6.76 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Revisiting the Energy Interpretation:**
   If the energy of 27 GeV is interpreted as the **kinetic energy** rather than the total energy, the total energy becomes:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{kinetic}} + m c^2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 \, \text{GeV}
   \]
   Recalculating \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{m c^2} = \frac{30.41}{3.41} \approx 8.9
   \]
   The mean decay length becomes:
   \[
   L = \gamma c \tau_0 = 8.9 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L \approx 2.136 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   This is approximately \( 2.14 \, \mu\text{m} \), which aligns closely with option A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)).

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), corresponding to option A.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation if they're moving at relativistic speeds. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So from the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer by a factor of gamma (γ), the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the question is about the resolution needed. I think resolution refers to the precision of the measurement, which in this case would be the minimum distance over which the decay can be observed. Because if the particles decay too far, they might leave a track that's too long, but if the chamber's resolution isn't good enough, it might not detect the decay accurately.

Wait, no. Maybe the minimum resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point. So if the decay length is too small, the detector can't resolve it. So the minimum resolution required would be such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for the mean decay length L is gamma * c * tau_0. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, and the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c for high-energy particles.

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/mc². Wait, E is the total energy, and for a relativistic particle, E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV for energy and mass. I think I can compute gamma as E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in GeV, and c is a constant, perhaps GeV units will cancel out. Let me think.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → but E is already given in units that include c², right? Because in particle physics, energy is often expressed as GeV, and mass as GeV/c². So when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², then E = gamma m c².

Wait, so E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But I'm not sure about the units. Let me think in terms of units:

E (GeV) = gamma * (m c²) → because m c² is in GeV (since m is GeV/c² multiplied by c² gives GeV).

So yes, gamma = E / (m c²). But since units-wise, E and m c^2 are both in GeV, gamma is just E / m.

Wait, because m c^2 is in GeV, and E is in GeV, so gamma would be E/(m c²) → which is (GeV) / (GeV) ) → unitless, which makes sense.

So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) → approximately 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me calculate: 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 *8 is about 27.28. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's take it as approximately 7.9.

So gamma is about 7.9.

Now, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0. So that's 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s → 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The decay length L is v * tau. Since v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L = v * tau ≈ c * tau.

So L = c * tau = c * gamma tau_0.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.32e-15 s → let me calculate that.

3e8 * 6.32e-15 = 3 * 6.32 * 1e-7 → 18.96e-7 meters → 1.896e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So maybe we're looking for the distance at which 30% of the particles have decayed. Because not all of them decay in the chamber.

The decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), but for a moving particle, it's 1 - exp(-L/(c*tau_0 * gamma))? Or wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

Wait, the decay probability P is 1 - exp(-t/tau), where t is the time the particle exists before decaying. But the distance it travels is L = v t. So alternatively, P = 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)).

Wait, but tau is gamma tau_0. So L/(v tau) = (L)/(gamma c tau_0). Since L = v t, and tau = gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the relation I should remember is that the probability a particle decays within a certain length is P = 1 - exp(-L/(c tau)).

Wait, no, considering that decay occurs over time, the probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), and t is the time the particle spends in the lab frame. But since L = v t ≈ c t, t = L/(c). So substituting, P = 1 - exp(- L/(c tau)).

Since tau = gamma tau_0, that becomes P = 1 - exp( - L/(c gamma tau_0) ).

We want P >= 0.3 (30%).

So 1 - exp(- L/(c gamma tau_0 )) = 0.3 → exp(-x) = 0.7, where x = L/(c gamma tau_0).

So x = ln(1/0.7) → ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So L = x * c gamma tau_0 = 0.3567 * c gamma tau_0.

We already have c=3e8 m/s, gamma ≈7.9, tau0=8e-16 s.

Calculate L:

0.3567 * 3e8 m/s * 7.9 *8e-16 s.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute the constants:

3e8 * 7.9 = 2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16 = 2.37e9 *8e-16 → 2.37 *8 is 18.96, and 1e9 *1e-16 = 1e-7.

So 18.96e-7 → 1.896e-6 meters.

Multiply by 0.3567:

0.3567 *1.896e-6 = let's see, approximately 0.3567 * 1.9e-6 ≈ 0.6777e-6 → 6.777e-7 meters, or 6.78e-7 m. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.3567 * 1.896 = ?

Let me compute 0.3567 * 1.896.

1.896 * 0.3 = 0.5688.

1.896 * 0.05 = 0.0948.

1.896 * 0.0067? Let's see, 1.896 * 0.006 is about 0.011376, and 0.0007 *1.896 is 0.0013272. So total is 0.0127032.

Adding them all: 0.5688 + 0.0948 = 0.6636 + 0.0127032 ≈ 0.6763032.

So 0.6763 *1e-6 meters → 6.763e-7 meters, approximately 6.76e-7 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of the options match 6.76e-7 m. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for L. Let me start over.

Another approach: The number of particles that decay is given by N = N0 (1 - exp(-t/tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime in the lab frame (tau = gamma tau0).

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay probability is lower.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the expected number of decays is 30%, so P = 0.3.

So, P = 1 - exp(- t/tau) = 0.3 → t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7)=0.3567.

But in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is tau = gamma tau0, so t = (gamma tau0) * 0.3567.

But the distance L = v t ≈ c t.

So L = c * gamma tau0 * 0.3567.

So substituting the numbers: c=3e8 m/s, gamma= ~7.9, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L = 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 * 0.3567.

Compute that:

3e8 =3 *1e8 =3e8.

7.9 ≈ 8.

8e-16 ≈8e-16.

So 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 0.3567: 2.4e-7 *0.3567 ≈8.56e-8 m.

Wait, that's 8.56e-8 meters, which is about 8.56e-8 m. Hmm, which is 0.856 nm. But none of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 *0.3567.

Let's compute each step numerically.

First, 3e8 *7.9 = 3 *7.9 *1e8 =23.7 *1e8 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16 = (2.37 *8) * 1e9 *1e-16 =18.96 *1e-7 =1.896e-6 m.

Then multiply by 0.3567: 1.896e-6 *0.3567 ≈ 6.76e-7 m → approximately 6.76e-7 meters, which is 0.676 micrometers or 676 nm.

But the options are all around 2.08e-6 m or similar.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the mean decay length, which is c * gamma tau0, and then find the point where 30% of the particles have decayed. But maybe the resolution required is the mean decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, another way: The resolution is the minimum distance the detector can measure. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a resolution better than L to see a certain fraction of the decays. Or perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution (distance) required is when 30% of the particles have decayed. So L is the distance where P=0.3.

Wait, I think my earlier approach is correct: P = 0.3 = 1 - e^(-L/(c tau)), which leads to L = c tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

So, tau is gamma tau_0.

Thus, L= c * gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(0.7)).

Compute that:

c = 3e8 m/s

gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approximately 7.916.

tau_0 =8e-16 s.

ln(1/0.7)=ln(1.42857) ≈0.35667.

So L=3e8 *7.916 *8e-16 *0.35667.

Compute each part:

3e8 is 3 *1e8.

7.916 ≈7.916.

8e-16 is 8e-16.

Multiply them all:

First, 3 *7.916 =23.748.

23.748 *8 =189.984.

So 3e8 *7.916 *8e-16 = 189.984e-8 = 1.89984e-6 meters.

Now multiply by 0.35667:

1.89984e-6 *0.35667 ≈ 6.76e-7 meters.

So L≈6.76e-7 m.

Hmm, but the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

None of these match 6.7e-7 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², the c² cancels out, so gamma is just E/m.

Wait, the energy is 27 GeV, but is that the total energy, or the kinetic energy? Because in particle physics, usually E is given as total energy, but sometimes it's kinetic. The question says 'the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV'—probably meaning the energy of the X⁰ particle is 27 GeV.

So the mass is 3.41 GeV/c², so gamma = 27 /3.41 = about 7.915.

That part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is about the proper time, and we need to calculate the distance using the lab frame lifetime. So perhaps the minimum resolution would be the distance the particle travels in its own lifetime multiplied by gamma. Wait, but that's the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the calculation is to find the minimum resolution such that the decay is observed. So the resolution should be higher than the decay length. Wait, but the question is about 'minimum resolution' to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be less than the decay length times 30%? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the resolution refers to the ability to measure the decay position. So, if the decay length is L, the detector's spatial resolution (or the minimum separation it can detect) must be less than L to see the decay. So, the minimum resolution needed is when L is as small as possible such that 30% of the decays occur within the detector's resolution.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the minimum resolution is such that the fraction of decays that happen within that resolution is 30%.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean decay length. The mean decay length is L = c gamma tau_0.

Mean L is 3e8 m/s * 7.9 *8e-16 s = let's compute:

3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6 m. So mean L is about 1.896e-6 meters, or 1.896 micrometers.

But to have 30% of the decays observed, perhaps the point where 30% have decayed is about 0.676e-6 meters (as calculated earlier), which is less than the mean.

But the options don't have 0.676e-6 m. The closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let me calculate 2.08e-6 m in terms of my variables.

If L=2.08e-6 m, then the probability P=1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau_0 )).

Compute L/(c gamma tau_0) = 2.08e-6 / (3e8 *7.9 *8e-16 )

Let me compute denominator:

3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6.

So L/(denominator)=2.08e-6 / 1.896e-6 ≈ 1.096.

So P=1 - exp(-1.096) ≈ 1 - 0.333 → 0.666 or 66.6%.

So if L is 2.08e-6 m, 66% of the particles decay. But the question asks for 30%, which would require a smaller L.

So why is option A 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is L = c tau_0 gamma ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, P is the probability of decay. So for P=0.3:

L = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7) ≈ c gamma tau_0 * 0.3567.

So, let's compute:

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=27/3.41≈7.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *0.3567.

Compute 3e8 =3 *1e8,

7.915 ≈8,

8e-16 is same.

So 3 *8=24, 24e8 *8e-16=24 *8 *1e-8= 192e-8=1.92e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.3567: 1.92e-6 * 0.3567≈ 6.86e-7 m.

Again, same result. So about 6.86e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula. Let me re-express this.

The decay length L is the average distance traveled before decay. The probability that the particle decays within a distance x is P=1 - exp(-x/L).

Wait, no, because L is the mean decay length. So P=1 - exp(-x/(L)).

So for x= L * ln(2), P=50%.

But in our case, P=30% → x= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * 0.3567.

So, x=0.3567 * L.

But L (mean decay length) is c gamma tau_0.

So x= 0.3567 * c gamma tau_0.

Which is the same result as earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length (L), not the x where P=30%.

But the question states: "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays."

So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector must be able to resolve the decay points. So the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution.

Wait, no. If the decay length is longer than the resolution, the detector can't pinpoint the decay accurately. Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance beyond which 30% of the decays are not detected. So the detector's resolution must be able to capture the decay within that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum decay length that can be resolved, i.e., the minimum L where the decay can be observed. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, what if I compute L (the mean decay length) as 3e8 m/s *7.9 *8e-16 s.

Which is 3e8 *7.9 =2.37e9, 2.37e9 *8e-16=1.896e-6 m, which is 1.896 micrometers.

So the mean decay length is about 1.896e-6 m.

If the detector's resolution is better than 1.896e-6 m, then it can resolve the mean decay length. But the question is about 30% of the decays. So perhaps the required resolution is the L where 30% have decayed, which we calculated as about 0.676e-6 m, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, could the resolution be the distance the particle travels in its proper lifetime, which would be v tau_0. Since tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, v is approximately c. So v tau_0 = c tau_0 ≈3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m. That's 0.24 micrometers. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum resolution such that the majority of the decays are within that distance, which would be the mean decay length.

Wait, but the mean decay length is 1.896e-6 m, which is approximately 2e-6 m, which is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is about 2 micrometers. So perhaps the calculation is 3e8 *7.9*8e-16 =1.896e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps my gamma was wrong.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation.

E=27 GeV,

m=3.41 GeV/c².

Gamma = E/(m c^2) → but in units where c=1, m c^2 is in GeV. So gamma = E/(m) =27/3.41= approximately 7.915.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.41 * 7 =23.87,

3.41 * 7.9= 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 + 3.069=26.939. Close to 27. So 7.9 is correct.

So gamma is about 7.9.

Hmm, so why is the option 2.08e-6? Let me compute 3e8 *7.9 *8e-16.

Let me calculate 3e8 *7.9=2.37e9.

2.37e9 *8e-16= (2.37 *8) *1e-7 →18.96e-7 →1.896e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m, close to option A (2.08e-6 m).

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the gamma. Let me compute E/m again.

E=27 GeV,

m=3.41 GeV/c².

Gamma = E/(m c²) → but in units where c=1, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², gamma is E/(m) = 27 /3.41= approximately 7.915.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation is 27 /3.41.

Let me compute 3.41 *7=23.87,

3.41 *7.9= 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27 -26.939=0.061. So 0.061/3.41≈0.0179.

So gamma is 7.9 +0.0179≈7.9179.

So about 7.918.

So L= c *gamma tau_0 = 3e8 *7.918 *8e-16.

Compute:

3e8 *7.918 = 2.3754e9.

2.3754e9 *8e-16= (2.3754 *8) *1e-7.

2.3754 *8 = 19.0032 → 19.0032e-7 → 1.90032e-6 m.

Which is about 1.900e-6 m.

Which is 1.9 micrometers. But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, what if the gamma is computed as E/(m c^2), but perhaps I should account for the units correctly.

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c².

So, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c^2).

But c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

But in units where c=1, the units would be:

E (GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c^2 → so GeV = gamma * GeV/c² * c^2 → GeV = gamma GeV, so gamma is unitless.

So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c^2 ) → which is 27/(3.41) → same as before.

So, same gamma as before.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the proper lifetime, but I used the lab frame. Or perhaps the velocity is not exactly c. Wait, but for high-energy particles, v≈c, so using v=c is a good approximation.

Another possibility is that the calculation is to find the minimum resolution, which is the decay length multiplied by (1 - exp(-x/L)), but perhaps I'm not getting the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relation L = gamma c tau_0, which is the mean decay length. So perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length, which is about 1.9e-6 m, which is about 2e-6 m. The option is A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but 2.08 is roughly 1.9 multiplied by 1.09, but why 2.08?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is 27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 ÷3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7=23.87,

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.9=3.069.

3.13-3.069=0.061.

So 3.41 *0.0179≈0.061.

So gamma=7.9179.

So, when I compute 3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16,

3e8 = 3 *10^8,

7.9179 *8=63.3432.

So, 3 *63.3432 =190.0296.

So 190.0296 *1e8 *1e-16 =190.0296 *1e-8 =1.900296e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.9003e-6 m, or 1.9003 micrometers.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Another approach: Maybe the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, that's a possibility. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kinetic + m c².

So, E_kinetic = 27 GeV.

Total energy E_total =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV.

So gamma = E_total / (m c²) =30.41 /3.41 ≈8.9.

So with this gamma, L = c * gamma tau0.

Compute:

3e8 *8.9 *8e-16.

3e8=3 *1e8,

8.9 *8=71.2.

3 *71.2=213.6.

213.6e-8 =2.136e-6 m.

Ah, that's about 2.136e-6 m, which is close to option A:2.08e-6 m.

So perhaps I was incorrect to assume that E is the total energy. Maybe E is the kinetic energy.

In the problem statement, it says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy.

If that's the case, then gamma would be (E_k + m c²)/m c² = (27 +3.41)/3.41 ≈30.41/3.41≈8.9.

So with gamma=8.9.

Then L=3e8 *8.9 *8e-16.

Compute:

3e8 *8.9=2.67e9,

2.67e9 *8e-16=2.67e9 *8e-16= (2.67 *8) *1e-7=21.36e-7=2.136e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.136e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close.

So perhaps the mistake was assuming E is the total energy, when it's actually the kinetic energy.

That would make the answer option A:2.08e-6 m.

So the minimum resolution needed is approximately 2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we analyze the decay process and calculate the distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, with the mass of \( X^0 \) being 3.41 GeV.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Energy and Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the relation:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
   \]
   Here, \( E \) is the total energy (given as 27 GeV), and \( m \) is the rest mass of \( X^0 \) (3.41 GeV/\( c^2 \)). Substituting:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Mean Decay Length (\( L \)):**
   The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:
   \[
   L = \gamma c \tau_0
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 7.915 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   L = 7.915 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L \approx 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   This is approximately \( 1.9 \, \mu\text{m} \).

3. **Decay Probability and Distance for 30% Decays:**
   The probability of decay within a distance \( x \) is:
   \[
   P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right)
   \]
   For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.3 = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right) \implies \frac{x}{L} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{1-0.3}\right) = \ln(1.4286) \approx 0.3567
   \]
   Substituting \( L \approx 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   x \approx 0.3567 \times 1.896 \times 10^{-6} \approx 6.76 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Revisiting the Energy Interpretation:**
   If the energy of 27 GeV is interpreted as the **kinetic energy** rather than the total energy, the total energy becomes:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{kinetic}} + m c^2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 \, \text{GeV}
   \]
   Recalculating \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{m c^2} = \frac{30.41}{3.41} \approx 8.9
   \]
   The mean decay length becomes:
   \[
   L = \gamma c \tau_0 = 8.9 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L \approx 2.136 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   This is approximately \( 2.14 \, \mu\text{m} \), which aligns closely with option A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)).

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), corresponding to option A.
