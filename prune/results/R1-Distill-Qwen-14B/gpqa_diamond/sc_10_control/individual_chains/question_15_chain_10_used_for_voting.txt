Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected these via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 has a period of P1 and Planet_2 has P2 where P2 = 3*P1. Got it.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars have same radii, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Oh, and both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Radius same, but mass different. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the size of the star's orbit. The basic formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else... Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / a)² * something else? Or is it (R_p / R_*)?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that, from our point of view, the planet passes directly in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a is much larger than R_star, then the probability is small. So the probability is proportional to (R_star) / a. Or more accurately, the probability is (R_*) / a, but only if the orbit is edge-on.

Wait, no. The formula for the transit probability (assuming circular orbit and random orientation) is (R_p + R_*) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximated as R_* / a. So the probability is higher when the star is larger or the planet's orbital radius is smaller.

Wait, no, I think that formula is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbital plane at the star's position. Hmm, maybe it's (R_*) / a, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_*)² / (a²). No, that doesn't sound right either.

Wait, I've read before that the transit probability is proportional to (R_*) / a. So the probability is higher if the star is bigger or the planet is closer. Because a smaller a means the planet is more likely to pass in front.

Wait, let's think in terms of geometry. Imagine the star as a disc of radius R_*, and the planet's orbit as a circle of radius a. The probability that the planet's path (which is a point, since it's much smaller) crosses the star's disk is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit? No, wait, that's not correct. The area of the star is πR_*/², and the area of the planet's orbital plane (as seen edge-on) is πa². So the probability would be (R_*²) / (a²) * (some factor). Wait, no, because the planet's position in its orbit is a point, so maybe it's (R_* / a)² multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So, the star's diameter is 2R_*, and the planet's orbital diameter is 2a. So the probability would be (2R_*)/(2a) )²? No, that would be (R_* / a)^2, but that can't be right because if a is much bigger than R_*, the probability is very small. But if a is small, the probability is higher.

Wait, no, the transit probability formula is actually (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. But wait, that would give a probability greater than 1 if a is smaller than R_*, which is impossible. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_* / a )² multiplied by a geometric factor. Or maybe it's (R_* / a ) * (something else), but I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_* / a)² multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital inclination. Wait, no, because that would lead to probabilities much less than 1. Or perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2. No, that doesn't make sense when a is large.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is (R_* / a) * (some factor). Oh wait, maybe it's (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_*))², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_*/a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about Kepler's third law. Since we know the masses of the stars and the orbital periods, perhaps we can find the semi-major axes of the planets.

The formula for the semi-major axis (a) in Kepler's third law is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) )/(4π²) * P². But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 ≈ (G M_* P²)/(4 π²).

So, a ∝ (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ?

Wait, let me write the formula properly. a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 π² ) ). So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3).

But since both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses, and their periods are different. Let's find a1 and a2.

Given:
M1 = 2 M2 (since Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's)
P1 = (1/3) P2 (because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's)

So their semi-major axes a1 and a2 can be found using Kepler's law.

So a1 = [ (G M1 P1² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ (G M2 P2² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = (1/3) P2.

Let's compute a1 in terms of a2.

a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²)
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π²) * (2 * (1/9) )
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π²) * (2/9) )

But a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 = a2^3 * (2/9) )

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) )

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3) : 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 = (2)/(3²) = 2/3^2. The cube root is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3) ) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is about 0.606 times that of Planet_2.

Now, transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because, as the planet's orbit is larger, the chance it transits is lower. So if a is smaller, the transit probability is higher.

So transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a).

Wait, but the stars have the same radii. Both host stars have same R_*, so R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So, for Planet_1, transit probability P1_prob = (R / a1 )

For Planet_2, P2_prob = (R / a2 )

So the ratio P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = (a2)/(a1)

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1_prob is about 1.65 times P2_prob. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So researchers prefer Planet_1.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors? Oh, the planet's size. Both are Earth-like, so their radii are the same. So R_p is same for both.

So, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (something else). Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let's get this straight.

The transit probability is the probability that, in a random orientation, the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The formula for the probability is:

P_transit = (R_* + R_p)/(a) * ( (R_* + R_p) / (a) )? No, wait, not exactly.

Wait, another way: the transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately (R_*/a)² * (something), or maybe (R_*)/(a) * (something else).

Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll think.

The transit probability is the area of the star's disk as seen from the planet's position, divided by the cross-sectional area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, transit probability is the probability that the planet's path (which is a circle in 3D space) intersects the line of sight to the star. For a random inclination, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter.

So, the probability is (2 R_*) / (2 a) ) = R_* / a. Because the orbital diameter is 2a.

Wait, that makes sense. So P_transit = R_* / (a). But only if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. Wait, but since the orbit is random, the actual probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So higher probability when a is smaller.

So, P1_prob = R/(a1)
P2_prob = R/(a2)

So the ratio P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So P1_prob is 1.65 times higher than P2_prob.

Thus, the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of a1 and a2.

We had a1^3 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2) / (4 π² G) )

Wait, wait, more accurately, the formula is a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² )

So,

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P1)^2 )/(4 π² )
But P1 = P2/3, so:

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2/3)^2 )/(4 π² )
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² ) * (2) / 9 )

Which is a1^3 = (a2^3) * (2/9 ). So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) )

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2 is about 2, 9 is 3². 2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606 since 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So P1's transit prob is (R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (R/a2)*1.65.

So P1_prob is about 1.65 times P2_prob.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Yes.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the key factor is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets:

1. **Planet_1**: Host star mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto (2M_{*,2}) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \).

2. **Planet_2**: Host star mass \( M_{*,2} \), orbital period \( P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_2^3 \propto M_{*,2} P_2^2
   \]
   Thus, \( a_2 \) is the reference semi-major axis.

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]
This means \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{R_* / a_1}{R_* / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**

Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

They've already detected these via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 has a period of P1 and Planet_2 has P2 where P2 = 3*P1. Got it.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars have same radii, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Oh, and both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Radius same, but mass different. Interesting.

Because if a is much larger than R_star, then the probability is small. So the probability is proportional to (R_star) / a. Or more accurately, the probability is (R_*) / a, but only if the orbit is edge-on.

The probability that the planet's path (which is a point, since it's much smaller) crosses the star's disk is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit? No, wait, that's not correct. The area of the star is πR_*/², and the area of the planet's orbital plane (as seen edge-on) is πa². So the probability would be (R_*²) / (a²) * (some factor). Wait, no, because the planet's position in its orbit is a point, so maybe it's (R_* / a)² multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So, the star's diameter is 2R_*, and the planet's orbital diameter is 2a. So the probability would be (2R_*)/(2a) )²? No, that would be (R_* / a)^2, but that can't be right because if a is much bigger than R_*, the probability is very small. But if a is small, the probability is higher.

Wait, no, the transit probability formula is actually (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. But wait, that would give a probability greater than 1 if a is smaller than R_*, which is impossible. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_* / a )² multiplied by a geometric factor. Or maybe it's (R_* / a ) * (something else), but I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_* / a)² multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital inclination.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is (R_* / a) * (some factor). Oh wait, maybe it's (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_*))², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_*/a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about Kepler's third law. Since we know the masses of the stars and the orbital periods, perhaps we can find the semi-major axes of the planets.

The formula for the semi-major axis (a) in Kepler's third law is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) )/(4π²) * P². But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 ≈ (G M_* P²)/(4 π²).

So, a ∝ (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ?

Wait, let me write the formula properly. a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 π² ) ). So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3).

But since both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses, and their periods are different. Let's find a1 and a2.

Given:
M1 = 2 M2 (since Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's)
P1 = (1/3) P2 (because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's)

So their semi-major axes a1 and a2 can be found using Kepler's law.

So a1 = [ (G M1 P1² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ (G M2 P2² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = (1/3) P2.

Let's compute a1 in terms of a2.

a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²)
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π²) * (2 * (1/9) )
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π²) * (2/9) )

But a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 = a2^3 * (2/9) )

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) )

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3) : 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 = (2)/(3²) = 2/3^2. The cube root is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3) ) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is about 0.606 times that of Planet_2.

Now, transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because, as the planet's orbit is larger, the chance it transits is lower. So if a is smaller, the transit probability is higher.

So transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a).

Wait, but the stars have the same radii. Both host stars have same R_*, so R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So, for Planet_1, transit probability P1_prob = (R / a1 )

For Planet_2, P2_prob = (R / a2 )

So the ratio P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = (a2)/(a1)

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1_prob is about 1.65 times P2_prob. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So researchers prefer Planet_1.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors? Oh, the planet's size. Both are Earth-like, so their radii are the same. So R_p is same for both.

So, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (something else). Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let's get this straight.

The transit probability is the probability that, in a random orientation, the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The formula for the probability is:

P_transit = (R_* + R_p)/(a) * ( (R_* + R_p) / (a) )? No, wait, not exactly.

Wait, another way: the transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately (R_*/a)² * (something), or maybe (R_*)/(a) * (something else).

Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll think.

Wait, transit probability is the probability that the planet's path (which is a circle in 3D space) intersects the line of sight to the star. For a random inclination, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter.

So, the probability is (2 R_*) / (2 a) ) = R_* / a. Because the orbital diameter is 2a.

Wait, that makes sense. So P_transit = R_* / (a). But only if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. Wait, but since the orbit is random, the actual probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So higher probability when a is smaller.

So, P1_prob = R/(a1)
P2_prob = R/(a2)

So the ratio P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So P1_prob is 1.65 times higher than P2_prob.

Thus, the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of a1 and a2.

We had a1^3 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2) / (4 π² G) )

Wait, wait, more accurately, the formula is a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² )

So,

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P1)^2 )/(4 π² )
But P1 = P2/3, so:

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2/3)^2 )/(4 π² )
= (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² ) * (2) / 9 )

Which is a1^3 = (a2^3) * (2/9 ). So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) )

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2 is about 2, 9 is 3². 2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606 since 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So P1's transit prob is (R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (R/a2)*1.65.

So P1_prob is about 1.65 times P2_prob.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Yes.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the key factor is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets:

1. **Planet_1**: Host star mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto (2M_{*,2}) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \).

2. **Planet_2**: Host star mass \( M_{*,2} \), orbital period \( P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_2^3 \propto M_{*,2} P_2^2
   \]
   Thus, \( a_2 \) is the reference semi-major axis.

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]
This means \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{R_* / a_1}{R_* / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**

Answer: C
