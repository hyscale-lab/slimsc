Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the spectral data given. Alright, let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion plus 2 suggests maybe some kind of adduct or isotope? Wait, the molecular weight is 156, so the molecular formula would be around that. The small increase could be due to chlorine or something else. Let me think.

Next up is the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate either an -OH stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch, but since the options don't seem to have amines, I'll focus on -OH. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group. Carbonyl could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The exact position can help determine the type. Aldehydes are usually around 1720, but carboxylic acids have a lower wavenumber, like around 1700. Wait, 1720 is a bit higher, maybe an ester or aldehyde. Or maybe a benzoic acid, but let me not jump yet.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. We have:

- 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. That's a very high chemical shift. Typically, that's a phenolic OH proton or a carboxylic acid OH. But wait, in DMSO, the carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. Phenolic OHs are also around that region but might be a bit lower or broader. But in the NMR here, it's a singlet, so maybe it's not a broad peak. Also, if it's a phenolic OH, why is it a singlet? Phenolic protons can be split, but sometimes in certain structures they might be deshielded and appear as singlets. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is usually a singlet if it's exchanging but can be broad. Wait, but the integration is 1H, which fits both cases.

Next, the NMR shows 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, and they're at similar positions. For example, in a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents opposite each other.

Putting that together with the IR, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe a substituted benzoic acid or a benzaldehyde.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at 2. The NMR would have a benzaldehyde proton, but wait, benzaldehyde protons are usually around 9.8-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. Hmm, maybe that's not fitting. Also, the aldehyde proton isn't observed here because the NMR goes up to 11. So wait, the aldehyde proton would typically appear around 9-10 ppm, but in this case, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which might not be the aldehyde. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. The benzoic acid would have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, but wait, the given IR peak is at 1720. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is usually lower, around 1700. Then, the NMR: the COOH proton would be a broad peak around 11 ppm, but wait, in the NMR data, it's a singlet at 11.0. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually broad, but sometimes in DMSO it can be a sharp singlet if deuterated or under certain conditions. Also, the aromatic protons would be a para-substituted pattern. Since the substituent is Cl at position 4 (para to COOH), the two H's on the ring would be ortho and meta to Cl and COOH. Wait, for benzoic acid, the ring protons adjacent to COOH would be deshielded. Let me think about the splitting. If it's para-substituted, like Cl at 4 and COOH at 1, then the two H's on the ring would be in two sets: at positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. Wait, no, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be next to the COOH, and the H's at 3 and 5 next to Cl. So the 2 and 6 H's would be deshielded more, maybe at higher ppm (like 8.02), and the 3 and 5 H's would be lower, maybe around 7.72. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data. Also, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which would correspond to the -OH stretch of the carboxylic acid. The 1720 peak is slightly higher than usual, but perhaps because of substitution or the solvent. So this looks possible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OClCO-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show the carbonyl, which is at 1720, which fits. The phenyl group would have protons. But what would the NMR look like? Phenyl chloroformate would have the aromatic protons. Since the substituent is a ClCO group, which is strong electron-withdrawing, the aromatic protons would be deshielded. Also, would the aromatic be para-substituted? If the ClCO is attached to the benzene ring, perhaps in a particular position. Wait, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate is Cl (35.5) + COCl (60.5?) + benzene (78). So 35.5 + (12+16+35.5) = 35.5 +63.5=99 for COCl. 78+99=177. But the molecular ion is 156. So that doesn't fit. So option C is not possible.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the aromatic protons would be in ortho, meta positions. The NMR would show different splitting. For benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to COOH are more deshielded. So in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, let's see: if COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2, then the H's at 3 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded. But the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted structure. So maybe option D doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, but let me think again. The NMR data is 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a symmetrical substitution on the benzene ring, probably para. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has Cl and COOH para to each other, leading to two sets of doublets. That matches the NMR.

Another point: the molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Wait, so the molecular weight would be approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, but the exact molecular weight might account for isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's the M+2 peak? Wait, the question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). So the molecular ion is M+, and the 158 is likely M+2, which could be due to chlorine. Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 3% for the 35Cl (75Cl35, 25Cl37). So M would be 156 (all Cl as 35Cl), and M+2 would be 158 (Cl as 37Cl). So that matches with a molecule containing chlorine.

So for option B, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 156.5 (approx 156). So the M+ would be at 156, and M+2 at 158, which matches the data.

Another point: the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. For benzoic acid, that's a bit high. Usually, carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700. But substituents can affect this. Chlorine is electron-withdrawing, so it might increase the carbonyl stretching frequency, leading to a higher wavenumber. So 1720 could fit a chlorobenzoic acid.

The 1H NMR: The singlet at 11 ppm is the COOH proton. But wait, in DMSO-d6, carboxylic acids tend to show a broad peak, but sometimes they can be sharp if it's a deuterated solvent or if it's exchanged quickly. Alternatively, maybe the peak is a sharp singlet because it's not a broad peak. Hmm, but in the data, it's a singlet. Another possibility is that it's an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm, so not matching 11. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange process, like in D2O, but probably not.

Wait, another point about the IR: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a very broad region. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH stretch is usually a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So that matches. But what about an alcohol? If it were an alcohol, the -OH would be a broad peak, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So the presence of both a carbonyl and an -OH suggests a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol.

So putting it all together, the data points towards option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, let me check the other options again. Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would have an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group. The IR would show a carbonyl (aldehyde) at ~1720, which fits. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm, but in the data, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't fit that. Also, the aromatic protons in option A would be more complex. Let's think: the benzaldehyde would have a proton next to the aldehyde, which would be a doublet. But with the OH and Cl substitution, the aromatic protons might split into more peaks, but the data shows only two doublets. So perhaps it's not fitting.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would have Cl and COOH in the ortho positions. The NMR would show a different pattern for the aromatic protons. For example, the protons adjacent to Cl and COOH would be deshielded. But the NMR data shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para substitution pattern, so option D might not fit.

So, considering all the data, the most likely answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Molecular Weight and Mass Spectrometry
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156 (100%)**, and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggests the presence of chlorine (Cl), as chlorine isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37) account for the M and M+2 peaks. The molecular formula is consistent with **C7H5ClO2**, giving a molecular weight of approximately 156.5.

### IR Spectroscopy
- A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl group. The slightly higher wavenumber than typical for carboxylic acids (usually ~1700 cm⁻¹) can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine substituent.

### ¹H NMR Spectroscopy
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- Two **doublets** at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring. This splitting pattern is consistent with a benzene ring where two substituents (e.g., Cl and COOH) are in the para positions.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
   - This compound contains both an aldehyde (-CHO) and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The aldehyde proton would appear as a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm in the NMR, but the data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which does not match. Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern would be more complex than the observed two doublets. **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine substituent in the para position on the benzene ring. The IR data matches the -OH stretch of a carboxylic acid and the carbonyl stretch. The NMR data is consistent with the para-substituted aromatic ring (two doublets) and the carboxylic acid proton as a singlet at 11.0 ppm. The molecular weight also aligns with the spectral data. **Matches all criteria.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**
   - Phenyl chloroformate has the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph. While the IR carbonyl peak might fit, the molecular weight is significantly higher (~177), inconsistent with the molecular ion at m/z = 156. **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid and chlorine in the ortho position. The aromatic proton pattern would differ from the observed data, as the ortho substitution would result in more complex splitting. The NMR data strongly suggests a para-substituted ring. **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The spectral data (molecular weight, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.

Next, the NMR shows 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, and they're at similar positions. For example, in a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents opposite each other.

Putting that together with the IR, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe a substituted benzoic acid or a benzaldehyde.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at 2. The NMR would have a benzaldehyde proton, but wait, benzaldehyde protons are usually around 9.8-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72.

The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, but wait, the given IR peak is at 1720. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is usually lower, around 1700. Then, the NMR: the COOH proton would be a broad peak around 11 ppm, but wait, in the NMR data, it's a singlet at 11.0. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually broad, but sometimes in DMSO it can be a sharp singlet if deuterated or under certain conditions. Also, the aromatic protons would be a para-substituted pattern. Since the substituent is Cl at position 4 (para to COOH), the two H's on the ring would be ortho and meta to Cl and COOH.

If it's para-substituted, like Cl at 4 and COOH at 1, then the two H's on the ring would be in two sets: at positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. Wait, no, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be next to the COOH, and the H's at 3 and 5 next to Cl. So the 2 and 6 H's would be deshielded more, maybe at higher ppm (like 8.02), and the 3 and 5 H's would be lower, maybe around 7.72. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data. Also, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which would correspond to the -OH stretch of the carboxylic acid. The 1720 peak is slightly higher than usual, but perhaps because of substitution or the solvent. So this looks possible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OClCO-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show the carbonyl, which is at 1720, which fits. The phenyl group would have protons. But what would the NMR look like? Phenyl chloroformate would have the aromatic protons.

So 35.5 + (12+16+35.5) = 35.5 +63.5=99 for COCl. 78+99=177. But the molecular ion is 156. So that doesn't fit. So option C is not possible.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the aromatic protons would be in ortho, meta positions. The NMR would show different splitting. For benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to COOH are more deshielded. So in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, let's see: if COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2, then the H's at 3 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded. But the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted structure. So maybe option D doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, but let me think again. The NMR data is 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a symmetrical substitution on the benzene ring, probably para. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has Cl and COOH para to each other, leading to two sets of doublets. That matches the NMR.

Another point: the molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Wait, so the molecular weight would be approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, but the exact molecular weight might account for isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's the M+2 peak? Wait, the question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). So the molecular ion is M+, and the 158 is likely M+2, which could be due to chlorine. Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 3% for the 35Cl (75Cl35, 25Cl37). So M would be 156 (all Cl as 35Cl), and M+2 would be 158 (Cl as 37Cl). So that matches with a molecule containing chlorine.

So for option B, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 156.5 (approx 156). So the M+ would be at 156, and M+2 at 158, which matches the data.

Another point: the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. For benzoic acid, that's a bit high. Usually, carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700. But substituents can affect this. Chlorine is electron-withdrawing, so it might increase the carbonyl stretching frequency, leading to a higher wavenumber. So 1720 could fit a chlorobenzoic acid.

The 1H NMR: The singlet at 11 ppm is the COOH proton. But wait, in DMSO-d6, carboxylic acids tend to show a broad peak, but sometimes they can be sharp if it's a deuterated solvent or if it's exchanged quickly. Alternatively, maybe the peak is a sharp singlet because it's not a broad peak. Hmm, but in the data, it's a singlet. Another possibility is that it's an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm, so not matching 11. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange process, like in D2O, but probably not.

Wait, another point about the IR: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a very broad region. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH stretch is usually a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So that matches. But what about an alcohol? If it were an alcohol, the -OH would be a broad peak, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So the presence of both a carbonyl and an -OH suggests a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol.

So putting it all together, the data points towards option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, let me check the other options again. Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would have an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group. The IR would show a carbonyl (aldehyde) at ~1720, which fits. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm, but in the data, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't fit that. Also, the aromatic protons in option A would be more complex. Let's think: the benzaldehyde would have a proton next to the aldehyde, which would be a doublet. But with the OH and Cl substitution, the aromatic protons might split into more peaks, but the data shows only two doublets. So perhaps it's not fitting.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would have Cl and COOH in the ortho positions. The NMR would show a different pattern for the aromatic protons. For example, the protons adjacent to Cl and COOH would be deshielded. But the NMR data shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para substitution pattern, so option D might not fit.

So, considering all the data, the most likely answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Molecular Weight and Mass Spectrometry
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156 (100%)**, and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggests the presence of chlorine (Cl), as chlorine isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37) account for the M and M+2 peaks. The molecular formula is consistent with **C7H5ClO2**, giving a molecular weight of approximately 156.5.

### IR Spectroscopy
- A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl group. The slightly higher wavenumber than typical for carboxylic acids (usually ~1700 cm⁻¹) can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine substituent.

### ¹H NMR Spectroscopy

   - This compound contains both an aldehyde (-CHO) and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The aldehyde proton would appear as a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm in the NMR, but the data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which does not match. Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern would be more complex than the observed two doublets. **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine substituent in the para position on the benzene ring. The IR data matches the -OH stretch of a carboxylic acid and the carbonyl stretch. The NMR data is consistent with the para-substituted aromatic ring (two doublets) and the carboxylic acid proton as a singlet at 11.0 ppm. The molecular weight also aligns with the spectral data. **Matches all criteria.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**
   - Phenyl chloroformate has the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph. While the IR carbonyl peak might fit, the molecular weight is significantly higher (~177), inconsistent with the molecular ion at m/z = 156. **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid and chlorine in the ortho position. The aromatic proton pattern would differ from the observed data, as the ortho substitution would result in more complex splitting. The NMR data strongly suggests a para-substituted ring. **Eliminated.**

The spectral data (molecular weight, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.
