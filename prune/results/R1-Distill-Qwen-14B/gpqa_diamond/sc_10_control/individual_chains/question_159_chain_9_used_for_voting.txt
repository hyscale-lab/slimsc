Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that quasars emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum, and their spectra can tell us a lot about the universe. The question mentions a peak in the near-infrared and optical spectrum at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. So, the peak is around 790 nm, which I think is in the near-infrared part.

Wait, I recall that when we observe a quasar, the peak of its emission could be due to various factors. One possibility is that the peak is from a Lyman break. The Lyman series is from hydrogen, and the Lyman-alpha transition is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. But if the quasar is very far away, its light gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted one.

The peak is at 790 nm. So if 790 is the observed wavelength, then the emitted wavelength would be shorter. Let me think: Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is longer, that means the source is moving away, so redshift (z) is (observed - emitted)/emitted. Wait, wait, the formula is z = (observed λ - rest λ) / rest λ, right? So z would be (790 - 121)/121 ≈ 669/121 ≈ 5.528. That's a high redshift.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance is the distance to a distant object, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance D_C is related to the redshift z. But how do I calculate D_C given the cosmological parameters?

The given cosmological parameters are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0). So these are standard Lambda-CDM parameters.

I think the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1 (since a=1 is the current scale factor). But wait, wait, no: the comoving distance is the integral from a=0 to a=1, but the actual formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1/(E(z'))] dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Because the comoving distance is calculated as the integral of the inverse of the Hubble parameter over redshift.

But wait, when integrating for comoving distance, the formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'.

So with z ≈ 5.5, and given the cosmology, I need to compute this integral. But I don't remember the exact value. Maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time or age of the universe at a certain redshift, but that might not directly give the comoving distance.

Wait, but perhaps I can refer to standard cosmology tables. I remember that for high redshifts, comoving distances are in the several Gpc range. For example, at z=1, comoving distance is about 2 Gpc, but as z increases, the comoving distance increases.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait. For example, at z=0.5, D_C is about 2 Gpc. At z=1, it's about 6 Gpc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing comoving and proper distances. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the approximate relation between redshift and comoving distance. For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance for high redshifts can be found using the formula, but without exact computation, it's tricky.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe. The age at redshift z is the integral from 0 to z (1/(E(z') (1+z')) ) dz'. But I'm not sure if that helps with the comoving distance.

Wait, another approach. The luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C. But the question is about the comoving distance, which is D_C = D_L / (1 + z).

But wait, the question says, "the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth." Wait, scale factor a=1 is now. So the comoving distance is the same as the distance now. Hmm, perhaps not—comoving distance is a way to express the distance that accounts for expansion, so it's the proper distance at the time of emission, scaled by (1+z).

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is the distance that would be measured by someone at the same time as us, but at the location of the quasar. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps another way: the peak wavelength is 790 nm, and if that corresponds to the Lyman break, then z is about (790 / 121) - 1. Wait, 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528.

Wait, let's calculate z exactly. Observed wavelength λ_obs = 790 nm, rest λ_emitted = 121 nm. So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 / 121) - 1 ≈ 6.5289 - 1 ≈ 5.5289. So z ≈ 5.53.

So the quasar is at a redshift of about 5.53. Now, the question is about comoving distance. So D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) 1/E(z') dz', where E(z') = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ ). And H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

Wait, H0 is given as 70, so c is about 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is approximately (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.285 Gpc.

So the integral part is the function of z, which for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, depends on the integrand. Let's compute the integral numerically.

Wait, but without an exact calculator, perhaps I can recall that for z=5 with Ω_m=0.3, the comoving distance is roughly around 10 Gpc. But wait, wait, I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can use some approximation methods or look up standard values. For a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance for a redshift z can be calculated with the integral.

But perhaps I can refer to an online calculator or remember some key points. Let me think. For z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc (if H0=70), but that's probably not correct. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up between H0 and the comoving distance. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so c = 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.2857 Gpc. So the comoving distance is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral.

So for z=5.5, the integral ∫0^z [1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7)} ] dz' is what I need to compute.

Let me try to approximate the integral. Since z is 5.5, which is quite high, the universe's expansion history is such that at high z, matter dominates, but dark energy becomes significant at lower z.

So the integrand 1/(sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7)).

At very high z, 0.3(1+z')^3 dominates, so the integrand ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)).

But for more accurate calculation, perhaps split the integral into two parts: from z'=0 to a point where dark energy becomes important, say z=2, and from z=2 to z=5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for high z, the comoving distance increases roughly as (1+z)^{1/2} when matter-dominated.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance can be approximated for a flat universe as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ (2/3) (1+z)^{3/2}/(sqrt(Ω_m)) ) ] for matter-dominated era, but that's only applicable when z is very high, and dark energy isn't contributing much. For lower z, dark energy starts to dominate, but at z=5.5, matter density is higher.

Wait, let's compute E(z) at various points:

At z=5.5, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+5.5)^3 +0.7) → 0.3*(6.5)^3 → 0.3*274.625≈82.3875; 82.3875 +0.7 =83.0875. So sqrt(83.0875) ≈9.115.

So at z=5.5, E(z)≈9.115, so 1/E(z)≈0.1097.

Wait, but the integral is from 0 to z. So perhaps it's better to approximate the integral by breaking it into parts where the function changes significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance for a flat universe.

Another idea: Use the formula for comoving distance as D_C = (c/H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the cosmology.

For a flat universe (Ω_r ~ 0, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), f(z) can be calculated with the integral:

∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)} ] dz'

Hmm, but without actually computing this integral, it's hard to get an exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can use a look-up table or approximate using some standard values. Let me try to think about known redshifts and their comoving distances.

I remember that for the standard cosmology (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), at z=1, D_C is approximately 2 Gpc. Wait, but earlier that seemed too low. Oh wait, perhaps that's using H0=70, so 2 Gpc would be (c/H0) * integral ≈ 4.285 Gpc * integral. So if D_C=2 Gpc, the integral would be about 0.468.

Wait, that can't be right, because for z=1, the integral would be less than 1. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing comoving distance with other distances. Let me think about a more concrete approach. Let me try to compute the integral for z=5.5 numerically.

I can approximate the integral by considering a few points.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can think of the comoving distance for high redshift. At high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so the integral would be similar to the matter-only case. Let's compute the matter-only D_C for z=5.5.

In a matter-only universe (Ω_m=1, Ω_Λ=0), E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 ) = (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integral becomes ∫0^5.5 [1/(1+z')^(3/2)] dz' = ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = [2/(1+z')] from 0 to 5.5.

So that's 2/(1+5.5) - 2/(1+0) = 2/6.5 - 2 = approx 0.3077 -2 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is:

Let u = 1 + z', so du=dz'

Integral u^(-3/2) du = (-2) u^(-1/2) + C.

So between 0 and 5.5, it's [ -2 (1/(sqrt(1+5.5)) ) ] - [ -2 (1/(sqrt(1+0)) ) ]

= -2/(sqrt(6.5)) + 2/(1)
≈ -2/(2.55) + 2 ≈ -0.784 + 2 = 1.216.

So in a matter-only universe, the integral is 1.216, so D_C= (c/H0)*1.216 ≈ (4.285 Gpc)*1.216 ≈ 5.21 Gpc.

But our universe has dark energy, so E(z) is larger at high z, meaning the integrand (1/E(z)) is smaller, so the integral would be less than 1.216. So the D_C would be less than 5.21 Gpc.

Wait, but wait: in a universe with dark energy, at high z, the matter density is higher, so E(z) is higher than in a matter-only universe. So 1/E(z) is smaller, hence the integral is smaller. So the comoving distance would be less than the matter-only case.

Hmm, but wait, in our universe, dark energy becomes dominant at lower z. At z=5.5, dark energy is not dominant because the matter density (Ω_m*(1+z)^3) is 0.3*(6.5)^3 ≈ 0.3 * 274.6 ≈ 82.38, and dark energy is 0.7, so total E(z)=sqrt(83.08)≈9.115. So it's still matter-dominated at z=5.5.

Wait, but the dark energy term is a constant, so E(z) = sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 + 0.7). So as z increases, the matter term (proportional to (1+z)^3) dominates, making E(z) larger, so the integrand 1/E(z) is smaller.

So for high z, the integral is approaching the matter-only case, but for z=5.5, it's a bit lower.

So the matter-only case gives 5.21 Gpc.

But in reality, dark energy contributes, so the integral would be slightly less than 1.216, perhaps around 1.1.

So D_C = 4.285 * 1.1 ≈ 4.71 Gpc. But wait, this is probably an underestimate because at z=5.5, the matter term is dominant, so the integral doesn't deviate too much from the matter-only case.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value.

Wait, another approach: Use the formula from the Friedmann equation to compute the comoving distance.

But without precise calculation, perhaps I can recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is around 10 Gpc. Hmm, but that seems high because in the matter-only case, z=5.5 gives about 5 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the luminosity distance. Luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C.

But the question is about comoving distance, which is D_C = D_L/(1+z).

But wait, perhaps the quasar's observed peak is due to the Lyman break. So if the Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm, and observed at 790 nm, z= (790/121) -1 ≈ 5.528.

Now, I need to find the comoving distance for this z under the given cosmology.

Wait, another thought: I found a table online once that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 is about 10 Gpc. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula.

The formula for comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'

Let me try to approximate this integral.

I can divide the integral into a few intervals and approximate each part.

Alternatively, perhaps use a table of the integral for given z. Let me think.

Wait, I found a source that for a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance for various redshifts is as follows:

z=0.5 → ≈1.66 Gpc

z=1 →≈3.37 Gpc

z=2 →≈5.43 Gpc

z=3 →≈6.67 Gpc

z=4 →≈7.24 Gpc

z=5 →≈7.54 Gpc

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense because as z increases, the comoving distance should increase. Wait, perhaps the numbers are in billions of parsecs?

Wait, no, perhaps the numbers are in units where c/H0 is about 14 billion ly, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the values.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe.

The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/(3*sqrt(Ω_m))) ) * [ ( (1 + z)^{3/2} ) / (1 + (3/2) Ω_Λ (1 + z)^{-3} ) ) ]^{-1/2} }

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use the Taylor expansion for the integrand.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral numerically.

Wait, let's compute the integrand at several points and approximate.

The integrand is f(z') = 1 / sqrt( 0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

Compute f at z'=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5.

At z'=0: 1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7) = 1/sqrt(1) =1.

z'=1: 1/sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7)= 1/sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=1/sqrt(3.1)=≈0.566.

z'=2:0.3*(27)=8.1 +0.7=8.8; sqrt(8.8)=2.966; 1/2.966≈0.3375.

z'=3:0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9; sqrt≈4.461; 1/4.461≈0.224.

z'=4:0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2 → sqrt≈6.18 → 1/6.18≈0.1617.

z'=5:0.3*216=64.8 +0.7=65.5 → sqrt≈8.09 →1/8.09≈0.1237.

z'=5.5:0.3*(6.5)^3 →6.5^3=274.625 →0.3*274.625=82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 →sqrt≈9.115 →1/9.115≈0.1097.

So now, I'll approximate the integral ∫0^5.5 f(z') dz' using the trapezoidal rule, using these points.

The trapezoidal rule estimates the integral by averaging the function at consecutive points and multiplying by the step. Let's take steps at z'=0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5.

So the intervals are from 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,4-5,5-5.5.

Compute the function at each interval midpoint for better accuracy, but perhaps for simplicity, just use the left endpoints.

Wait, no, the trapezoidal rule uses the average of endpoints for each interval.

So for each interval (z_i to z_{i+1}), the width is Δz = z_{i+1} - z_i.

The area for each interval is (f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1}))/2 * Δz.

So let's compute each interval:

Interval 0-1: Δz=1.

f(0)=1, f(1)=0.566 → area = (1 + 0.566)/2 *1 = 0.783.

Interval 1-2: Δz=1.

f(1)=0.566, f(2)=0.3375 → (0.566 +0.3375)/2 *1 = 0.45175.

Interval 2-3: Δz=1.

f(2)=0.3375, f(3)=0.224 → (0.3375 +0.224)/2 = 0.28075 → area=0.28075.

Interval 3-4: Δz=1.

f(3)=0.224, f(4)=0.1617 → (0.224 +0.1617)/2=0.19285 → area=0.19285.

Interval 4-5: Δz=1.

f(4)=0.1617, f(5)=0.1237 → (0.1617 +0.1237)/2=0.1427 → area=0.1427.

Interval 5-5.5: Δz=0.5.

f(5)=0.1237, f(5.5)=0.1097 → (0.1237 + 0.1097)/2=0.1167 → area=0.1167 * 0.5 = 0.05835.

Now sum all these areas:

0.783 + 0.45175 = 1.23475

+0.28075 →1.5155

+0.19285 →1.70835

+0.1427 →1.85105

+0.05835 →1.9094.

So the approximate integral is about 1.9094.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 1.9094.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5) /70 →≈4285.7 Mpc →≈4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C ≈4.2857 Gpc * 1.9094 ≈ let's compute:

4.2857 * 1.9094.

Let me compute 4 *1.9094=7.6376, 0.2857*1.9094≈0.2857*1.9=0.5428, so total≈7.6376 + 0.5428=8.1804 Gpc.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 4.2857 *1.9094.

Breaking it down: 4 *1.9094 = 7.6376.

0.2857 *1.9094 ≈ 0.2857 * 1.9094.

0.2857 *1 =0.2857; 0.2857 * 0.9094≈0.2607. So total ≈0.2857 +0.2607=0.5464.

So total D_C ≈7.6376 +0.5464=8.184 Gpc.

So approximately 8.18 Gpc.

Looking back at the options, the choices are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So 8.18 is closest to 8 Gpc. But wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So option B is 8 Gpc.

But wait, wait. Another thing to consider: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared, which is close to the Lyman break. So redshift z≈5.5. But in reality, the Lyman break is around 912 Angstroms, which is 91.2 nm. Wait, no, wait: Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, but the Lyman series emission can be broader. Wait, but the Lyman break is the wavelength beyond which the transmitted flux drops because of hydrogen absorption. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, the Lyman break would be at longer wavelengths (since higher z would redshift it more).

Wait, no. Wait, the Lyman break is the point where the transmitted flux drops due to the Lyman-alpha forest. So for a quasar at high redshift, the observed Lyman break would be in the near-infrared.

Wait, but the peak at 790 nm is the rest-frame wavelength? Or the observed?

Wait, the question says the peak is observed in the near-infrared and optical. So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So if the peak is from the Lyman series, then the rest wavelength is shorter. So for example, if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then z= (790/121)-1≈5.528.

But if the rest wavelength is longer, like from another line, then the redshift would be lower.

Wait, but the question states that the flux drops at wavelengths below 790 nm. So that suggests that the peak is at 790 and the drop is below, which would be consistent with the Lyman break. So the Lyman break occurs at 790 nm observed, which would correspond to the rest frame at shorter wavelength. So the Lyman break at 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm) would be redshifted to 790 nm: z = (790 /91.2 ) -1 ≈ 8.663 -1 =7.663.

Wait, that's a different z. So I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91.2 nm. So if the Lyman break is observed at 790 nm, then the quasar's rest frame Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm, so z = (790 /91.2 ) -1.

Let me compute that:

790 /91.2 ≈8.663 → z≈7.663.

That's a higher redshift than I previously thought. So z≈7.66.

So the redshift is higher, about 7.66.

So now, reevaluating the comoving distance with z=7.66.

Hmm, that's a higher redshift. So let's recalculate the integral.

But wait, this depends on whether the peak is the Lyman-alpha line or the Lyman limit. The peak at 790 nm could be the Lyman-alpha line (121 nm) redshifted, but if it's the Lyman limit (91.2 nm), then the redshift is higher.

Wait, the question says "a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly." That's the behavior of the Lyman break. The Lyman break is the point where the transmitted flux drops because of absorption by hydrogen. So the peak in the spectrum would be just blueward of the break, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the rest-frame optical, but observed in near-infrared. So if the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm (green), and observed at 790 nm, then z=(790/500)-1 ≈ 1.58.

But that's a lower redshift. So depending on the rest wavelength, the redshift varies.

Wait, but the question says "near infrared and optical spectrum"—so perhaps in the rest frame of the quasar, the emission is in the optical, but due to redshift, it's observed in the near-infrared. So perhaps the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm, and observed is 790 nm. So z= (790 /500 )-1= 0.58.

But that's a much lower redshift. So the flux drops at shorter observed wavelengths, which would mean that the rest wavelength is at 500 nm, and the drop is at shorter than 790 nm. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but if the peak is in the near-infrared (790 nm) and the flux drops below that, it could be due to the Lyman break. Because the Lyman break is a sudden drop in flux at wavelengths below the Lyman limit (91.2 nm), which when redshifted, would appear in the near-infrared.

So if the Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm, and that's observed at 790 nm, then z= (790/91.2) -1 ≈ 8.663 -1=7.663.

So z≈7.66.

So now, the comoving distance for z=7.66.

Now, let's compute the integral again with z=7.66.

Computing the integrand f(z') = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7) at various points.

Let's pick points up to z'=7.66.

Compute at z'=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.66.

z'=0: f=1.

z'=1: as before, 0.566.

z'=2: 0.3375.

z'=3:0.224.

z'=4:0.1617.

z'=5:0.1237.

z'=6: 1/sqrt(0.3*(343) +0.7) →0.3*343=102.9 +0.7=103.6 →sqrt≈10.178 →1/10.178≈0.0982.

z'=7: 0.3*(512)=153.6 +0.7=154.3 →sqrt≈12.42 →1/12.42≈0.0805.

z'=7.66: 0.3*(1+7.66)^3 = 0.3*(8.66)^3 →8.66^3= approx 8.66*8.66=75.0; 75 *8.66≈649.5 →0.3*649.5=194.85 +0.7=195.55 →sqrt(195.55)=14.0 →1/14≈0.0714.

Now, compute the integral from 0 to 7.66 using the trapezoidal rule.

Divide the interval into steps: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,4-5,5-6,6-7,7-7.66.

Compute each interval:

0-1: f(0)=1, f(1)=0.566 → Δz=1 → area= (1+0.566)/2 *1 =0.783.

1-2: f(1)=0.566, f(2)=0.3375 → (0.566+0.3375)/2 =0.45175 → area=0.45175.

2-3: (0.3375 +0.224)/2=0.28075 → area=0.28075.

3-4: (0.224 +0.1617)/2=0.19285 → area=0.19285.

4-5: (0.1617 +0.1237)/2=0.1427 → area=0.1427.

5-6: (0.1237 +0.0982)/2=0.11095 → area=0.11095.

6-7: (0.0982 +0.0805)/2=0.08935 → area=0.08935.

7-7.66: Δz=0.66.

f(7)=0.0805, f(7.66)=0.0714 → (0.0805 +0.0714)/2=0.07595 → area=0.07595 *0.66≈0.05025.

Now sum all these:

0.783 → total 0.783.

+0.45175 →1.23475.

+0.28075 →1.5155.

+0.19285 →1.70835.

+0.1427 →1.85105.

+0.11095 →1.962.

+0.08935 →2.05135.

+0.05025 →2.1016.

So the integral is approximately 2.1016.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 2.1016.

c/H0 is 4.2857 Gpc.

So 4.2857 * 2.1016 ≈ let's compute:

4 *2.1016=8.4064.

0.2857 *2.1016≈0.2857 *2=0.5714, 0.2857 *0.1016≈0.02907 → total ≈0.5714 +0.02907=0.6005.

So total≈8.4064 +0.6005=9.0069 Gpc.

So approximately 9.01 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc, which is option C.

But wait, the earlier calculation with z=5.5 gave about 8 Gpc, but with z=7.66, it's 9 Gpc.

But wait, the initial assumption about the rest wavelength determines the redshift. If the observed peak is Lyman-alpha (121 nm) redshifted to 790 nm, then z=5.5, and D_C≈8 Gpc. If the peak is the Lyman limit (91.2 nm) redshifted to 790, then z≈7.66, D_C≈9 Gpc.

But how does the peak relate to the Lyman series? The Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm. The Lyman series includes higher-order transitions, but the Lyman break is the sudden drop at around 91.2 nm due to the Lyman limit.

So if the observed peak is just below the Lyman break, the rest wavelength would be just below 91.2 nm. So the peak is observed at 790 nm, which is redshifted from, say, 80 nm. Then z=(790/80)-1=9.875-1=8.875.

Wait, but that's a very high redshift. Let me compute that.

At z=8.875, the integral would be even larger. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha line redshifted, so z= (790/121) -1≈5.528.

So D_C≈8 Gpc.

But wait, another thought: The peak in the quasar's spectrum is in the near-infrared, but the drop is below that. That's the behavior of the Lyman break. So the Lyman break is at a certain observed wavelength, say lambda_break, which is longer than the peak. So the peak is at lambda_peak=790 nm, and the drop is at lambda < lambda_peak.

So the Lyman break occurs at lambda_break = 790 nm, which is the rest frame Lyman limit (91.2 nm) redshifted. So z= (lambda_break_rest / lambda_break_observed )^{-1}.

Wait, no. The observed Lyman limit is lambda_obs = (1+z) * lambda_rest.

So lambda_rest = lambda_obs / (1+z).

If the Lyman break is at observed lambda=790 nm, then lambda_rest =91.2 nm → z= (790 /91.2 ) -1≈8.663-1=7.663.

So with z=7.663, the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc.

But if the peak is due to another emission line, then the redshift would be different.

But the question says that the peak is in the near-infrared and optical. Wait, perhaps the peak is in the rest frame optical, observed in near-infrared. For example, H-alpha is at 656 nm. If observed at 790, then z=(790/656)-1≈1.204-1=0.204. But that's a low redshift, and the comoving distance would be about 700 Mpc (using D_C formula), which is 0.7 Gpc. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, then z=5.5. So D_C≈8 Gpc.

But the question states that the flux drops below 790 nm. Which would be consistent with the Lyman break.

So if the Lyman break is at 790 nm, then z≈7.66, D_C≈9 Gpc. So the correct answer would be option C) 9 Gpc.

But earlier, another approach gave D_C≈8 Gpc at z=5.5. So which is correct?

Hmm, I think the confusion comes from whether the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line (121 nm) or the Lyman limit (91.2 nm). The question says the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. So the peak could be from the Lyman-alpha line, which is at 121 nm, redshifted to 790 nm, giving z≈5.5. Then the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, if the peak is from a higher-order Lyman series line, perhaps the redshift would be lower.

Wait, but the Lyman series lines are all below the Lyman limit. So the Lyman-alpha is the first line in the series, at 121 nm. Higher transitions (like Lyman-beta) are at even shorter wavelengths.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is longer than 121 nm, it can't be a Lyman series line. So perhaps the peak is from the Balmer series (hydrogen), which has lines in the optical. For example, H-alpha is 656 nm. If observed at 790 nm, z=(790/656) -1≈1.204−1=0.204, which is a much lower redshift. But then, why would the flux drop below 790 nm? Because perhaps other absorption features are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a different element or ionization state.

But given the confusion, perhaps the intended redshift is from the Lyman-alpha line, so z=5.5, leading to D_C≈8 Gpc.

But earlier, when considering the Lyman limit, D_C was about 9 Gpc.

So which is correct?

The question states that the peak is in the near-infrared and optical. So if the rest wavelength is in the optical (say, 500 nm), and observed at 790 nm, then z=(790/500)-1≈0.58. But that's a much lower redshift. But then, why would the flux drop at wavelengths below 790 nm? Perhaps due to the Lyman break, but that would require the quasar's rest frame to have the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm, which when observed at 790 nm implies z= (790/91.2) -1≈7.66.

So, perhaps the correct redshift is z=7.66, which would give a comoving distance of about 9 Gpc.

But this is getting really confusing. I think I'm stuck between options B (8 Gpc) and C (9 Gpc). Based on the initial calculation where the Lyman limit is observed at 790 nm, leading to z≈7.66, the comoving distance would be about 9 Gpc.

But perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc. So I'm a bit torn.

Another angle: the question asks about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is calculated using the scale factor a=1. Wait, no, comoving distance is the distance at the current time, regardless of the scale factor.

In any case, given the time I've spent, I'll go with the calculation where z=5.5 leads to D_C≈8 Gpc. So the answer would be option B)8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth, given its observed peak wavelength at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the cosmological parameters of the universe (Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), dark energy density \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7\), and a flat universe). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Identifying the Redshift**:  
   The observed peak wavelength of 790 nm is interpreted as being due to the Lyman-alpha transition (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121 \, \text{nm} \)) or the Lyman limit (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 91.2 \, \text{nm} \)).  
   - If the peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line, the redshift is calculated as:  
     \[
     z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.528
     \]
   - If the peak corresponds to the Lyman limit, the redshift is:  
     \[
     z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{91.2} - 1 \approx 7.663
     \]

2. **Calculating the Comoving Distance**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \). The term \( c/H_0 \) is approximately \( 4.285 \, \text{Gpc} \). The integral depends on the redshift \( z \) and the cosmological parameters.

   - For \( z \approx 5.528 \):  
     Using numerical integration and approximations, the integral evaluates to approximately \( 1.909 \). Thus:  
     \[
     D_C \approx 4.285 \times 1.909 \approx 8.18 \, \text{Gpc}
     \]

   - For \( z \approx 7.663 \):  
     The integral increases due to the higher redshift, evaluating to approximately \( 2.102 \). Thus:  
     \[
     D_C \approx 4.285 \times 2.102 \approx 9.01 \, \text{Gpc}
     \]

3. **Interpreting the Peak Wavelength**:  
   The flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm suggests the Lyman break, which occurs at the Lyman limit (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 91.2 \, \text{nm} \)). This implies the correct redshift is \( z \approx 7.663 \), leading to a comoving distance of approximately \( 9.01 \, \text{Gpc} \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, the comoving distance of the quasar is closest to \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \), corresponding to option C.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that quasars emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum, and their spectra can tell us a lot about the universe. The question mentions a peak in the near-infrared and optical spectrum at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. So, the peak is around 790 nm, which I think is in the near-infrared part.

Wait, I recall that when we observe a quasar, the peak of its emission could be due to various factors. One possibility is that the peak is from a Lyman break. The Lyman series is from hydrogen, and the Lyman-alpha transition is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. But if the quasar is very far away, its light gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted one.

The peak is at 790 nm. So if 790 is the observed wavelength, then the emitted wavelength would be shorter. Let me think: Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is longer, that means the source is moving away, so redshift (z) is (observed - emitted)/emitted. Wait, wait, the formula is z = (observed λ - rest λ) / rest λ, right? So z would be (790 - 121)/121 ≈ 669/121 ≈ 5.528. That's a high redshift.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance is the distance to a distant object, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance D_C is related to the redshift z. But how do I calculate D_C given the cosmological parameters?

The given cosmological parameters are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0). So these are standard Lambda-CDM parameters.

I think the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1 (since a=1 is the current scale factor). But wait, wait, no: the comoving distance is the integral from a=0 to a=1, but the actual formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1/(E(z'))] dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Because the comoving distance is calculated as the integral of the inverse of the Hubble parameter over redshift.

But wait, when integrating for comoving distance, the formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'.

So with z ≈ 5.5, and given the cosmology, I need to compute this integral. But I don't remember the exact value. Maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time or age of the universe at a certain redshift, but that might not directly give the comoving distance.

Wait, but perhaps I can refer to standard cosmology tables. I remember that for high redshifts, comoving distances are in the several Gpc range. For example, at z=1, comoving distance is about 2 Gpc, but as z increases, the comoving distance increases.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait. For example, at z=0.5, D_C is about 2 Gpc. At z=1, it's about 6 Gpc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing comoving and proper distances. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the approximate relation between redshift and comoving distance. For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance for high redshifts can be found using the formula, but without exact computation, it's tricky.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe. The age at redshift z is the integral from 0 to z (1/(E(z') (1+z')) ) dz'. But I'm not sure if that helps with the comoving distance.

Wait, another approach. The luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C. But the question is about the comoving distance, which is D_C = D_L / (1 + z).

But wait, the question says, "the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth." Wait, scale factor a=1 is now. So the comoving distance is the same as the distance now. Hmm, perhaps not—comoving distance is a way to express the distance that accounts for expansion, so it's the proper distance at the time of emission, scaled by (1+z).

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is the distance that would be measured by someone at the same time as us, but at the location of the quasar. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps another way: the peak wavelength is 790 nm, and if that corresponds to the Lyman break, then z is about (790 / 121) - 1. Wait, 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528.

Wait, let's calculate z exactly. Observed wavelength λ_obs = 790 nm, rest λ_emitted = 121 nm. So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 / 121) - 1 ≈ 6.5289 - 1 ≈ 5.5289. So z ≈ 5.53.

So the quasar is at a redshift of about 5.53. Now, the question is about comoving distance. So D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) 1/E(z') dz', where E(z') = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ ). And H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

Wait, H0 is given as 70, so c is about 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is approximately (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.285 Gpc.

So the integral part is the function of z, which for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, depends on the integrand. Let's compute the integral numerically.

Wait, but without an exact calculator, perhaps I can recall that for z=5 with Ω_m=0.3, the comoving distance is roughly around 10 Gpc. But wait, wait, I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can use some approximation methods or look up standard values. For a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance for a redshift z can be calculated with the integral.

But perhaps I can refer to an online calculator or remember some key points. Let me think. For z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc (if H0=70), but that's probably not correct. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up between H0 and the comoving distance. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so c = 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.2857 Gpc. So the comoving distance is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral.

So for z=5.5, the integral ∫0^z [1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7)} ] dz' is what I need to compute.

Let me try to approximate the integral. Since z is 5.5, which is quite high, the universe's expansion history is such that at high z, matter dominates, but dark energy becomes significant at lower z.

So the integrand 1/(sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7)).

At very high z, 0.3(1+z')^3 dominates, so the integrand ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)).

But for more accurate calculation, perhaps split the integral into two parts: from z'=0 to a point where dark energy becomes important, say z=2, and from z=2 to z=5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for high z, the comoving distance increases roughly as (1+z)^{1/2} when matter-dominated.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance can be approximated for a flat universe as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ (2/3) (1+z)^{3/2}/(sqrt(Ω_m)) ) ] for matter-dominated era, but that's only applicable when z is very high, and dark energy isn't contributing much. For lower z, dark energy starts to dominate, but at z=5.5, matter density is higher.

Wait, let's compute E(z) at various points:

At z=5.5, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+5.5)^3 +0.7) → 0.3*(6.5)^3 → 0.3*274.625≈82.3875; 82.3875 +0.7 =83.0875. So sqrt(83.0875) ≈9.115.

So at z=5.5, E(z)≈9.115, so 1/E(z)≈0.1097.

Wait, but the integral is from 0 to z. So perhaps it's better to approximate the integral by breaking it into parts where the function changes significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance for a flat universe.

Another idea: Use the formula for comoving distance as D_C = (c/H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the cosmology.

For a flat universe (Ω_r ~ 0, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), f(z) can be calculated with the integral:

∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)} ] dz'

Hmm, but without actually computing this integral, it's hard to get an exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can use a look-up table or approximate using some standard values. Let me try to think about known redshifts and their comoving distances.

I remember that for the standard cosmology (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), at z=1, D_C is approximately 2 Gpc. Wait, but earlier that seemed too low. Oh wait, perhaps that's using H0=70, so 2 Gpc would be (c/H0) * integral ≈ 4.285 Gpc * integral. So if D_C=2 Gpc, the integral would be about 0.468.

Wait, that can't be right, because for z=1, the integral would be less than 1. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing comoving distance with other distances. Let me think about a more concrete approach. Let me try to compute the integral for z=5.5 numerically.

I can approximate the integral by considering a few points.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can think of the comoving distance for high redshift. At high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so the integral would be similar to the matter-only case. Let's compute the matter-only D_C for z=5.5.

In a matter-only universe (Ω_m=1, Ω_Λ=0), E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 ) = (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integral becomes ∫0^5.5 [1/(1+z')^(3/2)] dz' = ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = [2/(1+z')] from 0 to 5.5.

So that's 2/(1+5.5) - 2/(1+0) = 2/6.5 - 2 = approx 0.3077 -2 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is:

Let u = 1 + z', so du=dz'

Integral u^(-3/2) du = (-2) u^(-1/2) + C.

So between 0 and 5.5, it's [ -2 (1/(sqrt(1+5.5)) ) ] - [ -2 (1/(sqrt(1+0)) ) ]

= -2/(sqrt(6.5)) + 2/(1)
≈ -2/(2.55) + 2 ≈ -0.784 + 2 = 1.216.

So in a matter-only universe, the integral is 1.216, so D_C= (c/H0)*1.216 ≈ (4.285 Gpc)*1.216 ≈ 5.21 Gpc.

But our universe has dark energy, so E(z) is larger at high z, meaning the integrand (1/E(z)) is smaller, so the integral would be less than 1.216. So the D_C would be less than 5.21 Gpc.

Wait, but wait: in a universe with dark energy, at high z, the matter density is higher, so E(z) is higher than in a matter-only universe. So 1/E(z) is smaller, hence the integral is smaller. So the comoving distance would be less than the matter-only case.

Hmm, but wait, in our universe, dark energy becomes dominant at lower z. At z=5.5, dark energy is not dominant because the matter density (Ω_m*(1+z)^3) is 0.3*(6.5)^3 ≈ 0.3 * 274.6 ≈ 82.38, and dark energy is 0.7, so total E(z)=sqrt(83.08)≈9.115. So it's still matter-dominated at z=5.5.

Wait, but the dark energy term is a constant, so E(z) = sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 + 0.7). So as z increases, the matter term (proportional to (1+z)^3) dominates, making E(z) larger, so the integrand 1/E(z) is smaller.

So for high z, the integral is approaching the matter-only case, but for z=5.5, it's a bit lower.

So the matter-only case gives 5.21 Gpc.

But in reality, dark energy contributes, so the integral would be slightly less than 1.216, perhaps around 1.1.

So D_C = 4.285 * 1.1 ≈ 4.71 Gpc. But wait, this is probably an underestimate because at z=5.5, the matter term is dominant, so the integral doesn't deviate too much from the matter-only case.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value.

Wait, another approach: Use the formula from the Friedmann equation to compute the comoving distance.

But without precise calculation, perhaps I can recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is around 10 Gpc. Hmm, but that seems high because in the matter-only case, z=5.5 gives about 5 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the luminosity distance. Luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C.

But the question is about comoving distance, which is D_C = D_L/(1+z).

But wait, perhaps the quasar's observed peak is due to the Lyman break. So if the Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm, and observed at 790 nm, z= (790/121) -1 ≈ 5.528.

Now, I need to find the comoving distance for this z under the given cosmology.

Wait, another thought: I found a table online once that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 is about 10 Gpc. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula.

The formula for comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'

Let me try to approximate this integral.

I can divide the integral into a few intervals and approximate each part.

Alternatively, perhaps use a table of the integral for given z. Let me think.

Wait, I found a source that for a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance for various redshifts is as follows:

z=0.5 → ≈1.66 Gpc

z=1 →≈3.37 Gpc

z=2 →≈5.43 Gpc

z=3 →≈6.67 Gpc

z=4 →≈7.24 Gpc

z=5 →≈7.54 Gpc

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense because as z increases, the comoving distance should increase. Wait, perhaps the numbers are in billions of parsecs?

Wait, no, perhaps the numbers are in units where c/H0 is about 14 billion ly, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the values.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe.

The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/(3*sqrt(Ω_m))) ) * [ ( (1 + z)^{3/2} ) / (1 + (3/2) Ω_Λ (1 + z)^{-3} ) ) ]^{-1/2} }

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use the Taylor expansion for the integrand.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral numerically.

Wait, let's compute the integrand at several points and approximate.

The integrand is f(z') = 1 / sqrt( 0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

Compute f at z'=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5.

At z'=0: 1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7) = 1/sqrt(1) =1.

z'=1: 1/sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7)= 1/sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=1/sqrt(3.1)=≈0.566.

z'=2:0.3*(27)=8.1 +0.7=8.8; sqrt(8.8)=2.966; 1/2.966≈0.3375.

z'=3:0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9; sqrt≈4.461; 1/4.461≈0.224.

z'=4:0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2 → sqrt≈6.18 → 1/6.18≈0.1617.

z'=5:0.3*216=64.8 +0.7=65.5 → sqrt≈8.09 →1/8.09≈0.1237.

z'=5.5:0.3*(6.5)^3 →6.5^3=274.625 →0.3*274.625=82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 →sqrt≈9.115 →1/9.115≈0.1097.

So now, I'll approximate the integral ∫0^5.5 f(z') dz' using the trapezoidal rule, using these points.

The trapezoidal rule estimates the integral by averaging the function at consecutive points and multiplying by the step. Let's take steps at z'=0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5.

So the intervals are from 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,4-5,5-5.5.

Compute the function at each interval midpoint for better accuracy, but perhaps for simplicity, just use the left endpoints.

Wait, no, the trapezoidal rule uses the average of endpoints for each interval.

So for each interval (z_i to z_{i+1}), the width is Δz = z_{i+1} - z_i.

The area for each interval is (f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1}))/2 * Δz.

So let's compute each interval:

Interval 0-1: Δz=1.

f(0)=1, f(1)=0.566 → area = (1 + 0.566)/2 *1 = 0.783.

Interval 1-2: Δz=1.

f(1)=0.566, f(2)=0.3375 → (0.566 +0.3375)/2 *1 = 0.45175.

Interval 2-3: Δz=1.

f(2)=0.3375, f(3)=0.224 → (0.3375 +0.224)/2 = 0.28075 → area=0.28075.

Interval 3-4: Δz=1.

f(3)=0.224, f(4)=0.1617 → (0.224 +0.1617)/2=0.19285 → area=0.19285.

Interval 4-5: Δz=1.

f(4)=0.1617, f(5)=0.1237 → (0.1617 +0.1237)/2=0.1427 → area=0.1427.

Interval 5-5.5: Δz=0.5.

f(5)=0.1237, f(5.5)=0.1097 → (0.1237 + 0.1097)/2=0.1167 → area=0.1167 * 0.5 = 0.05835.

Now sum all these areas:

0.783 + 0.45175 = 1.23475

+0.28075 →1.5155

+0.19285 →1.70835

+0.1427 →1.85105

+0.05835 →1.9094.

So the approximate integral is about 1.9094.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 1.9094.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5) /70 →≈4285.7 Mpc →≈4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C ≈4.2857 Gpc * 1.9094 ≈ let's compute:

4.2857 * 1.9094.

Let me compute 4 *1.9094=7.6376, 0.2857*1.9094≈0.2857*1.9=0.5428, so total≈7.6376 + 0.5428=8.1804 Gpc.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 4.2857 *1.9094.

Breaking it down: 4 *1.9094 = 7.6376.

0.2857 *1.9094 ≈ 0.2857 * 1.9094.

0.2857 *1 =0.2857; 0.2857 * 0.9094≈0.2607. So total ≈0.2857 +0.2607=0.5464.

So total D_C ≈7.6376 +0.5464=8.184 Gpc.

So approximately 8.18 Gpc.

Looking back at the options, the choices are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So 8.18 is closest to 8 Gpc. But wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So option B is 8 Gpc.

But wait, wait. Another thing to consider: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared, which is close to the Lyman break. So redshift z≈5.5. But in reality, the Lyman break is around 912 Angstroms, which is 91.2 nm. Wait, no, wait: Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, but the Lyman series emission can be broader. Wait, but the Lyman break is the wavelength beyond which the transmitted flux drops because of hydrogen absorption. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, the Lyman break would be at longer wavelengths (since higher z would redshift it more).

Wait, no. Wait, the Lyman break is the point where the transmitted flux drops due to the Lyman-alpha forest. So for a quasar at high redshift, the observed Lyman break would be in the near-infrared.

Wait, but the peak at 790 nm is the rest-frame wavelength? Or the observed?

Wait, the question says the peak is observed in the near-infrared and optical. So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So if the peak is from the Lyman series, then the rest wavelength is shorter. So for example, if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then z= (790/121)-1≈5.528.

But if the rest wavelength is longer, like from another line, then the redshift would be lower.

Wait, but the question states that the flux drops at wavelengths below 790 nm. So that suggests that the peak is at 790 and the drop is below, which would be consistent with the Lyman break. So the Lyman break occurs at 790 nm observed, which would correspond to the rest frame at shorter wavelength. So the Lyman break at 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm) would be redshifted to 790 nm: z = (790 /91.2 ) -1 ≈ 8.663 -1 =7.663.

Wait, that's a different z. So I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91.2 nm. So if the Lyman break is observed at 790 nm, then the quasar's rest frame Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm, so z = (790 /91.2 ) -1.

Let me compute that:

790 /91.2 ≈8.663 → z≈7.663.

That's a higher redshift than I previously thought. So z≈7.66.

So the redshift is higher, about 7.66.

So now, reevaluating the comoving distance with z=7.66.

Hmm, that's a higher redshift. So let's recalculate the integral.

But wait, this depends on whether the peak is the Lyman-alpha line or the Lyman limit. The peak at 790 nm could be the Lyman-alpha line (121 nm) redshifted, but if it's the Lyman limit (91.2 nm), then the redshift is higher.

Wait, the question says "a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly." That's the behavior of the Lyman break. The Lyman break is the point where the transmitted flux drops because of absorption by hydrogen. So the peak in the spectrum would be just blueward of the break, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the rest-frame optical, but observed in near-infrared. So if the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm (green), and observed at 790 nm, then z=(790/500)-1 ≈ 1.58.

But that's a lower redshift. So depending on the rest wavelength, the redshift varies.

Wait, but the question says "near infrared and optical spectrum"—so perhaps in the rest frame of the quasar, the emission is in the optical, but due to redshift, it's observed in the near-infrared. So perhaps the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm, and observed is 790 nm. So z= (790 /500 )-1= 0.58.

But that's a much lower redshift. So the flux drops at shorter observed wavelengths, which would mean that the rest wavelength is at 500 nm, and the drop is at shorter than 790 nm. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but if the peak is in the near-infrared (790 nm) and the flux drops below that, it could be due to the Lyman break. Because the Lyman break is a sudden drop in flux at wavelengths below the Lyman limit (91.2 nm), which when redshifted, would appear in the near-infrared.

So if the Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm, and that's observed at 790 nm, then z= (790/91.2) -1 ≈ 8.663 -1=7.663.

So z≈7.66.

So now, the comoving distance for z=7.66.

Now, let's compute the integral again with z=7.66.

Computing the integrand f(z') = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7) at various points.

Let's pick points up to z'=7.66.

Compute at z'=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.66.

z'=0: f=1.

z'=1: as before, 0.566.

z'=2: 0.3375.

z'=3:0.224.

z'=4:0.1617.

z'=5:0.1237.

z'=6: 1/sqrt(0.3*(343) +0.7) →0.3*343=102.9 +0.7=103.6 →sqrt≈10.178 →1/10.178≈0.0982.

z'=7: 0.3*(512)=153.6 +0.7=154.3 →sqrt≈12.42 →1/12.42≈0.0805.

z'=7.66: 0.3*(1+7.66)^3 = 0.3*(8.66)^3 →8.66^3= approx 8.66*8.66=75.0; 75 *8.66≈649.5 →0.3*649.5=194.85 +0.7=195.55 →sqrt(195.55)=14.0 →1/14≈0.0714.

Now, compute the integral from 0 to 7.66 using the trapezoidal rule.

Divide the interval into steps: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,4-5,5-6,6-7,7-7.66.

Compute each interval:

0-1: f(0)=1, f(1)=0.566 → Δz=1 → area= (1+0.566)/2 *1 =0.783.

1-2: f(1)=0.566, f(2)=0.3375 → (0.566+0.3375)/2 =0.45175 → area=0.45175.

2-3: (0.3375 +0.224)/2=0.28075 → area=0.28075.

3-4: (0.224 +0.1617)/2=0.19285 → area=0.19285.

4-5: (0.1617 +0.1237)/2=0.1427 → area=0.1427.

5-6: (0.1237 +0.0982)/2=0.11095 → area=0.11095.

6-7: (0.0982 +0.0805)/2=0.08935 → area=0.08935.

7-7.66: Δz=0.66.

f(7)=0.0805, f(7.66)=0.0714 → (0.0805 +0.0714)/2=0.07595 → area=0.07595 *0.66≈0.05025.

Now sum all these:

0.783 → total 0.783.

+0.45175 →1.23475.

+0.28075 →1.5155.

+0.19285 →1.70835.

+0.1427 →1.85105.

+0.11095 →1.962.

+0.08935 →2.05135.

+0.05025 →2.1016.

So the integral is approximately 2.1016.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 2.1016.

c/H0 is 4.2857 Gpc.

So 4.2857 * 2.1016 ≈ let's compute:

4 *2.1016=8.4064.

0.2857 *2.1016≈0.2857 *2=0.5714, 0.2857 *0.1016≈0.02907 → total ≈0.5714 +0.02907=0.6005.

So total≈8.4064 +0.6005=9.0069 Gpc.

So approximately 9.01 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc, which is option C.

But wait, the earlier calculation with z=5.5 gave about 8 Gpc, but with z=7.66, it's 9 Gpc.

But wait, the initial assumption about the rest wavelength determines the redshift. If the observed peak is Lyman-alpha (121 nm) redshifted to 790 nm, then z=5.5, and D_C≈8 Gpc. If the peak is the Lyman limit (91.2 nm) redshifted to 790, then z≈7.66, D_C≈9 Gpc.

But how does the peak relate to the Lyman series? The Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm. The Lyman series includes higher-order transitions, but the Lyman break is the sudden drop at around 91.2 nm due to the Lyman limit.

So if the observed peak is just below the Lyman break, the rest wavelength would be just below 91.2 nm. So the peak is observed at 790 nm, which is redshifted from, say, 80 nm. Then z=(790/80)-1=9.875-1=8.875.

Wait, but that's a very high redshift. Let me compute that.

At z=8.875, the integral would be even larger. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha line redshifted, so z= (790/121) -1≈5.528.

So D_C≈8 Gpc.

But wait, another thought: The peak in the quasar's spectrum is in the near-infrared, but the drop is below that. That's the behavior of the Lyman break. So the Lyman break is at a certain observed wavelength, say lambda_break, which is longer than the peak. So the peak is at lambda_peak=790 nm, and the drop is at lambda < lambda_peak.

So the Lyman break occurs at lambda_break = 790 nm, which is the rest frame Lyman limit (91.2 nm) redshifted. So z= (lambda_break_rest / lambda_break_observed )^{-1}.

Wait, no. The observed Lyman limit is lambda_obs = (1+z) * lambda_rest.

So lambda_rest = lambda_obs / (1+z).

If the Lyman break is at observed lambda=790 nm, then lambda_rest =91.2 nm → z= (790 /91.2 ) -1≈8.663-1=7.663.

So with z=7.663, the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc.

But if the peak is due to another emission line, then the redshift would be different.

But the question says that the peak is in the near-infrared and optical. Wait, perhaps the peak is in the rest frame optical, observed in near-infrared. For example, H-alpha is at 656 nm. If observed at 790, then z=(790/656)-1≈1.204-1=0.204. But that's a low redshift, and the comoving distance would be about 700 Mpc (using D_C formula), which is 0.7 Gpc. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, then z=5.5. So D_C≈8 Gpc.

But the question states that the flux drops below 790 nm. Which would be consistent with the Lyman break.

So if the Lyman break is at 790 nm, then z≈7.66, D_C≈9 Gpc. So the correct answer would be option C) 9 Gpc.

But earlier, another approach gave D_C≈8 Gpc at z=5.5. So which is correct?

Hmm, I think the confusion comes from whether the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line (121 nm) or the Lyman limit (91.2 nm). The question says the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. So the peak could be from the Lyman-alpha line, which is at 121 nm, redshifted to 790 nm, giving z≈5.5. Then the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, if the peak is from a higher-order Lyman series line, perhaps the redshift would be lower.

Wait, but the Lyman series lines are all below the Lyman limit. So the Lyman-alpha is the first line in the series, at 121 nm. Higher transitions (like Lyman-beta) are at even shorter wavelengths.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is longer than 121 nm, it can't be a Lyman series line. So perhaps the peak is from the Balmer series (hydrogen), which has lines in the optical. For example, H-alpha is 656 nm. If observed at 790 nm, z=(790/656) -1≈1.204−1=0.204, which is a much lower redshift. But then, why would the flux drop below 790 nm? Because perhaps other absorption features are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a different element or ionization state.

But given the confusion, perhaps the intended redshift is from the Lyman-alpha line, so z=5.5, leading to D_C≈8 Gpc.

But earlier, when considering the Lyman limit, D_C was about 9 Gpc.

So which is correct?

The question states that the peak is in the near-infrared and optical. So if the rest wavelength is in the optical (say, 500 nm), and observed at 790 nm, then z=(790/500)-1≈0.58. But that's a much lower redshift. But then, why would the flux drop at wavelengths below 790 nm? Perhaps due to the Lyman break, but that would require the quasar's rest frame to have the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm, which when observed at 790 nm implies z= (790/91.2) -1≈7.66.

So, perhaps the correct redshift is z=7.66, which would give a comoving distance of about 9 Gpc.

But this is getting really confusing. I think I'm stuck between options B (8 Gpc) and C (9 Gpc). Based on the initial calculation where the Lyman limit is observed at 790 nm, leading to z≈7.66, the comoving distance would be about 9 Gpc.

But perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc. So I'm a bit torn.

Another angle: the question asks about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is calculated using the scale factor a=1. Wait, no, comoving distance is the distance at the current time, regardless of the scale factor.

In any case, given the time I've spent, I'll go with the calculation where z=5.5 leads to D_C≈8 Gpc. So the answer would be option B)8 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth, given its observed peak wavelength at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the cosmological parameters of the universe (Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), dark energy density \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7\), and a flat universe). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Identifying the Redshift**:  
   The observed peak wavelength of 790 nm is interpreted as being due to the Lyman-alpha transition (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121 \, \text{nm} \)) or the Lyman limit (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 91.2 \, \text{nm} \)).  
   - If the peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line, the redshift is calculated as:  
     \[
     z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.528
     \]
   - If the peak corresponds to the Lyman limit, the redshift is:  
     \[
     z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{91.2} - 1 \approx 7.663
     \]

2. **Calculating the Comoving Distance**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \). The term \( c/H_0 \) is approximately \( 4.285 \, \text{Gpc} \). The integral depends on the redshift \( z \) and the cosmological parameters.

   - For \( z \approx 5.528 \):  
     Using numerical integration and approximations, the integral evaluates to approximately \( 1.909 \). Thus:  
     \[
     D_C \approx 4.285 \times 1.909 \approx 8.18 \, \text{Gpc}
     \]

   - For \( z \approx 7.663 \):  
     The integral increases due to the higher redshift, evaluating to approximately \( 2.102 \). Thus:  
     \[
     D_C \approx 4.285 \times 2.102 \approx 9.01 \, \text{Gpc}
     \]

3. **Interpreting the Peak Wavelength**:  
   The flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm suggests the Lyman break, which occurs at the Lyman limit (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 91.2 \, \text{nm} \)). This implies the correct redshift is \( z \approx 7.663 \), leading to a comoving distance of approximately \( 9.01 \, \text{Gpc} \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, the comoving distance of the quasar is closest to \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \), corresponding to option C.

**Answer: C**
