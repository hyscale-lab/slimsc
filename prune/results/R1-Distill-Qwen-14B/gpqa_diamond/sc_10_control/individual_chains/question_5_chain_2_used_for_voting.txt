Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvalues and eigenvectors can get a little tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues correspond to their components along a particular direction.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I think each component should correspond to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So for example, P_x would be (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly σx multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly for P_y and P_z.

Right, so the operator P is a vector operator, and its components are given. So the operator we're interested in is the component along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which means it can be written as having angles θ and φ where φ is 0 because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, wait. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction can have components in x and z but not y. So the vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, but probably in this case, φ is zero. Or wait, maybe the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector is along x-z, so the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle.

So the operator P·n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n_y is zero, that term disappears.

So substituting the expressions for P_x, P_y, P_z:

P·n = (ħ/2) [n_x σx + n_z σz]

Wait, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So it's (ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ]

Now, the σx and σz matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So putting it all together:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)(cosθ), (1,2) is (ħ/2)(sinθ), (2,1) is (ħ/2)(sinθ), and (2,2) is (ħ/2)(-cosθ).

So matrix form:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   (-ħ/2 cosθ) ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ] [a]   = (ħ/2) [a]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   (-ħ/2 cosθ) ] [b]      [b]

Let me divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ cosθ    sinθ ] [a]   = [a]
[ sinθ   -cosθ ] [b]     [b]

So the equations become:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange these equations.

From the first equation:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
=> (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

From the second equation:

sinθ a - cosθ b = b  
=> sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Hmm, these are two equations which we can write as:

( (cosθ - 1) ) a + ( sinθ ) b = 0  
( sinθ ) a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Wait, but since the system is homogeneous, we can find a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero) if the determinant is zero. Let's compute the determinant of the coefficients matrix.

The determinant is:

| (cosθ -1)   sinθ      |
|  sinθ     (-cosθ -1) |

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)
= [ -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) -1*(cosθ +1) ) ] - sin²θ
Wait, maybe expanding it step by step:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2

Multiply out the first term:
= [ (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1) ) ]
= (-cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1)
Simplify: -cos²θ + 1.

So D = (-cos²θ +1 ) - sin²θ.

Wait, but sin²θ is 1 - cos²θ. So:

D = (1 - cos²θ) - (1 - cos²θ) = 0.

Oh, so the determinant is zero. So the system is dependent, and we can find a non-trivial solution.

Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can write this as (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b.

So,

b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a.

Hmm, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2), right? Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So b = tan(theta/2) a.

So the ratio is b = [ tan(theta/2) ] a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ a, tan(theta/2) a ].

We can choose a = 1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

So the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

Wait, but to make it a unit vector, the norm should be sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = sqrt( sec²(theta/2) ) = |sec(theta/2)|. So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the vector [1, tan(theta/2)] can be written as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/cos(theta/2).

Wait, let me think. Let me take the vector as [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me compute the normalization. The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

But wait, let me check. Suppose a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). Then, [a; b] is the normalized eigenvector.

So that would mean the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D) has square roots and more terms. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The eigenvector we found is [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is of the form (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C matches this.

But wait, the question gives the operator as P, which is along an arbitrary direction in x-z. So the eigenvector would depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis, since the direction is in x-z.

So the eigenvector components would be functions of theta, as in option C.

But wait, let me think about possible phases. Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a global phase, but in this case, the problem says to find the normalized eigenvector, so the phase is determined. The question includes an 'e^{i phi}' in option B, but since the direction is in x-z, phi is zero, so the phase shouldn't matter. But I'm not sure if the problem's eigenvector requires a specific form.

Wait, in the problem, the operator is P along direction n. The eigenvalue is positive ħ/2, which is the maximum eigenvalue for spin-1/2 systems, so the eigenvector should correspond to spin-up along that direction.

So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for S·n are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is zero because the direction is in x-z. So phi = 0. So the components would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because e^{i 0} is 1, so the second component is sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So that's the correct answer.

But wait, looking back at the structure of the problem. The operator is P, which is the same as the spin operator S scaled by ħ, because S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the operator P here is (I think) representing the spin operator multiplied by ħ.

Wait, no, looking at the components, each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So P = ħ/2 * σ for each component, so P is the spin operator S scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the spin operator S has components Sx = ħ/2 σx, Sy = ħ/2 σy, Sz = ħ/2 σz. So yes, P is the spin operator.

So the eigenvalue for S·n when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 (since P·n = (ħ/2)(n·σ)).

Wait, no, because the operator P·n is (ħ/2)(n·σ), which has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2).

So when we're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2, the state is the same as the spin-up state along n. Which, in spherical coordinates, is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But since the direction is in x-z, phi is 0, so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is exactly option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equations simplify to:

\[
\begin{cases}
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \\
\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\end{cases}
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1) a + \sin\theta \, b = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (1 - \cos\theta) a = \sin\theta \, b.
\]

This gives the ratio:

\[
b = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} a = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor:

\[
\sqrt{1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \sqrt{\sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- Option B includes a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, but since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so this term is not relevant.
- Option D introduces additional square root factors that are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvalues and eigenvectors can get a little tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues correspond to their components along a particular direction.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I think each component should correspond to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So for example, P_x would be (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly σx multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly for P_y and P_z.

Right, so the operator P is a vector operator, and its components are given. So the operator we're interested in is the component along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which means it can be written as having angles θ and φ where φ is 0 because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, wait. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction can have components in x and z but not y. So the vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, but probably in this case, φ is zero. Or wait, maybe the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector is along x-z, so the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle.

So the operator P·n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n_y is zero, that term disappears.

So substituting the expressions for P_x, P_y, P_z:

P·n = (ħ/2) [n_x σx + n_z σz]

Wait, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So it's (ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ]

Now, the σx and σz matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So putting it all together:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)(cosθ), (1,2) is (ħ/2)(sinθ), (2,1) is (ħ/2)(sinθ), and (2,2) is (ħ/2)(-cosθ).

So matrix form:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   (-ħ/2 cosθ) ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ] [a]   = (ħ/2) [a]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   (-ħ/2 cosθ) ] [b]      [b]

Let me divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ cosθ    sinθ ] [a]   = [a]
[ sinθ   -cosθ ] [b]     [b]

So the equations become:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange these equations.

From the first equation:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
=> (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

From the second equation:

sinθ a - cosθ b = b  
=> sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Hmm, these are two equations which we can write as:

( (cosθ - 1) ) a + ( sinθ ) b = 0  
( sinθ ) a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Wait, but since the system is homogeneous, we can find a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero) if the determinant is zero. Let's compute the determinant of the coefficients matrix.

The determinant is:

| (cosθ -1)   sinθ      |
|  sinθ     (-cosθ -1) |

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)
= [ -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) -1*(cosθ +1) ) ] - sin²θ
Wait, maybe expanding it step by step:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2

Multiply out the first term:
= [ (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1) ) ]
= (-cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1)
Simplify: -cos²θ + 1.

So D = (-cos²θ +1 ) - sin²θ.

Wait, but sin²θ is 1 - cos²θ. So:

D = (1 - cos²θ) - (1 - cos²θ) = 0.

Oh, so the determinant is zero. So the system is dependent, and we can find a non-trivial solution.

Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can write this as (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b.

So,

b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a.

Hmm, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2), right? Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So b = tan(theta/2) a.

So the ratio is b = [ tan(theta/2) ] a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ a, tan(theta/2) a ].

We can choose a = 1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

So the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

Wait, but to make it a unit vector, the norm should be sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = sqrt( sec²(theta/2) ) = |sec(theta/2)|. So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the vector [1, tan(theta/2)] can be written as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/cos(theta/2).

Wait, let me think. Let me take the vector as [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me compute the normalization. The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

But wait, let me check. Suppose a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). Then, [a; b] is the normalized eigenvector.

So that would mean the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D) has square roots and more terms. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The eigenvector we found is [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is of the form (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C matches this.

But wait, the question gives the operator as P, which is along an arbitrary direction in x-z. So the eigenvector would depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis, since the direction is in x-z.

So the eigenvector components would be functions of theta, as in option C.

But wait, let me think about possible phases. Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a global phase, but in this case, the problem says to find the normalized eigenvector, so the phase is determined. The question includes an 'e^{i phi}' in option B, but since the direction is in x-z, phi is zero, so the phase shouldn't matter. But I'm not sure if the problem's eigenvector requires a specific form.

Wait, in the problem, the operator is P along direction n. The eigenvalue is positive ħ/2, which is the maximum eigenvalue for spin-1/2 systems, so the eigenvector should correspond to spin-up along that direction.

So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for S·n are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is zero because the direction is in x-z. So phi = 0. So the components would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because e^{i 0} is 1, so the second component is sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So that's the correct answer.

But wait, looking back at the structure of the problem. The operator is P, which is the same as the spin operator S scaled by ħ, because S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the operator P here is (I think) representing the spin operator multiplied by ħ.

Wait, no, looking at the components, each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So P = ħ/2 * σ for each component, so P is the spin operator S scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the spin operator S has components Sx = ħ/2 σx, Sy = ħ/2 σy, Sz = ħ/2 σz. So yes, P is the spin operator.

So the eigenvalue for S·n when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 (since P·n = (ħ/2)(n·σ)).

Wait, no, because the operator P·n is (ħ/2)(n·σ), which has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2).

So when we're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2, the state is the same as the spin-up state along n. Which, in spherical coordinates, is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But since the direction is in x-z, phi is 0, so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is exactly option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equations simplify to:

\[
\begin{cases}
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \\
\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\end{cases}
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1) a + \sin\theta \, b = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (1 - \cos\theta) a = \sin\theta \, b.
\]

This gives the ratio:

\[
b = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} a = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor:

\[
\sqrt{1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \sqrt{\sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- Option B includes a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, but since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so this term is not relevant.
- Option D introduces additional square root factors that are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
