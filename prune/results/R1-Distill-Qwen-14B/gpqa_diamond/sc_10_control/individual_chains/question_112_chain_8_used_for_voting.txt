Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question talks about probabilities, which depend on the state being normalized.

Wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, right? So they form an orthonormal basis. That's good because I can work in that basis.

The first part of the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about what such a matrix would look like.

For a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems, I think), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[0     hbar/2
 hbar/2 0 ]

That's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. What operator does this represent? Oh wait, that's similar to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But the given matrix isn't any of those directly.

Wait, if the operator's matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then perhaps it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal. So operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, when you do a measurement, the eigenstates of the operator are what you measure. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. But wait, sigma_x's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator A. Because the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize operator A and express |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates, then find the probabilities.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think. The operator A has eigenvalues ± (hbar/2), because the eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so A= (hbar/2) sigma_x would have eigenvalues ± hbar/2.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the eigenstates of A. Let me try that. The matrix for A is:

[0      hbar/2
hbar/2  0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So det[ [-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ] ] = 0.

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) =0. So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ= ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are indeed plus and minus hbar/2.

The eigenstates can be found for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = hbar/2.

The equation (A - (hbar/2)I)|v> = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[-hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to:

Row 1: (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2.

Matrix:

[hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute. A - (-hbar/2) I is:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2    hbar/2 ]

Which gives equations like (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) and (1,1), up to normalization.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, |up> corresponds to basis vector (1,0), |down> to (0,1). So in terms of the eigenstates, we have |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

But wait, wait! Let me confirm. For the first eigenvalue, λ = hbar/2, the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1), so the state would be (1,1). But in terms of |up> and |down>, that's |up> + |down>. But we need to normalize, so divide by sqrt(2), so |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and similarly for the other eigenvalue.

Wait, but when λ is hbar/2, the eigenvector is (1,1), which corresponds to |up> + |down>. Similarly, when λ is -hbar/2, the eigenvector is (1,-1), which is |up> - |down>. So yes, that's correct.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. But first, I think I should normalize |alpha>.

So let's compute the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The squared norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total squared norm is 2 +5=7.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha>= (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Let me express |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + c_- [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

Combine terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_- )/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>.

But we also have |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7 )

( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7 )

So we have a system of two equations:

1. (c_+ + c_-) = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) → (1 + i) sqrt(7/2 )

Wait, let's write them as:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = [ (1 + i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) ) → (1 + i) sqrt(2/7 )

Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = [ (2 - i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) ) → (2 - i) sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write these as:

(c_+ + c_- ) = [ (1 + i) ] * (1/sqrt(7) ) * sqrt(2) )

Similarly for the other equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the components.

Let me write the two equations:

c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7 )

c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2 ) → (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7 )

So I can add and subtract these equations to find c_+ and c_-.

Adding the two equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So 2 c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2/7 )

→ c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Compute numerator: 1 -2 = -1, i +i = 2i → (-1 + 2i )

So 2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7 )

→ c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute c_+ and c_- using these expressions. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+> and |->.

Alternatively, since |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the inner product < + | alpha > would give the amplitude for |+> in |alpha>.

So compute < + | alpha >.

< + | = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2 )

So < + | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/ sqrt(2) ) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/ sqrt(2) )

Because < up | up > is 1, < up | down > is 0, and same for < down | up >.

So that becomes (1 + i + 2 - i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3 / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3 / sqrt(14 )

Similarly, the amplitude for |-> is < - | alpha >, which is:

< - | = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2 )

So < - | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) - [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1-2= -1, i +i = 2i → (-1 + 2i )

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes.

Compute | < + | alpha > |^2.

Which is (3)^2 / (14 ) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, | < - | alpha > |^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (14 )

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2 → (-1)^2 + (2)^2 → 1 +4=5 → 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is approx 0.3571. Let me check the sum: 9+5=14, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately.

But let me make sure.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. But 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is approximately 0.64, so that's close. The other option is 0.36, which is 5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the first part of the question is about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that matches option A.

Now, the second part is the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is <alpha| A | alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, and |alpha> is a state, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, the operator's eigenvalues are ± hbar/2. So the expectation value is (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(- hbar/2 )

Compute that.

= [9/14 * (hbar/2) ] - [5/14 * (hbar/2) ]

= [ (9 -5) / (14 * 2 ) ] hbar
= (4 / 28 ) hbar
= (1/7) hbar.

So <A> = hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and5/14, average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The squared norm is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates:

\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these overlaps:

\[
P(+\rangle) = \left| \langle +|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = \left| \langle -|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using the fact that \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

Wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, right? So they form an orthonormal basis. That's good because I can work in that basis.

The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about what such a matrix would look like.

For a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems, I think), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[0     hbar/2
 hbar/2 0 ]

That's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. What operator does this represent? Oh wait, that's similar to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But the given matrix isn't any of those directly.

Wait, if the operator's matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then perhaps it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal. So operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, when you do a measurement, the eigenstates of the operator are what you measure. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. But wait, sigma_x's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator A. Because the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize operator A and express |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates, then find the probabilities.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think. The operator A has eigenvalues ± (hbar/2), because the eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so A= (hbar/2) sigma_x would have eigenvalues ± hbar/2.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the eigenstates of A. Let me try that. The matrix for A is:

[0      hbar/2
hbar/2  0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So det[ [-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ] ] = 0.

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) =0. So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ= ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are indeed plus and minus hbar/2.

The eigenstates can be found for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = hbar/2.

The equation (A - (hbar/2)I)|v> = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[-hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to:

Row 1: (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2.

Matrix:

[hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute. A - (-hbar/2) I is:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2
 hbar/2    hbar/2 ]

Which gives equations like (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) and (1,1), up to normalization.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, |up> corresponds to basis vector (1,0), |down> to (0,1). So in terms of the eigenstates, we have |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

But wait, wait! Let me confirm. For the first eigenvalue, λ = hbar/2, the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1), so the state would be (1,1). But in terms of |up> and |down>, that's |up> + |down>. But we need to normalize, so divide by sqrt(2), so |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and similarly for the other eigenvalue.

Wait, but when λ is hbar/2, the eigenvector is (1,1), which corresponds to |up> + |down>. Similarly, when λ is -hbar/2, the eigenvector is (1,-1), which is |up> - |down>. So yes, that's correct.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. But first, I think I should normalize |alpha>.

So let's compute the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The squared norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total squared norm is 2 +5=7.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha>= (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Let me express |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + c_- [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

Combine terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_- )/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>.

But we also have |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7 )

( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7 )

So we have a system of two equations:

1. (c_+ + c_-) = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) → (1 + i) sqrt(7/2 )

Wait, let's write them as:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = [ (1 + i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) ) → (1 + i) sqrt(2/7 )

Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = [ (2 - i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) ) → (2 - i) sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write these as:

(c_+ + c_- ) = [ (1 + i) ] * (1/sqrt(7) ) * sqrt(2) )

Similarly for the other equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the components.

Let me write the two equations:

c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7 )

c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2 ) → (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7 )

So I can add and subtract these equations to find c_+ and c_-.

Adding the two equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So 2 c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2/7 )

→ c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Compute numerator: 1 -2 = -1, i +i = 2i → (-1 + 2i )

So 2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7 )

→ c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute c_+ and c_- using these expressions. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+> and |->.

Alternatively, since |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the inner product < + | alpha > would give the amplitude for |+> in |alpha>.

So compute < + | alpha >.

< + | = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2 )

So < + | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/ sqrt(2) ) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/ sqrt(2) )

Because < up | up > is 1, < up | down > is 0, and same for < down | up >.

So that becomes (1 + i + 2 - i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3 / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3 / sqrt(14 )

Similarly, the amplitude for |-> is < - | alpha >, which is:

< - | = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2 )

So < - | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) - [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1-2= -1, i +i = 2i → (-1 + 2i )

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes.

Compute | < + | alpha > |^2.

Which is (3)^2 / (14 ) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, | < - | alpha > |^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (14 )

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2 → (-1)^2 + (2)^2 → 1 +4=5 → 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is approx 0.3571. Let me check the sum: 9+5=14, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately.

But let me make sure.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. But 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is approximately 0.64, so that's close. The other option is 0.36, which is 5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the first part of the question is about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that matches option A.

Now, the second part is the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is <alpha| A | alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, and |alpha> is a state, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, the operator's eigenvalues are ± hbar/2. So the expectation value is (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(- hbar/2 )

Compute that.

= [9/14 * (hbar/2) ] - [5/14 * (hbar/2) ]

= [ (9 -5) / (14 * 2 ) ] hbar
= (4 / 28 ) hbar
= (1/7) hbar.

So <A> = hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and5/14, average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The squared norm is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates:

\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these overlaps:

\[
P(+\rangle) = \left| \langle +|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = \left| \langle -|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using the fact that \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
