Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, okay, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the bonding arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same bonding but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let's take them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a connectivity, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the molecule must have both a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen. Oh right, so if a compound can't undergo such a shift, it doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think that's a cyclic quinone. Quinones are cyclic di-ketones. Benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups, maybe in the para positions. So structure would be O=C6H4-C=O. So two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's a cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups, equally spaced. So each O is on a carbon, and the ring has alternating single and double bonds? Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered single-bonded ring. Trione means three ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, I think, but arranged in a ring. So the carbonyl groups are at every other carbon.

Now, tautomerism: for that, the compound needs a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's see:

Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Are the hydrogens on the adjacent carbons? Let's see: the carbonyl is on the benzene ring. So each ketone is attached to a benzene carbon. The adjacent carbons are the other benzene carbons. So, for example, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So each carbon with the carbonyl is attached to two other carbons in the ring. Are those adjacent carbons bearing hydrogens?

Wait, in benzene rings, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's a mono-substituted ring, but in benzoquinone, which is a di-substituted ring (two ketones), each ring carbon is connected to other ring carbons. So the carbonyl carbons are bonded to two other ring carbons. The ring carbons next to the carbonyl groups don't have any hydrogens attached because they're all part of the aromatic ring. So does benzoquinone have any alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups)?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Benzene is a ring of six carbons each with one H when it's a mono-substituted. But in benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring where two of the carbons are carbonyls. So the structure is, I think, O=C-C6H2-C=O. Wait, no, more like two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. The adjacent carbons are also benzene carbons. So do those have hydrogens? Benzene is a planar structure with each carbon bonded to one hydrogen, except when substituted. So in benzoquinone, the carbons next to the ketones are part of the ring and each is bonded to a hydrogen. Oh wait, no. Let me think about the structure of para-benzoquinone. It's two ketone groups on opposite carbons of the benzene ring. So the ring has six carbons, two of which are carbonyl groups. The other four are each connected to a hydrogen. So the carbonyl groups are each attached to a carbon that is next to two other carbons (in the ring), but those adjacent carbons (the ones next to the ketones) are each connected to a hydrogen. So, yes, they have alpha hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, so it should be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that in aromatic systems, the conjugation might prevent certain tautomerism. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of alpha hydrogens is all that's needed. So if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize. But wait, in the case of quinones, I'm not sure if tautomerism is possible because the ring is already conjugated. Let me think. For example, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has an alpha hydrogen. But for something like benzophenone, it's also possible. Wait, but in some cases, tautomerism may not be observed if the structure is too rigid or if the transition state is not favorable. Maybe in some quinones, the structure is such that enol form isn't possible.

Hmm, maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if you have three carbonyl groups in cyclohexane, the ring would probably have to be quite strained. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring with three ketone groups in a conjugated system, like 1,3,5-tricarbonyl cyclohexane. So, each carbonyl is at every other position. Let me imagine the structure: each of the three carbonyls is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to another carbonyl. Wait, but that might make the molecule have conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds only, but if you have three carbonyls, perhaps the ring is actually a cyclohexene with three ketones?

Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic structure. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the tautomerism part. If this trione has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is adjacent to other carbonyls. So the carbons next to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens on them?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be O=C-C-O-C-C-O in a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is connected to another carbonyl. Wait, that can't be right because that would require each carbon to have two carbonyl groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Maybe it's a ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl, and the others are CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have carbonyl groups on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is a six-membered ring where three alternate carbons are carbonyls. So between each carbonyl is a CH2 group. So the structure is O=C-CH2-C=O-CH2-C=O in a ring. Wait, but that would require the ring to have single bonds only. So each carbonyl is at positions 1, 3, 5, and each is connected by CH2 groups.

In this structure, each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to a CH2 group. So the CH2 groups are adjacent to the carbonyls. So the CH2 groups have hydrogens, which are alpha hydrogens. So, yes, this compound has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyls. So it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric and the carbonyls are separated by CH2 groups, then perhaps each has alpha hydrogens. So both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. So both can undergo tautomerism.

But that can't be right because the question says one does not show tautomerism. So perhaps one of them doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Let me think again.

Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The adjacent carbons are each part of the benzene ring, right? Each of those adjacent carbons is bonded to two other carbons in the ring, so maybe they don't have any hydrogens attached. Wait, no, each carbon in the benzene ring (apart from the two substituted with carbonyls) has a hydrogen. So for benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene carbons, each of which is adjacent to two other benzene carbons, each of which has a hydrogen. So in that case, the carbonyl carbons are attached to benzene carbons that have adjacent hydrogens. So, yes, alpha hydrogens are present.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are conjugated with the benzene ring, making the adjacent positions part of an aromatic system. So the adjacent carbons are sp2 hybridized, so they don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's a mono-substituted, but in a di-substituted ring, the adjacent carbons may not have hydrogens. Let me think: in para-benzoquinone, the structure is two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. The carbons next to each ketone are part of the benzene ring and are each bonded to another carbon (the ring), but no hydrogen. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen when it's a mono-substituted. So in para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons, but the other carbons have a hydrogen each.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-C6H2-C=O, but arranged para, so the carbonyl groups are on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5,6 would each have a hydrogen. So the carbonyl groups are on C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1; C3 and C5 for C4) each have a hydrogen. So in this case, the alpha positions (C2 and C6 for the first carbonyl, and C3 and C5 for the second) have hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try a different approach. Which of these two compounds doesn't have alpha hydrogens? Because if a compound doesn't have alpha hydrogens, it can't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think it does have alpha hydrogens because the ring is such that the carbonyl groups are attached to carbons that have adjacent hydrogens.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each carbonyl group is attached to a CH2 group. So each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. So definitely, this compound has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, so both have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. But that's not possible because the question states that one doesn't. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens. How? Let me think again about the structure. If each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to another carbonyl, perhaps the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to another carbonyl, so the adjacent carbons have no hydrogens. For example, if the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O in a ring. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a structure where the three carbonyls are adjacent, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is flanked by other carbonyls, so their adjacent carbons have no hydrogens. Wait, if it's 1,3,5-trione, each is separated by one carbon. So for example, positions 1,3,5 are carbonyl groups, and positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which has two hydrogens. So yes, alpha hydrogens are present, so tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but according to the question, one of them doesn't show tautomerism. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the carbonyl groups are in a conjugated system, making the alpha hydrogens unavailable. Or maybe in one of the compounds the carbonyl groups are so conjugated that the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds lacks alpha hydrogens. So, for example, if a compound has a carbonyl group where the adjacent carbon doesn't have a hydrogen, it can't tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: the adjacent carbons (in the ring) have hydrogens. So yes.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So both have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. But that's not possible because the question says one doesn't.

Wait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think about the actual possibility of tautomerism in these structures.

In benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. The adjacent carbons each have a hydrogen. So, the alpha hydrogens are available. But when I think about the possibility of enol formation, the conjugated system is already extensive, so maybe the enol form isn't very stable. Or perhaps in this case, the enol form isn't possible because the ring is already conjugated, making the necessary hydrogen shift impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is so rigid that the tautomerism isn't possible. Wait, but I'm not sure. I think that, regardless, the presence of alpha hydrogens is necessary for tautomerism. So if a compound doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, it can't show tautomerism.

Hmm, let me think about another compound. Acetone has alpha hydrogens and shows tautomerism. Benzophenone also has alpha hydrogens and can tautomerize. So if both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-trione have alpha hydrogens, why would one not show tautomerism?

Wait, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system where all the carbonyl groups are conjugated, making the ring planar, so that the alpha hydrogens are not on the same plane as the carbonyl, preventing tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione is a fully conjugated system, so the necessary movement for tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe one of the compounds doesn't have any H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, benzoquinone: each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Each of these adjacent carbons has a hydrogen. So yes, alpha hydrogens are present.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So each has two alpha hydrogens.

So both can undergo tautomerism. But the question says one does not. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that.

Wait, perhaps in one of them, the alpha hydrogens are not available due to some structural reason.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. How? Let me think again about the structure. Benzene is a six-membered ring, each carbon bonded to one hydrogen in the mono-substituted case. In benzoquinone, the para positions have ketone groups. So each of those ketone groups is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring.

So the ring carbons adjacent to the ketones are two carbons away from each other. So each of those carbons (C2 and C6 for the first ketone, and C3 and C5 for the second ketone) have a hydrogen. So yes, they have alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but in some cases, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for enolization. For example, in some cyclic ketones, the ring's structure prevents the necessary hydrogen shift. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, so each has two hydrogens. So that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at part B to see if that helps.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-OH-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when esterified, the -OH becomes -OCH3 in the ester. So the ester would be CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be the acid with the -OH replaced by OCH3. So structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the structure CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So is there a chiral center here?

Looking at the structure: the central carbon (CH2). Let me count. The central carbon is attached to:

- OCH3 (from the ester),
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps I should number it correctly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, with the COOH at the end.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, when esterified, the hydroxyl becomes an OMe group. So structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: the 2-hydroxy becomes OMe, so the structure would be CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. 

So the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- OCH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2 connected to the first and third carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as:

The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon in the acid) becomes OCH3 in the ester. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me draw it as:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH) has:

- CH3 (methyl),
- OCH3 (from esterification),
- COOCH3 (carboxyl ester),
- and another CH group? Wait, no, in that structure, the central carbon is connected to three other carbons: the methyl group, the COOCH3 group, and the adjacent CH3 from the other side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH.

When the hydroxyl is esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OCH3) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? Or is it attached to two CH3 groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OCH3)
|
CH3-C-COOCH3

No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH(OCH3), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is CH, attached to CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to three other carbons and an oxygen. No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OCH3 (ester group),
- COOCH3 (ester group),
- and the third carbon (the COOCH3 is on the third carbon?).

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the possible chiral centers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the one that was the 2nd carbon in the acid) is connected to:

- two CH3 groups (from the first and third carbons?),
- an OCH3 group,
- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me think, the structure when the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid:

The structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOH.

Esterification with methanol would replace the OH on the second carbon with OCH3, so the structure becomes:

CH3-CHOCH3-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the COOH would become COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the second carbon: connected to:

- a CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- and another CH group (from the third carbon?).

Wait, maybe the central carbon has four different groups attached. Let me check:

- Group 1: CH3 (from first carbon),
- Group 2: OCH3 (ester),
- Group 3: CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon, which is CH2 connected to COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's a single bond. So the third carbon is COOCH3.

So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and CH2 (no, wait, no, the third carbon is COOCH3, so the central carbon is attached to that.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the second C) is attached to:

- CH3 (from first C),
- OCH3,
- COOCH3 (from third C),
- and another CH group? Or is it a CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's:

The second C has:

CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and a single bond to the third C, which is a COOCH3 group. So the second C is connected to four different groups? Let's see:

- CH3 (from first C),
- OCH3,
- COOCH3 (from third C),
- and a single bond to the third C (which is also connected to the COOCH3). Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3.

Wait, that can't be because then two groups would be CH3 and OCH3, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is CH, connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group leading to the COOCH3. No, that doesn't seem right either.

Maybe I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then it's chiral.

Let's see:

- Group 1: CH3,
- Group 2: OCH3,
- Group 3: COOCH3,
- Group 4: CH2 (but that's just a single bond, so perhaps it's a CH2 group connected to something else, but in that case, the groups may not be four different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and the third carbon (CH2? Or COOCH3 itself?).

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe it's better to think about the possibility of a chiral center. If the central carbon has four different groups attached, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the former 2nd C in the acid) is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and another group. Hmm, perhaps the third group is another CH2 group connected to the COOCH3, but that might not make it four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is connected to two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the other compound: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups on adjacent carbons, with the double bond in the cis configuration. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3) ?

No, wait. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each -OH is replaced by OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     CH2-CH2
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \   
    CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
   ||
    O

No, that can't be right. Fumarate is a diester where the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \   
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, but that would be the structure for maleate, not fumarate. Because fumarate has the trans configuration, I think. No, wait, fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Because maleic acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: maleic acid is (trans), and fumaric acid is (cis). So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond.

So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \   
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

But with the two ester groups on the same side (cis), so the double bond is between the two carbonyl groups.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: if the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, because the two ester groups are identical (both are OCH3), and the double bond is in the center. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So in that case, the compound would not have optical isomerism because it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is dimethyl fumarate, which is the cis diastereomer of the ester, does it have a plane of symmetry?

In the structure where both ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. So each half is a mirror image of the other. Hence, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Because in the case of fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side, making the molecule symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and hence achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon is a chiral center, then the compound would have optical isomers. So let's go back to that.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second C) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and the next carbon (probably CH2 or another group). Wait, perhaps it's attached to:

Wait, the structure is more accurately written as:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the second carbon, which is attached to:

- a CH3 group,
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the groups on the central carbon:

1. CH3,
2. OCH3,
3. COOCH3,
4. CH2-COOCH3.

Which are four different groups, making the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would have optical isomers.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the fourth group is considered the same as another. If the central carbon is attached to a CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and a CH2 group that connects to the COOCH3, then the four substituents are all different. So yes, it's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate does not because it's a meso compound.

So for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

Wait, but the question asks which will show optical isomerism. So the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let's recheck.

If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it's achiral, so no optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier I was confused about part A. Let me try to resolve that again.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, then both would show tautomerism. But the question says one doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe one of the compounds doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. If it's a fully conjugated system, perhaps the adjacent carbons aren't attached to any hydrogens. So, for example, if the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl, so no CH2 groups, perhaps the adjacent carbons are double-bonded, so no hydrogens.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups. So perhaps the structure is O=C-C-O-C-O-C-O in a ring. No, that can't be right because that would require more than six atoms. Alternatively, maybe the ring has alternating double bonds, making a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the structure is similar to benzene but with ketone groups at every other position, leading to a conjugated system where the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each ketone is conjugated with the next, leading to no alpha hydrogens. For example, O=C-C=C-O-C=C-O in a ring. But that would require a six-membered ring with three double bonds, which is possible as a conjugated system. In such a case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are double-bonded, so they don't have any hydrogens. So no alpha hydrogens, thus no tautomerism.

So in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would not have alpha hydrogens and thus would not show tautomerism.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, so it does show tautomerism.

So part A's correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

So putting it all together:

A) A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (doesn't show tautomerism),
B) B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option C says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is dimethyl fumarate. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option A says A is cyclohexane and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl → if B is correct but A is wrong.

C) A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate → B is incorrect.

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → both incorrect.

So the correct option is A) A = cyclohexane, B = methyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group). 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and have hydrogens attached. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of a conjugated system, and there are no hydrogens attached to these carbons. Since there are no alpha hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a lack of internal symmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OCH₃, COOCH₃, and the third carbon. Since this carbon is a chiral center, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is a cis-diestereomer of maleic acid, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, okay, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the bonding arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same bonding but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let's take them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a connectivity, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the molecule must have both a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen. Oh right, so if a compound can't undergo such a shift, it doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think that's a cyclic quinone. Quinones are cyclic di-ketones. Benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups, maybe in the para positions. So structure would be O=C6H4-C=O. So two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's a cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups, equally spaced. So each O is on a carbon, and the ring has alternating single and double bonds? Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered single-bonded ring. Trione means three ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, I think, but arranged in a ring. So the carbonyl groups are at every other carbon.

Now, tautomerism: for that, the compound needs a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's see:

Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Are the hydrogens on the adjacent carbons? Let's see: the carbonyl is on the benzene ring. So each ketone is attached to a benzene carbon. The adjacent carbons are the other benzene carbons. So, for example, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So each carbon with the carbonyl is attached to two other carbons in the ring. Are those adjacent carbons bearing hydrogens?

Wait, in benzene rings, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's a mono-substituted ring, but in benzoquinone, which is a di-substituted ring (two ketones), each ring carbon is connected to other ring carbons. So the carbonyl carbons are bonded to two other ring carbons. The ring carbons next to the carbonyl groups don't have any hydrogens attached because they're all part of the aromatic ring. So does benzoquinone have any alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups)?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Benzene is a ring of six carbons each with one H when it's a mono-substituted. But in benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring where two of the carbons are carbonyls. So the structure is, I think, O=C-C6H2-C=O. Wait, no, more like two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. The adjacent carbons are also benzene carbons. So do those have hydrogens? Benzene is a planar structure with each carbon bonded to one hydrogen, except when substituted. So in benzoquinone, the carbons next to the ketones are part of the ring and each is bonded to a hydrogen. Oh wait, no. Let me think about the structure of para-benzoquinone. It's two ketone groups on opposite carbons of the benzene ring. So the ring has six carbons, two of which are carbonyl groups. The other four are each connected to a hydrogen. So the carbonyl groups are each attached to a carbon that is next to two other carbons (in the ring), but those adjacent carbons (the ones next to the ketones) are each connected to a hydrogen. So, yes, they have alpha hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, so it should be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that in aromatic systems, the conjugation might prevent certain tautomerism. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of alpha hydrogens is all that's needed. So if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize. But wait, in the case of quinones, I'm not sure if tautomerism is possible because the ring is already conjugated. Let me think. For example, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has an alpha hydrogen. But for something like benzophenone, it's also possible. Wait, but in some cases, tautomerism may not be observed if the structure is too rigid or if the transition state is not favorable. Maybe in some quinones, the structure is such that enol form isn't possible.

Hmm, maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if you have three carbonyl groups in cyclohexane, the ring would probably have to be quite strained. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring with three ketone groups in a conjugated system, like 1,3,5-tricarbonyl cyclohexane. So, each carbonyl is at every other position. Let me imagine the structure: each of the three carbonyls is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to another carbonyl. Wait, but that might make the molecule have conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds only, but if you have three carbonyls, perhaps the ring is actually a cyclohexene with three ketones?

Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic structure. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the tautomerism part. If this trione has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is adjacent to other carbonyls. So the carbons next to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens on them?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be O=C-C-O-C-C-O in a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is connected to another carbonyl. Wait, that can't be right because that would require each carbon to have two carbonyl groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Maybe it's a ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl, and the others are CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have carbonyl groups on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is a six-membered ring where three alternate carbons are carbonyls. So between each carbonyl is a CH2 group. So the structure is O=C-CH2-C=O-CH2-C=O in a ring. Wait, but that would require the ring to have single bonds only. So each carbonyl is at positions 1, 3, 5, and each is connected by CH2 groups.

In this structure, each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to a CH2 group. So the CH2 groups are adjacent to the carbonyls. So the CH2 groups have hydrogens, which are alpha hydrogens. So, yes, this compound has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyls. So it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric and the carbonyls are separated by CH2 groups, then perhaps each has alpha hydrogens. So both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. So both can undergo tautomerism.

But that can't be right because the question says one does not show tautomerism. So perhaps one of them doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Let me think again.

Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The adjacent carbons are each part of the benzene ring, right? Each of those adjacent carbons is bonded to two other carbons in the ring, so maybe they don't have any hydrogens attached. Wait, no, each carbon in the benzene ring (apart from the two substituted with carbonyls) has a hydrogen. So for benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene carbons, each of which is adjacent to two other benzene carbons, each of which has a hydrogen. So in that case, the carbonyl carbons are attached to benzene carbons that have adjacent hydrogens. So, yes, alpha hydrogens are present.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are conjugated with the benzene ring, making the adjacent positions part of an aromatic system. So the adjacent carbons are sp2 hybridized, so they don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen if it's a mono-substituted, but in a di-substituted ring, the adjacent carbons may not have hydrogens. Let me think: in para-benzoquinone, the structure is two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. The carbons next to each ketone are part of the benzene ring and are each bonded to another carbon (the ring), but no hydrogen. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen when it's a mono-substituted. So in para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons, but the other carbons have a hydrogen each.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-C6H2-C=O, but arranged para, so the carbonyl groups are on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5,6 would each have a hydrogen. So the carbonyl groups are on C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1; C3 and C5 for C4) each have a hydrogen. So in this case, the alpha positions (C2 and C6 for the first carbonyl, and C3 and C5 for the second) have hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try a different approach. Which of these two compounds doesn't have alpha hydrogens? Because if a compound doesn't have alpha hydrogens, it can't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think it does have alpha hydrogens because the ring is such that the carbonyl groups are attached to carbons that have adjacent hydrogens.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each carbonyl group is attached to a CH2 group. So each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. So definitely, this compound has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, so both have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. But that's not possible because the question states that one doesn't. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens. How? Let me think again about the structure. If each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to another carbonyl, perhaps the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to another carbonyl, so the adjacent carbons have no hydrogens. For example, if the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O in a ring. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a structure where the three carbonyls are adjacent, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is flanked by other carbonyls, so their adjacent carbons have no hydrogens. Wait, if it's 1,3,5-trione, each is separated by one carbon. So for example, positions 1,3,5 are carbonyl groups, and positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which has two hydrogens. So yes, alpha hydrogens are present, so tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but according to the question, one of them doesn't show tautomerism. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the carbonyl groups are in a conjugated system, making the alpha hydrogens unavailable. Or maybe in one of the compounds the carbonyl groups are so conjugated that the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds lacks alpha hydrogens. So, for example, if a compound has a carbonyl group where the adjacent carbon doesn't have a hydrogen, it can't tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: the adjacent carbons (in the ring) have hydrogens. So yes.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So both have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. But that's not possible because the question says one doesn't.

Wait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think about the actual possibility of tautomerism in these structures.

In benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. The adjacent carbons each have a hydrogen. So, the alpha hydrogens are available. But when I think about the possibility of enol formation, the conjugated system is already extensive, so maybe the enol form isn't very stable. Or perhaps in this case, the enol form isn't possible because the ring is already conjugated, making the necessary hydrogen shift impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is so rigid that the tautomerism isn't possible. Wait, but I'm not sure. I think that, regardless, the presence of alpha hydrogens is necessary for tautomerism. So if a compound doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, it can't show tautomerism.

Hmm, let me think about another compound. Acetone has alpha hydrogens and shows tautomerism. Benzophenone also has alpha hydrogens and can tautomerize. So if both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-trione have alpha hydrogens, why would one not show tautomerism?

Wait, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system where all the carbonyl groups are conjugated, making the ring planar, so that the alpha hydrogens are not on the same plane as the carbonyl, preventing tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione is a fully conjugated system, so the necessary movement for tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe one of the compounds doesn't have any H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, benzoquinone: each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Each of these adjacent carbons has a hydrogen. So yes, alpha hydrogens are present.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So each has two alpha hydrogens.

So both can undergo tautomerism. But the question says one does not. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that.

Wait, perhaps in one of them, the alpha hydrogens are not available due to some structural reason.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. How? Let me think again about the structure. Benzene is a six-membered ring, each carbon bonded to one hydrogen in the mono-substituted case. In benzoquinone, the para positions have ketone groups. So each of those ketone groups is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring.

So the ring carbons adjacent to the ketones are two carbons away from each other. So each of those carbons (C2 and C6 for the first ketone, and C3 and C5 for the second ketone) have a hydrogen. So yes, they have alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but in some cases, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for enolization. For example, in some cyclic ketones, the ring's structure prevents the necessary hydrogen shift. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, so each has two hydrogens. So that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at part B to see if that helps.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-OH-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when esterified, the -OH becomes -OCH3 in the ester. So the ester would be CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be the acid with the -OH replaced by OCH3. So structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the structure CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So is there a chiral center here?

Looking at the structure: the central carbon (CH2). Let me count. The central carbon is attached to:

- OCH3 (from the ester),
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps I should number it correctly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, with the COOH at the end.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, when esterified, the hydroxyl becomes an OMe group. So structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: the 2-hydroxy becomes OMe, so the structure would be CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. 

So the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- OCH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2 connected to the first and third carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as:

The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon in the acid) becomes OCH3 in the ester. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me draw it as:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH) has:

- CH3 (methyl),
- OCH3 (from esterification),
- COOCH3 (carboxyl ester),
- and another CH group? Wait, no, in that structure, the central carbon is connected to three other carbons: the methyl group, the COOCH3 group, and the adjacent CH3 from the other side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH.

When the hydroxyl is esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OCH3) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? Or is it attached to two CH3 groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OCH3)
|
CH3-C-COOCH3

No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH(OCH3), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is CH, attached to CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to three other carbons and an oxygen. No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OCH3 (ester group),
- COOCH3 (ester group),
- and the third carbon (the COOCH3 is on the third carbon?).

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the possible chiral centers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the one that was the 2nd carbon in the acid) is connected to:

- two CH3 groups (from the first and third carbons?),
- an OCH3 group,
- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me think, the structure when the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid:

The structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOH.

Esterification with methanol would replace the OH on the second carbon with OCH3, so the structure becomes:

CH3-CHOCH3-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the COOH would become COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the second carbon: connected to:

- a CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- and another CH group (from the third carbon?).

Wait, maybe the central carbon has four different groups attached. Let me check:

- Group 1: CH3 (from first carbon),
- Group 2: OCH3 (ester),
- Group 3: CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon, which is CH2 connected to COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's a single bond. So the third carbon is COOCH3.

So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and CH2 (no, wait, no, the third carbon is COOCH3, so the central carbon is attached to that.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the second C) is attached to:

- CH3 (from first C),
- OCH3,
- COOCH3 (from third C),
- and another CH group? Or is it a CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's:

The second C has:

CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and a single bond to the third C, which is a COOCH3 group. So the second C is connected to four different groups? Let's see:

- CH3 (from first C),
- OCH3,
- COOCH3 (from third C),
- and a single bond to the third C (which is also connected to the COOCH3). Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3.

Wait, that can't be because then two groups would be CH3 and OCH3, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is CH, connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group leading to the COOCH3. No, that doesn't seem right either.

Maybe I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then it's chiral.

Let's see:

- Group 1: CH3,
- Group 2: OCH3,
- Group 3: COOCH3,
- Group 4: CH2 (but that's just a single bond, so perhaps it's a CH2 group connected to something else, but in that case, the groups may not be four different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and the third carbon (CH2? Or COOCH3 itself?).

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe it's better to think about the possibility of a chiral center. If the central carbon has four different groups attached, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the former 2nd C in the acid) is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and another group. Hmm, perhaps the third group is another CH2 group connected to the COOCH3, but that might not make it four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is connected to two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the other compound: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups on adjacent carbons, with the double bond in the cis configuration. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3) ?

No, wait. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each -OH is replaced by OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     CH2-CH2
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \   
    CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
   ||
    O

No, that can't be right. Fumarate is a diester where the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \   
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

Wait, but that would be the structure for maleate, not fumarate. Because fumarate has the trans configuration, I think. No, wait, fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Because maleic acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: maleic acid is (trans), and fumaric acid is (cis). So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond.

So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \   
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
    ||
     O

But with the two ester groups on the same side (cis), so the double bond is between the two carbonyl groups.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: if the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, because the two ester groups are identical (both are OCH3), and the double bond is in the center. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So in that case, the compound would not have optical isomerism because it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is dimethyl fumarate, which is the cis diastereomer of the ester, does it have a plane of symmetry?

In the structure where both ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. So each half is a mirror image of the other. Hence, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Because in the case of fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side, making the molecule symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and hence achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon is a chiral center, then the compound would have optical isomers. So let's go back to that.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second C) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and the next carbon (probably CH2 or another group). Wait, perhaps it's attached to:

Wait, the structure is more accurately written as:

CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the second carbon, which is attached to:

- a CH3 group,
- an OCH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the groups on the central carbon:

1. CH3,
2. OCH3,
3. COOCH3,
4. CH2-COOCH3.

Which are four different groups, making the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would have optical isomers.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the fourth group is considered the same as another. If the central carbon is attached to a CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and a CH2 group that connects to the COOCH3, then the four substituents are all different. So yes, it's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate does not because it's a meso compound.

So for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

Wait, but the question asks which will show optical isomerism. So the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let's recheck.

If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it's achiral, so no optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier I was confused about part A. Let me try to resolve that again.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, then both would show tautomerism. But the question says one doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe one of the compounds doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. If it's a fully conjugated system, perhaps the adjacent carbons aren't attached to any hydrogens. So, for example, if the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl, so no CH2 groups, perhaps the adjacent carbons are double-bonded, so no hydrogens.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups. So perhaps the structure is O=C-C-O-C-O-C-O in a ring. No, that can't be right because that would require more than six atoms. Alternatively, maybe the ring has alternating double bonds, making a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the structure is similar to benzene but with ketone groups at every other position, leading to a conjugated system where the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each ketone is conjugated with the next, leading to no alpha hydrogens. For example, O=C-C=C-O-C=C-O in a ring. But that would require a six-membered ring with three double bonds, which is possible as a conjugated system. In such a case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are double-bonded, so they don't have any hydrogens. So no alpha hydrogens, thus no tautomerism.

So in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would not have alpha hydrogens and thus would not show tautomerism.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, so it does show tautomerism.

So part A's correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

So putting it all together:

A) A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (doesn't show tautomerism),
B) B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option C says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is dimethyl fumarate. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option A says A is cyclohexane and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl → if B is correct but A is wrong.

C) A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate → B is incorrect.

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → both incorrect.

So the correct option is A) A = cyclohexane, B = methyl.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group). 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and have hydrogens attached. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of a conjugated system, and there are no hydrogens attached to these carbons. Since there are no alpha hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a lack of internal symmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OCH₃, COOCH₃, and the third carbon. Since this carbon is a chiral center, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is a cis-diestereomer of maleic acid, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**
