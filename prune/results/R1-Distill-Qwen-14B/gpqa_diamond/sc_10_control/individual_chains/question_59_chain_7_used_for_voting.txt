Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, I need to find out if there's an excess of acid or base after mixing. Also, the volumes and concentrations of each solution matter a lot because the total volume will change when you mix them.

Let me write down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (strong base)

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely, providing OH- ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but HCl is a strong acid, so it'll give H+ ions.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with CH3COOH. Moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So, 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2. The formula is Ba(OH)2, so each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total moles of OH- is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

But wait, when OH- reacts with H+ from the acids, it'll neutralize. So, I need to find out how much H+ and OH- there is in total.

So, the total H+ comes from both acetic acid and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. Hmm, but when you mix solutions, does the acetic acid dissociate more because of the dilution? Or will it contribute a small amount of H+ compared to the strong acid HCl?

Wait, wait. When you have a solution with both strong and weak acids, the strong acid will fully dissociate, and the weak acid contributes some H+ but much less. So, the initial H+ comes from HCl (0.08 moles) plus whatever comes from CH3COOH, but maybe when we add the base, it'll neutralize some of that.

Wait, but the base is Ba(OH)2, which provides OH-. So the reaction between H+ and OH- will be neutralization. Let me think.

The total H+ from both sources (HCl and CH3COOH) would be:

HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it will dissociate a little. But before neutralization, let me consider the initial H+ from all acids. Wait, but when you mix all these solutions together, the concentrations change because the volumes add up.

So first, let me calculate the total volume.

Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Now, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when you mix them, the OH- will react with H+.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) + some from CH3COOH.

Wait, but the CH3COOH is a weak acid. Let me think about how much H+ it contributes initially. But wait, when you mix all the solutions, the CH3COOH will be diluted, and the solution will have some H+ from it. However, since HCl is a strong acid, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and the OH- is 0.18 moles.

Wait, but the OH- is more than H+ from HCl. So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid's H+.

Wait, no, because the OH- is a strong base. So the OH- will first neutralize any H+ available, including from the weak acid.

Wait, but the weak acid's H+ isn't as strong. Let's think step by step.

So, initial moles of H+:

HCl gives 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH in 0.5 L of 0.1 M is 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. Let me calculate the initial [H+] from CH3COOH. But wait, in the presence of a strong acid (HCl), the solution is strongly acidic, so the acetic acid may not dissociate much. But maybe I can't ignore it entirely.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization reaction will occur between the OH- and the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Let me approach this methodically.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles (but only a small fraction will dissociate, so H+ from it is less than 0.05; let's say it's negligible for initial calculation. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the neutralization first, considering all H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 will react with both HCl and CH3COOH.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll provide OH- ions. The OH- will react with H+ from HCl first because it's a strong acid.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so all its H+ is available. So, H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.08 moles of H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted.

Then, these remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ when OH- is present. The reaction would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can react with a mole of CH3COOH.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- left. CH3COOH has 0.05 moles.

So, the OH- will consume 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, that makes sense. So, all the CH3COOH is neutralized, and there's still 0.05 moles of OH- left.

So, the net effect is that all HCl H+ is neutralized, all CH3COOH is neutralized, and there's 0.05 moles of OH- left in the solution.

Wait, but I should double-check that. Let's go through the steps.

1. Calculate total moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

3. The OH- will first neutralize H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

4. Now, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, so all of it will react, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So, after all these reactions, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH-.

And the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's option A. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, another angle: when the strong base neutralizes the strong acid, and then the remaining base neutralizes the weak acid, leaving an excess of base. So the solution is basic, which makes sense for a pH >7.

But wait, let me make sure that I've considered all the steps correctly.

Another approach: Calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles (but each provides 1 H+ per mole, so 0.05 equivalents).

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH- (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-).

So, total H+ equivalents: 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.18.

The net OH- is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05.

So, 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L.

Concentration: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

pOH = -log(0.041667) ≈ 1.38, so pH is 12.62.

That matches option A.

But wait, another thought: when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, it's possible that some of the OH- would be consumed by the weak acid's dissociation. But in reality, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+ immediately. So, when OH- is added, it would deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH. So, with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH- after HCl is neutralized, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, yes, the net OH- is 0.05 moles.

Therefore, the solution is basic, and the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: when we mix all three solutions, the total volume is 1200 mL. Wait, but wait, the initial volumes were 500, 400, and 300 mL, so 500+400+300=1200 mL. Correct.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

So, pOH is about 1.38, pH is 12.62.

Looking back at the options, option A is 12.62.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes a small amount of H⁺, which is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   - The OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl.  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \).  
     After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ remain} \).
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \).  
     All \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH are neutralized} \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

So, pOH is about 1.38, pH is 12.62.

Looking back at the options, option A is 12.62.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes a small amount of H⁺, which is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   - The OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl.  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \).  
     After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ remain} \).
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \).  
     All \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH are neutralized} \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A
