Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? I think it probably means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So more stars in a larger volume. But wait, since the distribution is uniform, the number per unit volume doesn't change with distance, right?

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in some units, maybe parsecs).

Wait, but when they say "number per unit range of parallax," that's like a count in a slice of parallax. So for each small change in parallax, how many stars are there?

I remember that the number density of stars (n) is uniform. So n is constant. But how does the parallax relate to the actual distance, and how does that affect the number in a given parallax range.

Let me think in terms of volumes. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d+dd should be n * 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd, and n is number per unit volume.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So the volume element in terms of plx would be a bit trickier. Let me try to express everything in terms of plx.

When d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx. Because d is 1/plx, so derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx)^2. So when plx increases by d plx, d decreases by (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is n * 4π (d)^2 * dd. Substituting d as 1/plx and dd as (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Wait, let me write that:

Number of stars, N = n * 4π (d)^2 * dd

But d = 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2.

And dd is (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

Putting it all together:

N = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) d plx
= n * 4π * (1 / plx^4) d plx

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for each increment in plx, how does the number change.

Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of plx." So like, N per d plx. So the expression I have is N = n * 4π / plx^4 * d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx = 1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4. So looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up things. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform (n). So as we go to larger distances (smaller plx), the volume increases, so more stars. So if plx is higher (closer stars), the number per unit plx would be higher.

Wait, the number per unit plx range (like number in a slice of plx width d plx) is n * 4 π (d)^2 * dd. But I think I got that right.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that the number of stars in a shell of radius d is proportional to d² dd, because volume of shell is 4πd² dd. Since the number is n * volume, number N = n 4π d² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx², and dd is -d plx (since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx)^2 d plx.

So substituting back:

N = n *4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/(plx²) d plx )

The negative sign just indicates that d decreases as plx increases, but we're interested in the magnitude, so N = n 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d plx = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) = (n 4π) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the uniform distribution of stars in space. The number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), multiplied by \( n \). Thus, the number of stars in such a shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd
\]

Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the equation for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars per unit range of plx is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

When d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx. Because d is 1/plx, so derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx)^2. So when plx increases by d plx, d decreases by (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is n * 4π (d)^2 * dd. Substituting d as 1/plx and dd as (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Wait, let me write that:

Number of stars, N = n * 4π (d)^2 * dd

But d = 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2.

And dd is (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

Putting it all together:

N = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) d plx
= n * 4π * (1 / plx^4) d plx

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for each increment in plx, how does the number change.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that the number of stars in a shell of radius d is proportional to d² dd, because volume of shell is 4πd² dd. Since the number is n * volume, number N = n 4π d² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx², and dd is -d plx (since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx)^2 d plx.

So substituting back:

N = n *4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/(plx²) d plx )

The negative sign just indicates that d decreases as plx increases, but we're interested in the magnitude, so N = n 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d plx = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) = (n 4π) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the uniform distribution of stars in space. The number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), multiplied by \( n \). Thus, the number of stars in such a shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd
\]

Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the equation for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars per unit range of plx is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
