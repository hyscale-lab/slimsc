Okay, so I have this physics problem about diffraction, right? The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where the intensity shows maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small. Hmm.

Wait, wait. So first, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is a. So when N is very large, the polygon tends towards a circle, and the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Wait, no—wait, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to 'a'?

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is longer than the apothem. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, but the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the actual radius of the circular aperture would be 'a' times some function. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. When N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius 'a'. Or maybe not? Because the apothem is the radius of the inscribed polygon. Let me think. For a regular polygon, the apothem is given by a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex). When N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So in the limit as N→infinite, the apothem a equals R. So the radius of the circle is a. Okay, so the aperture becomes a circle with radius a.

So this becomes the problem of single-slit diffraction. Because in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles. And the first minima (the first dark spot) is given by the condition a sinθ = λ/2, where a is the slit width. But wait, in single-slit diffraction, the condition is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. The first minimum is m=1, so a sinθ = λ.

Wait, but no, wait. The condition for the minima is a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer starting from 1. So the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ, so sinθ = λ/(a). But in this problem, we're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in single-slit diffraction, the first minimum is at m=1, and the second at m=2. So the angular separation would be the difference between θ2 and θ1, but wait, wait, when m increases, what happens to θ? Because for larger m, the angle is larger? Wait, no: for a given a, as m increases, θ increases. So for m=1, θ is some small angle. For m=2, it's another angle, but the difference between m=1 and m=2 is the angular spacing between the first two minima.

But wait, wait, the question says, 'the angular distance between the first two minima.' So for single-slit, the minima are at θ_m where a sinθ = mλ. So for the first minimum, m=1, θ1 = λ/(a) (since θ is small, sinθ≈θ). Second minimum is m=2, θ2 = 2λ/(a). So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/a. But wait, wait, wait, that's if the formula is a sinθ = mλ. Wait, no, wait, let me get this straight.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for single-slit minima is a sinθ = m λ, where m=1,2,... So for m=1, sinθ = λ/(a), θ ≈ λ/(a). For m=2, sinθ=2λ/(a). So θ approximates 2λ/(a). The angular separation between these two minima is (2λ/a - λ/a)= λ/a. But wait, the options given don't include λ/a as an option except option B is 0.500 λ/a, but others are around 0.5-1.22 times λ/a. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Because when N is infinite, the shape is a circle, so the diffraction pattern is a single slit? No, wait, no. No, wait, a circular aperture has a different diffraction pattern than a single slit. Oh, right! When the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is an Airy disk, not the same as single-slit. So the minima in the Airy pattern are more complex. So perhaps I was wrong in assuming it's single-slit.

Wait, so the problem here is that when the aperture is a polygon with very high N (approaching a circle), the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the first minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture occurs at a certain angle.

But wait, for a single slit, the first minimum is at a sinθ = λ, so the angle is θ = λ/(a). But for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at a different condition. Let me recall.

The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Bessel functions. The minima occur where the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at its zeros. The first minimum is when J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, the first minimum after the central maximum is at the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317. So the condition is k a sinθ = 3.8317. But wait, k is 2π/λ. So (2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

Wait, but wait, that's for the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Let me think. The minima for the Airy disk occur at θ_m where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 occur at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the first minimum is at 3.8317, the second at 7.0156. The difference between the two is approximately 7.0156 -3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. So the angular difference would be (3.1839 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute that.

3.1839 / (2π) is about 3.1839/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506. So 0.506 λ/a. So the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but hold on. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk, right? So the minima in the Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317, and the second at 7.0156. So the angular separation is the difference between these two angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a slit, not a circular aperture. Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern should be the circular Airy disk, not a single slit.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is treating the polygon as a collection of N slits, each of width (2a sin(π/N)), but when N approaches infinity, the width becomes 2a, as sin(π/N) approaches 0. Wait, no, that's probably not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width equal to 2a, but that doesn't fit with the apothem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The initial consideration was that when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. Therefore, the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

Alternatively, if it were a single-slit, the angular separation would be λ/a, but that's not one of the options except option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is about half. That doesn't fit. So perhaps it's the Airy disk case.

Wait another thought. Wait, perhaps the polygon is considered as a rectangular aperture? Or perhaps the problem is not considering the shape as a circle, but as a different type of slit arrangement. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a slit of width equal to the length of each side. Wait, for a regular N-gon with apothem a, each side length is s=2a tan(π/N). When N is large, tan(π/N)≈ π/N, so s≈ 2a π / N. As N approaches infinity, s approaches zero. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the apothem a is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the side length s is 2a tan(π/N). So when N is very large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). So s approaches zero as N increases. So perhaps the width of the aperture tends towards zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the apothem.

Wait, maybe when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a is the radius of the circle. So the radius R is a. So the circular aperture has radius R=a. Then, the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. So the minima are at θ where J1(k R sinθ) =0. The first minimum is at J1(π a sinθ / λ) =0. The first zero is at around 3.8317, so 3.8317 * λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.61 λ/a for the first minimum.

Wait, no, wait: let me recast the condition. The condition for the m-th minimum is when (π a / λ) sinθ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for the first minimum, x_m=3.8317. So sinθ ≈ θ = 3.8317 λ/(π a). So approximately 3.8317/(3.1416) ≈ 1.220. So θ ≈ 1.220 λ/(a). Then the second minimum is at x_m=7.0156, so theta is about 7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima would then be 2.23 λ/a - 1.220 λ/a ≈ 1.01 λ/a. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me recheck. The condition for the minima in the Airy pattern is that (π a sinθ)/λ = x, where x is the zeros of J1. So the first minimum is when x=3.8317, so sinθ= (3.8317 λ)/(π a). For small angles, sinθ≈θ, so θ≈3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) * λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈1.220 λ/a. The second is at x=7.0156, so θ2 ≈7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(3.1416) ≈2.230 * λ/a. So the difference between θ2 and θ1 is approximately 2.230-1.220=1.010 λ/a. But none of the options are around 1.01. The options given are A:0.610, B:0.500, C:1.220, D:0.506.

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about a circular aperture but about a single slit of width 'a', and the angular separation is λ/a. But that's not one of the options except option B is 0.5 λ/a. Wait, but if the slit width is 'a', then the first minima is at (a sinθ= λ), so θ≈ λ/a. The second is at 2λ/a, so the separation is λ/a. But in the options, that's not present. So perhaps I'm confusing the concept.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it says the apothems are of the same length 'a'. That's for a polygon. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. And when N is large, the polygon tends to a circle. So the radius R of the circle is a / cos(π/N), but as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches 'a'. So the radius is a.

So the circular aperture of radius a would have its first minimum at θ=1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at 1.220, the second at the next zero, which is 2.230, as I computed before. So the separation is about 1.01 λ/a, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a single slit, but the slit width is not 'a' but 2a. Because for a polygon, each side is a certain length, and the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular N-gon, the side length is 2a tan(π/N). When N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so the side length is approximately 2a (π/N). Hmm, but as N increases, the side length tends to zero. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the side length becomes 2a as N approaches infinity, which would make the slit width 2a.

Wait, if the slit width is 2a, then the condition a sinθ = m λ would become (2a) sinθ = m λ. So the first minimum is at sinθ= λ/(2a), so θ= λ/(2a). The second minimum is at sinθ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. So the angular separation is (λ/a - λ/(2a))= λ/(2a). Which is 0.5 λ/a. That's option B.

But earlier, the problem thought that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, leading to the Airy disk. But perhaps the approach is different. The problem says the apothems are all of the same length 'a'. So for a polygon, maybe each side is of length 's', and the apothem is 'a'. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius R = a / cos(π/N) ≈ a for large N. So R≈a.

Wait, but if the problem is considering the slit width as 'a' (the apothem), then for a single-slit, the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ, so θ=λ/a. The second at 2λ/a. So the separation would be λ/a. But that's not an option. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the slit width is 2a. So the first minimum at (2a) sinθ=λ → θ=λ/(2a). Second minimum at (2a) sinθ=2λ → θ= 2λ/(2a) )=λ/a. So the separation is λ/a - λ/(2a)= λ/(2a) → 0.5 λ/a. Which matches option B.

But wait, why would the slit width be 2a? Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the side length is s=2a tan(π/N). So when N is very large, s≈2a (π/N). But for a circle, the 'apothem' becomes the radius, so the side length (perimeter?) is not applicable. Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is treated as a single slit with width 'a' (the apothem). So the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ → θ=λ/a. The second at a sinθ=2λ → θ=2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. But that's not an option.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. That's approximately the first minimum for a single slit, but the question isn't about the first minimum, but the separation between the first two minima.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Perhaps the problem is about the far field diffraction pattern of a polygonal aperture. But when N approaches infinity, it's a circle, so the Airy pattern applies. The first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, but the question is about the angular separation between the first and second minima. Wait, but the second minimum in the Airy pattern is at approximately twice the angle of the first, but not exactly. It's more than twice, as I calculated earlier. So the separation isn't λ/a.

But none of the options directly match that except option D is 0.506 λ/a. Hmm, where does 0.506 come from?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular separation between the central maximum and the first minimum. That would be approximately 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But the question is about the distance between the first and second minima, which is about 1.01λ/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the first minima after the central maximum and the minima beyond. Wait, maybe the first minima from the central maximum is the first minimum, and the second minima is the next. So the separation between the first and second minima is the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem another way. The condition for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction is that the path difference equals an odd multiple of half the wavelength, but for an aperture, it's when the phases of the light from different parts of the aperture interfere destructively.

Wait, for a polygon with infinitely many sides (circle), the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first minimum is at θ=1.22 λ/(a), and the second is at approximately θ=2.23 λ/(a). So the separation is 1.01 λ/a, which isn't an option.

But the options given include D) 0.506 λ/a. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem isn't about the circular aperture but about a slit-shaped like a regular polygon (like a rectangular slit). Wait, but a regular polygon with infinite sides is a circle, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the polygon is treated as a set of N slits, each of width 2a. So in that case, each slit would contribute to the diffraction pattern, and the overall pattern would be the sum of all the diffraction patterns. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima in the case of a square aperture or another polygon, but for the case where N is very large, it's approximated as a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general case of a regular polygon with N sides. The diffraction pattern for a regular polygon can be more complicated, but for large N, the pattern approaches that of a circular aperture.

But then the angular separation between the first two minima would be the same as that for a circular aperture, which is approximately (x2 -x1) λ/(π a), where x1 and x2 are the first two zeros of J1. So x1=3.8317, x2=7.0156. So (7.0156 -3.8317)=3.1839. So 3.1839 * λ/(π a) ≈ (3.1839/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the first diffraction minimum for a single slit of width equal to the polygon's width. If the polygon becomes a circle, but the slit width is 2a, then the first minimum would be at θ=λ/(2a), and the second at θ=2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a). So 0.5 λ/a, which is option B. But wait, why would the slit width be 2a? Because the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of the side, so the width of the slit (distance from one side to the opposite) would be 2a. That makes sense.

Ah, so if the polygon becomes a circle, the width of the slit is 2a. So the single-slit condition applies, with slit width 's' =2a. So the condition for minima is s sinθ = m λ.

So, first minimum at m=1: (2a) sinθ=λ → θ=λ/(2a).

Second minimum at m=2: (2a) sinθ=2λ → θ=2λ/(2a) =λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first two minima is (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) )= 0.5 λ/a. So option B is 0.500 λ/a.

Wait, but why would the slit width be '2a'? Because the apothem is 'a', which is the distance from the center to the side. So the width of the slit would be twice the apothem, i.e., 2a. So for a single-slit, the width is 2a. That makes sense.

So in that case, the angular separation is 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought the polygon becomes a circle, leading to an Airy pattern. But perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, and so the diffraction is that of a single slit.

So the correct answer would be option B, 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, the options given include D)0.506 λ/a. Hmm. How does that come into play?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a single slit but a double slit. No, that's not the case. Or perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering the polygon's properties.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the minima in a polygonal aperture. For a regular N-gon, the angular positions of the minima can be found using certain formulas, but I don't recall them precisely. Alternatively, perhaps when N is very large, the minima are determined by the same condition as a single slit, but with the width being a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circle, meaning that the diameter is 2a. So the slit width is 2a, making the first minimum at λ/(2a), and the second at λ/a, separation λ/(2a).

But then why is option D present? Oh wait, perhaps the apothem 'a' is the same as the radius in the limit, so the diameter is 2a, so the slit width is 2a. So the minima are determined by 2a sinθ = m λ.

So the first minimum is at θ = λ/(2a), the second at θ=2λ/(2a)= λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. So option B is correct.

But why is option D an option? Because 0.506 is approximately λ/(2a) times some factor.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering the apothem as 'a' and the width as 2a, but perhaps the actual width is 'a'. So the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ, θ=λ/a. The second at a sinθ=2λ, θ=2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. Which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture and using the first minimum as 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima, not the first minimum itself. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe I should remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but their separation isn't exactly 1.22 λ/a. So the separation between the first and second minima is around 2.23 λ/a -1.22 λ/a =1.01 λ/a. But again, none of the options match.

So perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a single slit with width 2a, leading to an angular separation of λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But then, why is option D present? 0.506 is approximately 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.610, which is option A. Or wait, 3.8317/(2*3.1416) ≈3.8317/6.2832≈0.610. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular position of the first minimum as 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. But the question is about separation between first two minima, not the first minimum.

Hmm. Now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

So option D is about 0.506, which is roughly 3.1839/6.2832. Because 3.1839 is the difference between the second and first zeros of J1 (7.0156 -3.8317=3.1839). So 3.1839/(2π) = 3.1839/6.2832≈0.506. So option D is 0.506 λ/a.

So if the problem is about a circular aperture, the angular separation between the first two minima is 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer would be D.

But earlier, I thought that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, leading to the Airy pattern. So the separation between first two minima is about 0.506 λ/a.

But then, why would the problem not just ask for the first minimum's angle, which is 1.220 λ/a (option C). But the question is about the separation between the first and second minima.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option D: 0.506 λ/a.

But earlier, when considering the single-slit approach, the separation would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck between options B and D.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the Airy pattern but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, in the question, the shape is an N-sided polygon. All apothems are same length a. So for a regular polygon, each side is at distance a from the center.

When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius R. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R cos(π/N). When N is large, cos(π/N) ≈1 - (π^2)/(2N^2). So R ≈ a (1 + (π^2)/(2N^2)). So as N approaches infinity, R approaches a.

So the circular aperture has a radius a.

Therefore, the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum is at θ=1.220 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ ≈2.230 λ/a. The separation between them is 1.010 λ/a.

But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit but with width 'a', so the first minimum is at λ/a, the second at 2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width equal to the side length s=2a tan(π/N). When N approaches infinity, tan(π/N)≈π/N, so s≈2a (π/N). But as N approaches infinity, s approaches zero, which doesn't make sense for a slit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consult my notes on diffraction patterns for a circular aperture.

The angular separation between the first two minima in the Airy pattern is given by the difference between the first and second zeros of J1 divided by (2π a /λ). The zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the difference is 3.1839. Therefore, the separation is 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈0.506 λ/a. So option D is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)0.506 λ/a.

When an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\) is illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\), the diffraction pattern in the far field depends on the shape of the aperture. For a polygon with \(N\) approaching infinity, the aperture becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern corresponds to that of a circular aperture (Airy disk).

In the Airy disk pattern, the minima occur at angles where the argument of the Bessel function \(J_1\) is equal to the zeros of \(J_1\). The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are approximately \(3.8317\) and \(7.0156\). The angular separation between the first two minima is determined by the difference between these zeros:

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi a} \left(7.0156 - 3.8317\right).
\]

Calculating the difference:

\[
7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839.
\]

Thus, the angular separation is:

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), we find:

\[
\Delta \theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\).

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem about diffraction, right? The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where the intensity shows maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small. Hmm.

Wait, wait. So first, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is a. So when N is very large, the polygon tends towards a circle, and the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Wait, no—wait, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to 'a'?

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is longer than the apothem. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, but the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the actual radius of the circular aperture would be 'a' times some function. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. When N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius 'a'. Or maybe not? Because the apothem is the radius of the inscribed polygon. Let me think. For a regular polygon, the apothem is given by a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex). When N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So in the limit as N→infinite, the apothem a equals R. So the radius of the circle is a. Okay, so the aperture becomes a circle with radius a.

So this becomes the problem of single-slit diffraction. Because in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles. And the first minima (the first dark spot) is given by the condition a sinθ = λ/2, where a is the slit width. But wait, in single-slit diffraction, the condition is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. The first minimum is m=1, so a sinθ = λ.

Wait, but no, wait. The condition for the minima is a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer starting from 1. So the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ, so sinθ = λ/(a). But in this problem, we're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in single-slit diffraction, the first minimum is at m=1, and the second at m=2. So the angular separation would be the difference between θ2 and θ1, but wait, wait, when m increases, what happens to θ? Because for larger m, the angle is larger? Wait, no: for a given a, as m increases, θ increases. So for m=1, θ is some small angle. For m=2, it's another angle, but the difference between m=1 and m=2 is the angular spacing between the first two minima.

But wait, wait, the question says, 'the angular distance between the first two minima.' So for single-slit, the minima are at θ_m where a sinθ = mλ. So for the first minimum, m=1, θ1 = λ/(a) (since θ is small, sinθ≈θ). Second minimum is m=2, θ2 = 2λ/(a). So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/a. But wait, wait, wait, that's if the formula is a sinθ = mλ. Wait, no, wait, let me get this straight.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for single-slit minima is a sinθ = m λ, where m=1,2,... So for m=1, sinθ = λ/(a), θ ≈ λ/(a). For m=2, sinθ=2λ/(a). So θ approximates 2λ/(a). The angular separation between these two minima is (2λ/a - λ/a)= λ/a. But wait, the options given don't include λ/a as an option except option B is 0.500 λ/a, but others are around 0.5-1.22 times λ/a. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Because when N is infinite, the shape is a circle, so the diffraction pattern is a single slit? No, wait, no. No, wait, a circular aperture has a different diffraction pattern than a single slit. Oh, right! When the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is an Airy disk, not the same as single-slit. So the minima in the Airy pattern are more complex. So perhaps I was wrong in assuming it's single-slit.

Wait, so the problem here is that when the aperture is a polygon with very high N (approaching a circle), the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the first minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture occurs at a certain angle.

But wait, for a single slit, the first minimum is at a sinθ = λ, so the angle is θ = λ/(a). But for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at a different condition. Let me recall.

The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Bessel functions. The minima occur where the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at its zeros. The first minimum is when J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, the first minimum after the central maximum is at the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317. So the condition is k a sinθ = 3.8317. But wait, k is 2π/λ. So (2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

Wait, but wait, that's for the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Let me think. The minima for the Airy disk occur at θ_m where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 occur at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the first minimum is at 3.8317, the second at 7.0156. The difference between the two is approximately 7.0156 -3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. So the angular difference would be (3.1839 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute that.

3.1839 / (2π) is about 3.1839/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506. So 0.506 λ/a. So the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but hold on. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk, right? So the minima in the Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317, and the second at 7.0156. So the angular separation is the difference between these two angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a slit, not a circular aperture. Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern should be the circular Airy disk, not a single slit.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is treating the polygon as a collection of N slits, each of width (2a sin(π/N)), but when N approaches infinity, the width becomes 2a, as sin(π/N) approaches 0. Wait, no, that's probably not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width equal to 2a, but that doesn't fit with the apothem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The initial consideration was that when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. Therefore, the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

Alternatively, if it were a single-slit, the angular separation would be λ/a, but that's not one of the options except option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is about half. That doesn't fit. So perhaps it's the Airy disk case.

Wait another thought. Wait, perhaps the polygon is considered as a rectangular aperture? Or perhaps the problem is not considering the shape as a circle, but as a different type of slit arrangement. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a slit of width equal to the length of each side. Wait, for a regular N-gon with apothem a, each side length is s=2a tan(π/N). When N is large, tan(π/N)≈ π/N, so s≈ 2a π / N. As N approaches infinity, s approaches zero. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the apothem a is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the side length s is 2a tan(π/N). So when N is very large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). So s approaches zero as N increases. So perhaps the width of the aperture tends towards zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the apothem.

Wait, maybe when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a is the radius of the circle. So the radius R is a. So the circular aperture has radius R=a. Then, the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. So the minima are at θ where J1(k R sinθ) =0. The first minimum is at J1(π a sinθ / λ) =0. The first zero is at around 3.8317, so 3.8317 * λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.61 λ/a for the first minimum.

Wait, no, wait: let me recast the condition. The condition for the m-th minimum is when (π a / λ) sinθ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for the first minimum, x_m=3.8317. So sinθ ≈ θ = 3.8317 λ/(π a). So approximately 3.8317/(3.1416) ≈ 1.220. So θ ≈ 1.220 λ/(a). Then the second minimum is at x_m=7.0156, so theta is about 7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima would then be 2.23 λ/a - 1.220 λ/a ≈ 1.01 λ/a. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me recheck. The condition for the minima in the Airy pattern is that (π a sinθ)/λ = x, where x is the zeros of J1. So the first minimum is when x=3.8317, so sinθ= (3.8317 λ)/(π a). For small angles, sinθ≈θ, so θ≈3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) * λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈1.220 λ/a. The second is at x=7.0156, so θ2 ≈7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(3.1416) ≈2.230 * λ/a. So the difference between θ2 and θ1 is approximately 2.230-1.220=1.010 λ/a. But none of the options are around 1.01. The options given are A:0.610, B:0.500, C:1.220, D:0.506.

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about a circular aperture but about a single slit of width 'a', and the angular separation is λ/a. But that's not one of the options except option B is 0.5 λ/a. Wait, but if the slit width is 'a', then the first minima is at (a sinθ= λ), so θ≈ λ/a. The second is at 2λ/a, so the separation is λ/a. But in the options, that's not present. So perhaps I'm confusing the concept.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it says the apothems are of the same length 'a'. That's for a polygon. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. And when N is large, the polygon tends to a circle. So the radius R of the circle is a / cos(π/N), but as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches 'a'. So the radius is a.

So the circular aperture of radius a would have its first minimum at θ=1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at 1.220, the second at the next zero, which is 2.230, as I computed before. So the separation is about 1.01 λ/a, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a single slit, but the slit width is not 'a' but 2a. Because for a polygon, each side is a certain length, and the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular N-gon, the side length is 2a tan(π/N). When N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so the side length is approximately 2a (π/N). Hmm, but as N increases, the side length tends to zero. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the side length becomes 2a as N approaches infinity, which would make the slit width 2a.

Wait, if the slit width is 2a, then the condition a sinθ = m λ would become (2a) sinθ = m λ. So the first minimum is at sinθ= λ/(2a), so θ= λ/(2a). The second minimum is at sinθ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. So the angular separation is (λ/a - λ/(2a))= λ/(2a). Which is 0.5 λ/a. That's option B.

But earlier, the problem thought that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, leading to the Airy disk. But perhaps the approach is different. The problem says the apothems are all of the same length 'a'. So for a polygon, maybe each side is of length 's', and the apothem is 'a'. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius R = a / cos(π/N) ≈ a for large N. So R≈a.

Wait, but if the problem is considering the slit width as 'a' (the apothem), then for a single-slit, the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ, so θ=λ/a. The second at 2λ/a. So the separation would be λ/a. But that's not an option. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the slit width is 2a. So the first minimum at (2a) sinθ=λ → θ=λ/(2a). Second minimum at (2a) sinθ=2λ → θ= 2λ/(2a) )=λ/a. So the separation is λ/a - λ/(2a)= λ/(2a) → 0.5 λ/a. Which matches option B.

But wait, why would the slit width be 2a? Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the side length is s=2a tan(π/N). So when N is very large, s≈2a (π/N). But for a circle, the 'apothem' becomes the radius, so the side length (perimeter?) is not applicable. Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is treated as a single slit with width 'a' (the apothem). So the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ → θ=λ/a. The second at a sinθ=2λ → θ=2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. But that's not an option.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. That's approximately the first minimum for a single slit, but the question isn't about the first minimum, but the separation between the first two minima.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Perhaps the problem is about the far field diffraction pattern of a polygonal aperture. But when N approaches infinity, it's a circle, so the Airy pattern applies. The first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, but the question is about the angular separation between the first and second minima. Wait, but the second minimum in the Airy pattern is at approximately twice the angle of the first, but not exactly. It's more than twice, as I calculated earlier. So the separation isn't λ/a.

But none of the options directly match that except option D is 0.506 λ/a. Hmm, where does 0.506 come from?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular separation between the central maximum and the first minimum. That would be approximately 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But the question is about the distance between the first and second minima, which is about 1.01λ/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the first minima after the central maximum and the minima beyond. Wait, maybe the first minima from the central maximum is the first minimum, and the second minima is the next. So the separation between the first and second minima is the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem another way. The condition for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction is that the path difference equals an odd multiple of half the wavelength, but for an aperture, it's when the phases of the light from different parts of the aperture interfere destructively.

Wait, for a polygon with infinitely many sides (circle), the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first minimum is at θ=1.22 λ/(a), and the second is at approximately θ=2.23 λ/(a). So the separation is 1.01 λ/a, which isn't an option.

But the options given include D) 0.506 λ/a. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem isn't about the circular aperture but about a slit-shaped like a regular polygon (like a rectangular slit). Wait, but a regular polygon with infinite sides is a circle, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the polygon is treated as a set of N slits, each of width 2a. So in that case, each slit would contribute to the diffraction pattern, and the overall pattern would be the sum of all the diffraction patterns. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima in the case of a square aperture or another polygon, but for the case where N is very large, it's approximated as a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general case of a regular polygon with N sides. The diffraction pattern for a regular polygon can be more complicated, but for large N, the pattern approaches that of a circular aperture.

But then the angular separation between the first two minima would be the same as that for a circular aperture, which is approximately (x2 -x1) λ/(π a), where x1 and x2 are the first two zeros of J1. So x1=3.8317, x2=7.0156. So (7.0156 -3.8317)=3.1839. So 3.1839 * λ/(π a) ≈ (3.1839/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the first diffraction minimum for a single slit of width equal to the polygon's width. If the polygon becomes a circle, but the slit width is 2a, then the first minimum would be at θ=λ/(2a), and the second at θ=2λ/(2a) = λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a). So 0.5 λ/a, which is option B. But wait, why would the slit width be 2a? Because the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of the side, so the width of the slit (distance from one side to the opposite) would be 2a. That makes sense.

Ah, so if the polygon becomes a circle, the width of the slit is 2a. So the single-slit condition applies, with slit width 's' =2a. So the condition for minima is s sinθ = m λ.

So, first minimum at m=1: (2a) sinθ=λ → θ=λ/(2a).

Second minimum at m=2: (2a) sinθ=2λ → θ=2λ/(2a) =λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first two minima is (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) )= 0.5 λ/a. So option B is 0.500 λ/a.

Wait, but why would the slit width be '2a'? Because the apothem is 'a', which is the distance from the center to the side. So the width of the slit would be twice the apothem, i.e., 2a. So for a single-slit, the width is 2a. That makes sense.

So in that case, the angular separation is 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought the polygon becomes a circle, leading to an Airy pattern. But perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, and so the diffraction is that of a single slit.

So the correct answer would be option B, 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, the options given include D)0.506 λ/a. Hmm. How does that come into play?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a single slit but a double slit. No, that's not the case. Or perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering the polygon's properties.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the minima in a polygonal aperture. For a regular N-gon, the angular positions of the minima can be found using certain formulas, but I don't recall them precisely. Alternatively, perhaps when N is very large, the minima are determined by the same condition as a single slit, but with the width being a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circle, meaning that the diameter is 2a. So the slit width is 2a, making the first minimum at λ/(2a), and the second at λ/a, separation λ/(2a).

But then why is option D present? Oh wait, perhaps the apothem 'a' is the same as the radius in the limit, so the diameter is 2a, so the slit width is 2a. So the minima are determined by 2a sinθ = m λ.

So the first minimum is at θ = λ/(2a), the second at θ=2λ/(2a)= λ/a. The separation is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. So option B is correct.

But why is option D an option? Because 0.506 is approximately λ/(2a) times some factor.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering the apothem as 'a' and the width as 2a, but perhaps the actual width is 'a'. So the first minimum is at a sinθ=λ, θ=λ/a. The second at a sinθ=2λ, θ=2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. Which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture and using the first minimum as 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima, not the first minimum itself. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe I should remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but their separation isn't exactly 1.22 λ/a. So the separation between the first and second minima is around 2.23 λ/a -1.22 λ/a =1.01 λ/a. But again, none of the options match.

So perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a single slit with width 2a, leading to an angular separation of λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But then, why is option D present? 0.506 is approximately 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.610, which is option A. Or wait, 3.8317/(2*3.1416) ≈3.8317/6.2832≈0.610. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular position of the first minimum as 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. But the question is about separation between first two minima, not the first minimum.

Hmm. Now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

So option D is about 0.506, which is roughly 3.1839/6.2832. Because 3.1839 is the difference between the second and first zeros of J1 (7.0156 -3.8317=3.1839). So 3.1839/(2π) = 3.1839/6.2832≈0.506. So option D is 0.506 λ/a.

So if the problem is about a circular aperture, the angular separation between the first two minima is 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer would be D.

But earlier, I thought that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, leading to the Airy pattern. So the separation between first two minima is about 0.506 λ/a.

But then, why would the problem not just ask for the first minimum's angle, which is 1.220 λ/a (option C). But the question is about the separation between the first and second minima.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option D: 0.506 λ/a.

But earlier, when considering the single-slit approach, the separation would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck between options B and D.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the Airy pattern but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, in the question, the shape is an N-sided polygon. All apothems are same length a. So for a regular polygon, each side is at distance a from the center.

When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius R. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R cos(π/N). When N is large, cos(π/N) ≈1 - (π^2)/(2N^2). So R ≈ a (1 + (π^2)/(2N^2)). So as N approaches infinity, R approaches a.

So the circular aperture has a radius a.

Therefore, the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum is at θ=1.220 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ ≈2.230 λ/a. The separation between them is 1.010 λ/a.

But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit but with width 'a', so the first minimum is at λ/a, the second at 2λ/a. The separation is λ/a. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width equal to the side length s=2a tan(π/N). When N approaches infinity, tan(π/N)≈π/N, so s≈2a (π/N). But as N approaches infinity, s approaches zero, which doesn't make sense for a slit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consult my notes on diffraction patterns for a circular aperture.

The angular separation between the first two minima in the Airy pattern is given by the difference between the first and second zeros of J1 divided by (2π a /λ). The zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the difference is 3.1839. Therefore, the separation is 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈0.506 λ/a. So option D is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)0.506 λ/a.


When an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\) is illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\), the diffraction pattern in the far field depends on the shape of the aperture. For a polygon with \(N\) approaching infinity, the aperture becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern corresponds to that of a circular aperture (Airy disk).

In the Airy disk pattern, the minima occur at angles where the argument of the Bessel function \(J_1\) is equal to the zeros of \(J_1\). The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are approximately \(3.8317\) and \(7.0156\). The angular separation between the first two minima is determined by the difference between these zeros:

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi a} \left(7.0156 - 3.8317\right).
\]

Calculating the difference:

\[
7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839.
\]

Thus, the angular separation is:

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), we find:

\[
\Delta \theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\).

Answer: D
