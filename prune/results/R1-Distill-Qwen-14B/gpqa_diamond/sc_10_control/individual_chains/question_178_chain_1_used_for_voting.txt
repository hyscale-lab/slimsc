Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimension calculations... Right, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of [Energy]^4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian should have [mass]^4.

So breaking down the term: κ ψ_bar σ ψ F. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The dimension for a Dirac field ψ is [mass]^(3/2), because in 4D, the action (which is integral of Lagrangian) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For example, for ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_mu ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ_bar is 3/2, and the derivative is mass^1. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 5. Wait, that can't be right... Wait, no, the kinetic term is (∂ψ)^2, so each ψ is 3/2, so ψ bar times ψ would be 3, plus the derivative which is 1, so total dimension is 4 (3+1=4). Oh right, because the term is (ψ_bar ∂ψ), but wait, no, the kinetic term is something like ψ_bar γ^μ ∂_mu ψ, which is dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 5? Wait, that can't be, because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The Lagrangian density has units of energy^4 (since when you integrate over 4 dimensions, it's dimensionless). So each term in it must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [mass]^4.

So for the Dirac field ψ: the dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because the kinetic term is ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_mu ψ. Let's compute its dimension: ψ_bar is 3/2, ∂_mu is 1, ψ is 3/2. So total dimension: 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 5. Wait, that's a problem because the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. Oh wait, no, because the term is like ψ_bar ∂ ψ, which would be (3/2) * (3/2) * (mass^1). Wait, that's 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5. So that can't be, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each term. The term is ψ_bar γ^μ ∂_mu ψ. The dimension for each part: ψ_bar is 3/2, γ^mu is dimensionless, ∂_mu is [mass]^1. ψ is 3/2. So the product is 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5. But the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. That can't be right, so I must be missing something. Oh wait, wait, no. Maybe the Dirac field has dimension 3/2, but when you take the product ψ_bar ∂ ψ, the dimensions should be 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5, but the term is supposed to have dimension 4. Oh wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the correct dimension for ψ is [mass]^(3/2 -1) = [mass]^(1/2)? Because in the action, which is dimensionless, the integral is ∫ d^4x L, so L must have dimension [mass]^4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So, the kinetic term is ψ_bar ∂ ψ. Let me compute the dimension for this term. Let [ψ] = a. Then [ψ_bar] is also a, since it's the adjoint. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So the term ψ_bar ∂ ψ has dimension 2a +1. We need 2a + 1 =4 → 2a=3 → a=3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2.

So each ψ is (3/2). Now, let's go back to the term in the problem: κ ψ_bar σ ψ F.

Each of the fields in the term: ψ_bar has (3/2), ψ has (3/2), and F is the field strength tensor.

The field strength F^{μν} is defined as ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, where A is a gauge field, which is a vector field. For electromagnetism, A has dimension 1. So F would have dimension 2, because each derivative is 1, and each A has 1, so F is (∂A) → 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, so F^{μν} has [mass]^2. Now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ_bar σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimensions of each part.

Breaking it down:

κ is a coupling constant, dimension to be determined.

ψ_bar is (3/2).

σ is a product of gamma matrices. σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Since each γ is a dimensionless matrix (they're just matrices), σ is dimensionless.

ψ is (3/2).

F is (2).

So putting it all together, the term is κ times (3/2) * (dimensionless σ) * (3/2) * (2). So the dimensions are [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Let me compute that:

(3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4. Multiply by 2 → 9/4 *2 = 9/2.

So the entire term's dimension is [κ] + 9/2. But since the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4, this expression must equal 4.

So [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] =4 - 9/2 → which is (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, no, wait, 4 is 8/2. 8/2 -9/2 is -1/2. So [κ]=-1/2.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are -1 or 1.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check each step.

ψ_bar has [3/2], correct.

σ is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is [mass]^2, correct.

So κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = κ * (9/4 * 2) = κ * (9/2). So the total is [κ] + 9/2 =4.

Wait, no, no, wait. The term is κ multiplied by (ψ_bar σ ψ F). Each component's dimension:

ψ_bar: 3/2

ψ: 3/2

F: 2

Multiply all: 3/2 * 3/2 * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2 =4.5.

So the term is κ multiplied by 4.5. The term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So:

[kappa] * 4.5 =4 → [kappa] =4 /4.5 = 8/9 ≈0.888... Which is positive, but none of the options have 8/9.

Wait, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I messed up F's dimension.

Wait, let's reevaluate F's dimension.

The field strength tensor F is for a gauge field. A gauge boson A has dimension 1. So F is ∂A - ∂A, which is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ). Each ∂ has dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F has dimension 1+1=2. Correct.

So the term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3) + 2 = [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

Oh wait, that makes more sense. Because:

Wait, no. The term is κ multiplied by ψ_bar σ ψ F. So the dimensions are [κ] times each component.

Wait, no, the field terms are in the product. So the entire term is [κ] * [ψ_bar] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F].

But [σ] is dimensionless, so:

[κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) )= [κ] * ( (3/2)^2 *2 ) = [κ] * (9/4 * 2) = [κ]*(9/2).

Set this equal to 4:

[κ] * (9/2) =4 → [κ]= (4)*(2/9) =8/9 ≈0.888... Wait, but this is not matching any of the options. The options have -1 or 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dimensions. Maybe I forgot to consider the number of derivatives?

Wait, but the term is ψ_bar σ ψ F. Where σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So that's a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless. So I think that's right.

Wait, wait, maybe the field strength F has a different dimension. Let me think again. F is built from the field A, which is a vector field. For a vector field A_mu, each component has [A_mu] = [mass]^1. Then F^{mu nu} = ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Each term is [∂][A] → 1 * 1 =1. So F has dimension 1. Wait, no, because ∂ is [mass]^1, and A is [mass]^1. So each term in F has dimension 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2. So earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, but that gives [kappa] =8/9, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as F^{mu nu}, and F is antisymmetric. But that doesn't affect the dimension.

Wait, another approach: The term is κ ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

What's the dimension of the entire term? It has to be 4 because it's a term in the Lagrangian.

So [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

Wait, wait, no. Each ψ_bar is [ψ] =3/2. So ψ_bar is 3/2. The ψ is 3/2. F is 2. And σ is dimensionless. So the product is [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) )= [κ]*( (9/4)*2 )= [κ]*(9/2).

Set this equal to 4 → [kappa] = 4 * 2/9 =8/9.

But none of the options match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the structure of the term.

Wait, wait, perhaps the term is not a product of F^{mu nu}, but maybe σ^{mu nu} F_{mu nu} or something else. Wait, no, in the given Lagrangian, it's psi_bar sigma F, and sigma is antisymmetric. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of the fields. Let me recheck.

For a Dirac field ψ, the dimension is 3/2. Correct.

F^{mu nu} is 2. Correct.

So sigma is a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless.

So the product is ψ_bar (3/2) * sigma (0) * psi (3/2) * F (2). So the product is (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2. So the entire term's dimension is [κ] * (9/2) =4. So [κ]=4 * 2/9 =8/9.

But the options only have -1 and 1 for [kappa]. So perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as F_{mu nu}, which is 2, but in the Lagrangian, the term is F^{mu nu}, which is same as F_{mu nu} with indices raised, but dimension is same.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to include some other factors, like the metric tensor? But no, the metric is dimensionless.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the product.

Wait, no. Let me try a different approach. The general rule is that each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The term is L = κ ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each fermion field (ψ) has dimension 3/2. So ψ_bar is 3/2 as well. F has dimension 2.

So the product is: (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) = (9/4) * 2 =9/2.

So κ must have dimension [4] - [product] → 4 - (9/2) = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, no, because the entire term is [κ] multiplied by that product. So the term's dimension is [κ] + (3/2 +3/2 +2) )= [κ] + (3 +2) = [κ] +5. And this must equal 4.

So [κ] +5=4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah! That's where I went wrong earlier. So each field contributes its own dimension, including the F term. So [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F] is (3/2)+(3/2)+2= (3 + 2)=5. So [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ]=-1. That makes sense.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions (or zero). Wait, no, the condition is that the coupling must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in 4D spacetime, but more precisely, the dimension of the coupling must be >= the number of fields minus 4. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the renormalizability condition is based on the superficial degree of divergence. A theory is renormalizable if all interactions have coupling constants with mass dimension ≤4−d, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, in 4D, it's that the coupling must have dimension ≤4− (sum of fields' dimensions - 2), but perhaps I should think in terms of the term's dimension.

Wait, another approach: in 4D, a term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For an interaction term, the form is g φ^n, where g is the coupling. The dimension of g is [g] =4 − (sum of fields' dimensions).

Wait, in this case, the term is κ ψ_bar sigma ψ F. The sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 +3/2 +2= 5. So [κ] =4−5= -1. Which is the dimension we found.

For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants' dimensions must be ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, then the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4 when you have higher-point vertices, leading to non-renormalizable terms.

Wait, but wait, in 4D, a renormalizable interaction must have [g] ≥0. Because [g] =4 − (sum of fields' dimensions). So if [g] is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because higher-order terms (like higher powers of fields) would lead to higher dimensions, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So in this case, [kappa]=-1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options are:

A) [κ]=-1. Renormalizable → No, because [κ] is -1, which implies non-ren.

B) [κ]=1. Ren. → No, because [κ] is -1.

C) [κ]=-1. Not ren. → Yes.

D) [κ]=1. Not ren. → No, because [κ] isn't 1.

So the correct option is C. The mass dimension is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is dimensionless, $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ are Dirac spinors, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the dimensions of the fields:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term has a mass dimension higher than 4 when considering higher-order corrections, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is non-renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimension calculations... Right, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of [Energy]^4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian should have [mass]^4.

So breaking down the term: κ ψ_bar σ ψ F. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The dimension for a Dirac field ψ is [mass]^(3/2), because in 4D, the action (which is integral of Lagrangian) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For example, for ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_mu ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ_bar is 3/2, and the derivative is mass^1. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 5. Wait, that can't be right... Wait, no, the kinetic term is (∂ψ)^2, so each ψ is 3/2, so ψ bar times ψ would be 3, plus the derivative which is 1, so total dimension is 4 (3+1=4). Oh right, because the term is (ψ_bar ∂ψ), but wait, no, the kinetic term is something like ψ_bar γ^μ ∂_mu ψ, which is dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 5? Wait, that can't be, because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The Lagrangian density has units of energy^4 (since when you integrate over 4 dimensions, it's dimensionless). So each term in it must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [mass]^4.

So for the Dirac field ψ: the dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because the kinetic term is ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_mu ψ. Let's compute its dimension: ψ_bar is 3/2, ∂_mu is 1, ψ is 3/2. So total dimension: 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 5. Wait, that's a problem because the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. Oh wait, no, because the term is like ψ_bar ∂ ψ, which would be (3/2) * (3/2) * (mass^1). Wait, that's 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5. So that can't be, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each term. The term is ψ_bar γ^μ ∂_mu ψ. The dimension for each part: ψ_bar is 3/2, γ^mu is dimensionless, ∂_mu is [mass]^1. ψ is 3/2. So the product is 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5. But the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. That can't be right, so I must be missing something. Oh wait, wait, no. Maybe the Dirac field has dimension 3/2, but when you take the product ψ_bar ∂ ψ, the dimensions should be 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5, but the term is supposed to have dimension 4. Oh wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the correct dimension for ψ is [mass]^(3/2 -1) = [mass]^(1/2)? Because in the action, which is dimensionless, the integral is ∫ d^4x L, so L must have dimension [mass]^4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So, the kinetic term is ψ_bar ∂ ψ. Let me compute the dimension for this term. Let [ψ] = a. Then [ψ_bar] is also a, since it's the adjoint. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So the term ψ_bar ∂ ψ has dimension 2a +1. We need 2a + 1 =4 → 2a=3 → a=3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2.

So each ψ is (3/2). Now, let's go back to the term in the problem: κ ψ_bar σ ψ F.

Each of the fields in the term: ψ_bar has (3/2), ψ has (3/2), and F is the field strength tensor.

The field strength F^{μν} is defined as ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, where A is a gauge field, which is a vector field. For electromagnetism, A has dimension 1. So F would have dimension 2, because each derivative is 1, and each A has 1, so F is (∂A) → 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, so F^{μν} has [mass]^2. Now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ_bar σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimensions of each part.

Breaking it down:

κ is a coupling constant, dimension to be determined.

ψ_bar is (3/2).

σ is a product of gamma matrices. σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Since each γ is a dimensionless matrix (they're just matrices), σ is dimensionless.

ψ is (3/2).

F is (2).

So putting it all together, the term is κ times (3/2) * (dimensionless σ) * (3/2) * (2). So the dimensions are [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Let me compute that:

(3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4. Multiply by 2 → 9/4 *2 = 9/2.

So the entire term's dimension is [κ] + 9/2. But since the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4, this expression must equal 4.

So [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] =4 - 9/2 → which is (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, no, wait, 4 is 8/2. 8/2 -9/2 is -1/2. So [κ]=-1/2.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are -1 or 1.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check each step.

ψ_bar has [3/2], correct.

σ is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is [mass]^2, correct.

So κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = κ * (9/4 * 2) = κ * (9/2). So the total is [κ] + 9/2 =4.

Wait, no, no, wait. The term is κ multiplied by (ψ_bar σ ψ F). Each component's dimension:

ψ_bar: 3/2

ψ: 3/2

F: 2

Multiply all: 3/2 * 3/2 * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2 =4.5.

So the term is κ multiplied by 4.5. The term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So:

[kappa] * 4.5 =4 → [kappa] =4 /4.5 = 8/9 ≈0.888... Which is positive, but none of the options have 8/9.

Wait, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I messed up F's dimension.

Wait, let's reevaluate F's dimension.

The field strength tensor F is for a gauge field. A gauge boson A has dimension 1. So F is ∂A - ∂A, which is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ). Each ∂ has dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F has dimension 1+1=2. Correct.

So the term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3) + 2 = [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

Oh wait, that makes more sense. Because:

Wait, no. The term is κ multiplied by ψ_bar σ ψ F. So the dimensions are [κ] times each component.

Wait, no, the field terms are in the product. So the entire term is [κ] * [ψ_bar] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F].

But [σ] is dimensionless, so:

[κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) )= [κ] * ( (3/2)^2 *2 ) = [κ] * (9/4 * 2) = [κ]*(9/2).

Set this equal to 4:

[κ] * (9/2) =4 → [κ]= (4)*(2/9) =8/9 ≈0.888... Wait, but this is not matching any of the options. The options have -1 or 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dimensions. Maybe I forgot to consider the number of derivatives?

Wait, but the term is ψ_bar σ ψ F. Where σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So that's a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless. So I think that's right.

Wait, wait, maybe the field strength F has a different dimension. Let me think again. F is built from the field A, which is a vector field. For a vector field A_mu, each component has [A_mu] = [mass]^1. Then F^{mu nu} = ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Each term is [∂][A] → 1 * 1 =1. So F has dimension 1. Wait, no, because ∂ is [mass]^1, and A is [mass]^1. So each term in F has dimension 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2. So earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, but that gives [kappa] =8/9, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as F^{mu nu}, and F is antisymmetric. But that doesn't affect the dimension.

Wait, another approach: The term is κ ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

What's the dimension of the entire term? It has to be 4 because it's a term in the Lagrangian.

So [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

Wait, wait, no. Each ψ_bar is [ψ] =3/2. So ψ_bar is 3/2. The ψ is 3/2. F is 2. And σ is dimensionless. So the product is [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) )= [κ]*( (9/4)*2 )= [κ]*(9/2).

Set this equal to 4 → [kappa] = 4 * 2/9 =8/9.

But none of the options match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the structure of the term.

Wait, wait, perhaps the term is not a product of F^{mu nu}, but maybe σ^{mu nu} F_{mu nu} or something else. Wait, no, in the given Lagrangian, it's psi_bar sigma F, and sigma is antisymmetric. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of the fields. Let me recheck.

For a Dirac field ψ, the dimension is 3/2. Correct.

F^{mu nu} is 2. Correct.

So sigma is a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless.

So the product is ψ_bar (3/2) * sigma (0) * psi (3/2) * F (2). So the product is (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2. So the entire term's dimension is [κ] * (9/2) =4. So [κ]=4 * 2/9 =8/9.

But the options only have -1 and 1 for [kappa]. So perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as F_{mu nu}, which is 2, but in the Lagrangian, the term is F^{mu nu}, which is same as F_{mu nu} with indices raised, but dimension is same.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to include some other factors, like the metric tensor? But no, the metric is dimensionless.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the product.

Wait, no. Let me try a different approach. The general rule is that each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The term is L = κ ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each fermion field (ψ) has dimension 3/2. So ψ_bar is 3/2 as well. F has dimension 2.

So the product is: (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) = (9/4) * 2 =9/2.

So κ must have dimension [4] - [product] → 4 - (9/2) = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, no, because the entire term is [κ] multiplied by that product. So the term's dimension is [κ] + (3/2 +3/2 +2) )= [κ] + (3 +2) = [κ] +5. And this must equal 4.

So [κ] +5=4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah! That's where I went wrong earlier. So each field contributes its own dimension, including the F term. So [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F] is (3/2)+(3/2)+2= (3 + 2)=5. So [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ]=-1. That makes sense.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions (or zero). Wait, no, the condition is that the coupling must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in 4D spacetime, but more precisely, the dimension of the coupling must be >= the number of fields minus 4. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the renormalizability condition is based on the superficial degree of divergence. A theory is renormalizable if all interactions have coupling constants with mass dimension ≤4−d, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, in 4D, it's that the coupling must have dimension ≤4− (sum of fields' dimensions - 2), but perhaps I should think in terms of the term's dimension.

Wait, another approach: in 4D, a term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For an interaction term, the form is g φ^n, where g is the coupling. The dimension of g is [g] =4 − (sum of fields' dimensions).

Wait, in this case, the term is κ ψ_bar sigma ψ F. The sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 +3/2 +2= 5. So [κ] =4−5= -1. Which is the dimension we found.

For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants' dimensions must be ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, then the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4 when you have higher-point vertices, leading to non-renormalizable terms.

Wait, but wait, in 4D, a renormalizable interaction must have [g] ≥0. Because [g] =4 − (sum of fields' dimensions). So if [g] is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because higher-order terms (like higher powers of fields) would lead to higher dimensions, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So in this case, [kappa]=-1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options are:

A) [κ]=-1. Renormalizable → No, because [κ] is -1, which implies non-ren.

B) [κ]=1. Ren. → No, because [κ] is -1.

C) [κ]=-1. Not ren. → Yes.

D) [κ]=1. Not ren. → No, because [κ] isn't 1.

So the correct option is C. The mass dimension is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is dimensionless, $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ are Dirac spinors, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the dimensions of the fields:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term has a mass dimension higher than 4 when considering higher-order corrections, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is non-renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
