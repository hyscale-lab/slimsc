Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me think through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that should be the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. So, the integration suggests it's the same proton split into two, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Hmm, so it's not like a J-coupling scenario where neighboring protons cause splitting.

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. At elevated temperature, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So same molecular weight but two peaks? That suggests different structures with the same mass or maybe something else.

So, what could cause the NMR to show two peaks for the same alpha proton? Since coupling is ruled out, maybe the compound exists as a mixture of isomers. If it's a diastereomer, their NMR signals would split into separate peaks because diastereomers have different physical properties. But wait, if it's a diastereomer, would the integration add up correctly?

Or maybe it's a pair of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, they should look identical because the environment is the same. But wait, in some cases, if the sample has some impurity or if the instrument isn't perfectly tuned, maybe you could see something else. But usually, enantiomers don't split each other's signals because their coupling is the same. Unless the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, but the NMR wouldn't show separate peaks because each would have the same shift. So that might not explain the NMR observations.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would show up as an additional peak with a different mass. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so probably not.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. As I thought earlier, same mass, but NMR would not split into two peaks because enantiomers are identical in NMR. Unless maybe the diastereotopic protons are causing something, but that's probably not the case here.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Not sure I remember, but maybe during the reaction, some sort of coupling leads to two products. But the NMR suggests same shifts, so maybe that's not it.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would split into separate peaks. For example, if the alpha proton is in a different environment in each isomer, they would have separate signals. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. If the diastereomers are very similar, maybe the shifts are close. Also, the integrals add up to 1H, which makes sense if each diastereomer contributes 1H of that proton.

But wait, would diastereomers have the same molecular weight? Yes, because they have the same molecular formula. So in LC-MS, two peaks of same mass but different structures would appear, which aligns with what the question says.

So the NMR shows two peaks for same alpha H because the two diastereomers have slightly different environments, causing similar but separate shifts. And the integrals add up because each contributes 1H. Also, since the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, that's consistent with diastereomers.

Wait, but the question says the NMR is of the crude compound. So maybe during synthesis, the product is a mixture of diastereomers, which would explain both the NMR and LC-MS results.

So, the options are B and D. Let's think again. Enantiomers (option B) would have same NMR, so the NMR would only show one peak. The fact that two peaks are present suggests diastereomers (option D), which have different environments.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals summing to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. Additionally, LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

To evaluate the options:

- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor):** A precursor would have a different mass, but the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, ruling this out.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are mirror images and have identical NMR spectra because they are indistinguishable in the same environment. Thus, this does not explain the two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):** While "double coupling" could theoretically lead to splitting, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause, making this unlikely.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties due to differences in spatial arrangement, leading to distinct NMR signals. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum could arise from diastereomers, with similar chemical shifts due to their structural similarity. The LC-MS results, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, are consistent with a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Given the observations, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
