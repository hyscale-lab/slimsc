Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think through it. Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We're supposed to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, so Lyman alpha is a specific emission or absorption line. I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, hydrogen's Lyman series transitions. The Lyman alpha line is when an electron moves from the second energy level to the first, emitting a photon at about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm or 0.1216 microns. That's in the far ultraviolet.

Now, if these clouds are absorbing this light, the quasar's light must be passing through them, causing absorption lines. But since the quasar's light is from a distant object, it must have a high redshift. The problem is, we want to detect these clouds with optical telescopes on the ground. Oh, wait, but optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, for the absorption line to be in the optical range when observed, the wavelength must be redshifted into the visible spectrum.

Right, so the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the rest wavelength lambda_rest by 1 + z = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. We need lambda_obs to be in the optical range, which I think is roughly 400-700 nm. Let's pick the lower end, 400 nm, as the cutoff. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's in the optical; if shorter, it's UV and can't be observed from the ground.

So, let's calculate the redshift z. Lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm or 0.1216 microns. Lambda_obs is 400 nm, which is 0.4 microns. So z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1. Plugging in the numbers: z = (0.4 / 0.1216) - 1. Let me compute that. 0.4 divided by 0.1216 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29 minus 1 is 2.29. Hmm, so about 2.29.

Wait, but the options are 3, 1.9, 2.4, and 1.2. So the calculated z is around 2.29. So the lower limit would be this value. Because if it's lower than that, the observed wavelength would be shorter than 400 nm (UV), which we can't see with optical telescopes. So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C) 2.4, and the next is option A) 3. But wait, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, checking the options: the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is higher than D)1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the redshift must be at least around 2.3 to be observed in the optical. But looking at the options, which one is the lower limit? The question is about the lower limit, so any redshift higher than that would be detectable. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options given are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.3 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So if the object has z=2.3, it's just barely in the optical.

Wait, but perhaps I should choose the smallest z such that the observed wavelength is still in the optical. So the minimal z is when lambda_obs is 400 nm. So z is (400/1216) -1.

Wait, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 0.1216 microns. 400 nm is 0.4 microns. So yes, 0.4/0.1216 is about 3.29. So z=2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options don't have 2.3. So the options are C) 2.4 and D)1.9. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so any z above that would be detectable. So if the question is the lower limit, the minimal z is about 2.3. So the answer should be the smallest option that is larger than 2.3.

Looking at the options, 2.4 is option C, which is higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so z must be at least that. So the minimal z is just above 2.3. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4? Or wait, perhaps the calculation is more precise.

Let me compute 400 / 1216 more accurately. Let's do it. 400 / 1216 = ?

Well, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 is 3 times 1216. 400 is much less than that. Wait, no, wait. 1216 *0.33 is about 401. So 0.33.

Wait, wait, 1216 * 0.333333... is 405.333... So 400 is about 0.329 times 1216. So 0.329 is 400/1216. So 0.329 = (1 + z) ?

Wait, no. Wait, (1 + z) = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So if lambda_obs is 400 nm, lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, but 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, wait a minute! Wait, wait, that's a mistake. Oh, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. But 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is 0.1216 microns. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, which is 0.4 microns.

So let me re-calculate. (lambda_obs) is 4000 Angstroms, (lambda_rest) is 1216 Angstroms.

So (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.2908. So z ≈ 2.2908.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So among the options, which is the smallest redshift that is higher than this? The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is higher than D)1.9, which is 1.9, and lower than C)2.4. So if the redshift is 2.29, it's just barely in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, but since the options don't have 2.29, the next highest option is 2.4 (C). So the minimal z is 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options have 2.4 and 1.9. So, the correct answer would be the smallest option that is higher than 2.29. So C) 2.4.

Wait, but why is option D) 1.9 lower than 2.29? So that would mean that for z=1.9, the observed wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z) = 1216 * 2.9? Wait, no, 1.9 + 1 is 2.9. 1216 * 2.9 is approx 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.64 nm. That's in the near UV, but wait, ground-based optical telescopes cannot observe below about 300 nm. So 352.64 nm is still in the UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. So the observed wavelength for z=1.9 would be 352.64 nm, which is UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes.

So any z less than 2.29 would result in lambda_obs <400 nm, which is UV, so not detectable. So z must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29. Looking at the options, the only option higher than this is C)2.4 and A)3. So the minimal is 2.29, but the options don't have that, so the correct answer would be the smallest redshift option that is higher than 2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is the next higher.

Wait, but wait. Is there a possibility that the quasar's emission is in the optical and then after redshift, the Lyman alpha line is in the optical? Let me think: the quasar emits light across the spectrum, but the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. So when the quasar's light is observed, the part of the spectrum where Lyman alpha was absorbed would be in the observed frame.

But if the quasar itself is at a high redshift, its own emission lines would be shifted. Wait, no, the question is about the absorption from the intervening hydrogen clouds. So the quasar's light is the one that's at a certain redshift, and the hydrogen clouds' absorption is at their own redshifts.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the cloud. So that line would be observed at lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z_cloud). We need that lambda_obs to be in the optical, which starts at about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z_cloud >= 4000/1216 ≈3.2908 ⇒ z_cloud >= 2.2908.

So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z_cloud higher than that would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical.

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the answer must be the option that is just above that. Looking at the options, only option C (2.4) and option A (3) are higher. Since 2.4 is the smallest of those, the correct answer is C)2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is within the optical range. Optical telescopes are sensitive to wavelengths approximately in the range \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (or \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \)) and longer. 

The relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift is given by:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (the minimum optical wavelength):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, the redshift of the clouds must be at least \( z \geq 2.29 \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than \( z = 2.29 \), so it satisfies the condition but is not the smallest possible redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than \( z = 2.29 \), so it does not satisfy the condition.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \( z = 2.29 \), so it satisfies the condition and is the smallest option that does so.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than \( z = 2.29 \), so it does not satisfy the condition.

The smallest redshift value that ensures the Lyman alpha line is within the optical range is \( z = 2.4 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think through it. Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We're supposed to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, so Lyman alpha is a specific emission or absorption line. I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, hydrogen's Lyman series transitions. The Lyman alpha line is when an electron moves from the second energy level to the first, emitting a photon at about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm or 0.1216 microns. That's in the far ultraviolet.

Now, if these clouds are absorbing this light, the quasar's light must be passing through them, causing absorption lines. But since the quasar's light is from a distant object, it must have a high redshift. The problem is, we want to detect these clouds with optical telescopes on the ground. Oh, wait, but optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, for the absorption line to be in the optical range when observed, the wavelength must be redshifted into the visible spectrum.

Right, so the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the rest wavelength lambda_rest by 1 + z = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. We need lambda_obs to be in the optical range, which I think is roughly 400-700 nm. Let's pick the lower end, 400 nm, as the cutoff. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's in the optical; if shorter, it's UV and can't be observed from the ground.

So, let's calculate the redshift z. Lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm or 0.1216 microns. Lambda_obs is 400 nm, which is 0.4 microns. So z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1. Plugging in the numbers: z = (0.4 / 0.1216) - 1. Let me compute that. 0.4 divided by 0.1216 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29 minus 1 is 2.29. Hmm, so about 2.29.

Wait, but the options are 3, 1.9, 2.4, and 1.2. So the calculated z is around 2.29. So the lower limit would be this value. Because if it's lower than that, the observed wavelength would be shorter than 400 nm (UV), which we can't see with optical telescopes. So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C) 2.4, and the next is option A) 3. But wait, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, checking the options: the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is higher than D)1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the redshift must be at least around 2.3 to be observed in the optical. But looking at the options, which one is the lower limit? The question is about the lower limit, so any redshift higher than that would be detectable. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options given are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.3 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So if the object has z=2.3, it's just barely in the optical.

Wait, but perhaps I should choose the smallest z such that the observed wavelength is still in the optical. So the minimal z is when lambda_obs is 400 nm. So z is (400/1216) -1.

Wait, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 0.1216 microns. 400 nm is 0.4 microns. So yes, 0.4/0.1216 is about 3.29. So z=2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options don't have 2.3. So the options are C) 2.4 and D)1.9. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so any z above that would be detectable. So if the question is the lower limit, the minimal z is about 2.3. So the answer should be the smallest option that is larger than 2.3.

Looking at the options, 2.4 is option C, which is higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so z must be at least that. So the minimal z is just above 2.3. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4? Or wait, perhaps the calculation is more precise.

Let me compute 400 / 1216 more accurately. Let's do it. 400 / 1216 = ?

Well, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 is 3 times 1216. 400 is much less than that. Wait, no, wait. 1216 *0.33 is about 401. So 0.33.

Wait, wait, 1216 * 0.333333... is 405.333... So 400 is about 0.329 times 1216. So 0.329 is 400/1216. So 0.329 = (1 + z) ?

Wait, no. Wait, (1 + z) = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So if lambda_obs is 400 nm, lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, but 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, wait a minute! Wait, wait, that's a mistake. Oh, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. But 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is 0.1216 microns. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, which is 0.4 microns.

So let me re-calculate. (lambda_obs) is 4000 Angstroms, (lambda_rest) is 1216 Angstroms.

So (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.2908. So z ≈ 2.2908.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So among the options, which is the smallest redshift that is higher than this? The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is higher than D)1.9, which is 1.9, and lower than C)2.4. So if the redshift is 2.29, it's just barely in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, but since the options don't have 2.29, the next highest option is 2.4 (C). So the minimal z is 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options have 2.4 and 1.9. So, the correct answer would be the smallest option that is higher than 2.29. So C) 2.4.

Wait, but why is option D) 1.9 lower than 2.29? So that would mean that for z=1.9, the observed wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z) = 1216 * 2.9? Wait, no, 1.9 + 1 is 2.9. 1216 * 2.9 is approx 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.64 nm. That's in the near UV, but wait, ground-based optical telescopes cannot observe below about 300 nm. So 352.64 nm is still in the UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. So the observed wavelength for z=1.9 would be 352.64 nm, which is UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes.

So any z less than 2.29 would result in lambda_obs <400 nm, which is UV, so not detectable. So z must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29. Looking at the options, the only option higher than this is C)2.4 and A)3. So the minimal is 2.29, but the options don't have that, so the correct answer would be the smallest redshift option that is higher than 2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is the next higher.

Wait, but wait. Is there a possibility that the quasar's emission is in the optical and then after redshift, the Lyman alpha line is in the optical? Let me think: the quasar emits light across the spectrum, but the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. So when the quasar's light is observed, the part of the spectrum where Lyman alpha was absorbed would be in the observed frame.

But if the quasar itself is at a high redshift, its own emission lines would be shifted. Wait, no, the question is about the absorption from the intervening hydrogen clouds. So the quasar's light is the one that's at a certain redshift, and the hydrogen clouds' absorption is at their own redshifts.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the cloud. So that line would be observed at lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z_cloud). We need that lambda_obs to be in the optical, which starts at about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z_cloud >= 4000/1216 ≈3.2908 ⇒ z_cloud >= 2.2908.

So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z_cloud higher than that would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical.

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the answer must be the option that is just above that. Looking at the options, only option C (2.4) and option A (3) are higher. Since 2.4 is the smallest of those, the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is within the optical range. Optical telescopes are sensitive to wavelengths approximately in the range \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (or \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \)) and longer. 

The relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift is given by:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (the minimum optical wavelength):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, the redshift of the clouds must be at least \( z \geq 2.29 \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than \( z = 2.29 \), so it satisfies the condition but is not the smallest possible redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than \( z = 2.29 \), so it does not satisfy the condition.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \( z = 2.29 \), so it satisfies the condition and is the smallest option that does so.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than \( z = 2.29 \), so it does not satisfy the condition.

The smallest redshift value that ensures the Lyman alpha line is within the optical range is \( z = 2.4 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
