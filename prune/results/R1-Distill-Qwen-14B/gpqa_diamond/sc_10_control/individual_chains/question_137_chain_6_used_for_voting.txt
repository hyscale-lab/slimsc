Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, okay, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, right? And a synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, but I think it uses a different approach for acceleration. Let me try to think about how it works.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Maybe each acceleration happens over a certain period. Oh, wait, I think in a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they complete a half-cycle of the applied voltage, right? Or maybe each time they go through a certain point in their orbit.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Phi_0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. So the initial phase is π/4. That's 45 degrees, perhaps that's important for timing when the voltage is applied.

Wait, the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. So I'm thinking about how the number of revolutions relates to the energy gained. Each time the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron, it might get a kick of energy from the electric field.

In cyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field, and their frequency of revolution is determined by the magnetic field strength and their charge. The formula for the cyclotron frequency is nu = (qB)/(2πm), where q is charge, B is magnetic field, m is mass. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, which is a type of cyclotron, maybe that's relevant.

But wait, the key here is the energy gained. The kinetic energy is 950 MeV. What's the initial kinetic energy? It's about zero, so the proton starts from rest. So the total kinetic energy is 950 MeV. I need to find how many times it revolves around the synchrocyclotron to gain that energy.

In cyclotrons, each time the particle goes through the gap between the dees, it's accelerated by the electric field. The voltage applied in the dees alternates, so each passage gives a certain energy gain. But wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each revolution gives two accelerations? Or perhaps each half-revolution? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains a certain amount of energy. So if the voltage is applied in a way that it's maximum when the proton is in the gap, then each passage (like each time it goes through the gap) gives a delta in energy.

But the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Phi_0]. So the frequency of the voltage is nu(alpha). Wait, but what's nu(alpha)? That notation is a bit confusing. Maybe alpha is the angle, like the phase, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the frequency as a function of something else. Maybe it's the same as the cyclotron frequency, which would make sense because in a cyclotron, the particles are kept in a circular path by the magnetic field, and the frequency of the applied voltage is synchronized with the particle's cyclotron frequency.

Wait, right, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is the same as the cyclotron frequency of the particles. So that the particles always experience the accelerating voltage when they pass through the gap. So for each half-cycle of the voltage, the particles get an energy boost.

But in this problem, the question is about the number of revolutions. So each time the proton goes around once, it's accelerated twice? Or maybe once? Hmm.

Wait, in a typical cyclotron, the particles go through the gaps between the dees twice per revolution. Each time they go through, they get a little kick of energy. So each revolution gives two energy gains. So if the applied voltage is such that each half-cycle (each time they pass through the gap) they gain energy, then each revolution (which has two gaps) would give two kicks. So each revolution adds two times the energy per kick.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton completes a half-revolution, it passes through the gap once, thus getting one energy kick per half-revolution. So each full revolution would give two kicks. Wait, that makes sense because the dees are arranged diametrically opposite, so each time the proton goes around, it passes through two gaps in one revolution.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the two dees are opposite each other, and the electric field in the gap alternates direction each time the particle passes. So each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So for each revolution, it passes through the gap twice, thus getting two accelerations. So each revolution adds two energy increments.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So maybe each acceleration corresponds to a single application of the electric field. So each time the particle passes through the gap once, it's accelerated once. So two accelerations would mean passing through the gap twice, which would be a half-revolution? Because in a cyclotron, each gap is 180 degrees apart. So going through both gaps in one revolution.

Wait, perhaps each time the particle goes through a gap, it gets one acceleration. So two accelerations would be two passes through the gaps, which would occur in one full revolution.

But the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps the proton makes two passes through the gaps, which might be part of a single revolution? Or perhaps each revolution involves two accelerations?

I'm a bit stuck on this part. Let me think about the energy gained per revolution.

In a cyclotron, the energy gained per passage is equal to the voltage applied multiplied by the charge. So for each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains e*U, where e is the charge of the proton and U is the voltage. But wait, the voltage here is varying as a function of time. So U(t) is time-dependent.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted to match the cyclotron frequency of the particles as they gain energy. Because as the particles gain energy, their mass increases (relativistically), so the cyclotron frequency changes. This allows the synchrocyclotron to accelerate particles to much higher energies than conventional cyclotrons.

But for this problem, I think we can assume non-relativistic speeds, but wait, 950 MeV is a lot. Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 950 MeV is just a bit above that, so the proton is moving at nearly the speed of light. So relativistic effects are important here. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed in a way that we can use non-relativistic equations for simplicity. Or perhaps the energy per revolution is considered. Let me think.

The energy per revolution would be the sum of the energies gained from each acceleration. Each time the proton passes through a gap, it gains energy e * U0. But wait, the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(...). So the maximum voltage is U0. So each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e * U0 (assuming the voltage is applied in phase with the proton's position).

Wait, but wait, the maximum kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Since the initial kinetic energy is zero, the total energy is 950 MeV. The charge of a proton is e=1.6e-19 coulombs. So the energy per acceleration step is e * U0, where U0 is 190 kV.

Wait, let's calculate the energy per step. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e * U0 = (1.6e-19 C) * (1.9e5 V) = 3.04e-14 J. Let's convert that to electron volts. Since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. So each acceleration step gives 190 keV to the proton.

Wait, that makes sense because the potential difference is 190 kV, so the energy gained per step is e*U0 = 190 keV.

So the total energy the proton gains is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. So each step gives 190 keV, so the number of steps would be 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 steps. Hmm, but wait, each revolution gives two steps, right? Because each revolution passes through two gaps. So the number of revolutions is steps / 2. So 5000 steps would be 2500 revolutions. But wait, 950,000 / 190 is approximately 5000. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 190 * 5000 is 950,000. Yes. So the number of steps is 5000. Each revolution gives two steps, so the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me check the initial conditions.

Wait, the problem states that the initial phase is Phi0 = pi/4. Does that affect the number of revolutions? I think the phase would determine the timing of when the acceleration starts, but since the proton is starting with negligible kinetic energy, perhaps the first acceleration happens at a specific point in the phase. But since we're counting the number of steps (accelerations) regardless of phase, I don't think it affects the total number. Because each time it passes through the gap, it's accelerated, regardless of the initial phase.

Wait, but perhaps the initial phase affects whether the first acceleration is in the correct direction. If the phase is pi/4, the initial voltage is U0 cos(pi/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the first acceleration would be less than full. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the total number of steps. Because each time the proton passes through the gap, it's given a certain energy. Maybe the initial phase just shifts the timing but the total number remains the same.

Another thing: in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted to match the particle's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy. But in this problem, since the initial kinetic energy is negligible, the initial frequency is probably close to the proton's natural cyclotron frequency.

But regardless, the formula for the number of revolutions comes down to the total energy divided by the energy per step, with each revolution providing two steps.

So I think the answer is 2500, which is option D.

To determine how many revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the energy per revolution and the total energy.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the synchrocyclotron is given by \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Energy Gain Per Step**: Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains an energy of \(e \cdot U_0\), where \(e\) is the charge of the proton and \(U_0\) is the maximum voltage. Converting \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) to energy gives:
   \[
   e \cdot U_0 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \cdot (1.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}) = 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)), we find:
   \[
   e \cdot U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV}.
   \]

2. **Total Number of Steps**: The total energy gained by the proton is \(950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}\). Dividing the total energy by the energy per step gives the total number of steps:
   \[
   \text{Number of steps} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV/step}} = 5000 \, \text{steps}.
   \]

3. **Revolutions and Steps**: In a synchrocyclotron, each revolution corresponds to two steps (one step through each gap in the dees). Therefore, the number of revolutions is:
   \[
   \text{Number of revolutions} = \frac{\text{Number of steps}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Initial Phase (\(\Phi_0\))**: The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) affects the timing of the voltage application but does not alter the total number of steps or revolutions. Thus, it does not impact the final result.

From the analysis, the proton makes **2500 revolutions** to reach the final energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\).

So I think the answer is 2500, which is option D.


To determine how many revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the energy per revolution and the total energy.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the synchrocyclotron is given by \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Energy Gain Per Step**: Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains an energy of \(e \cdot U_0\), where \(e\) is the charge of the proton and \(U_0\) is the maximum voltage. Converting \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) to energy gives:
   \[
   e \cdot U_0 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \cdot (1.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}) = 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)), we find:
   \[
   e \cdot U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV}.
   \]

2. **Total Number of Steps**: The total energy gained by the proton is \(950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}\). Dividing the total energy by the energy per step gives the total number of steps:
   \[
   \text{Number of steps} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV/step}} = 5000 \, \text{steps}.
   \]

3. **Revolutions and Steps**: In a synchrocyclotron, each revolution corresponds to two steps (one step through each gap in the dees). Therefore, the number of revolutions is:
   \[
   \text{Number of revolutions} = \frac{\text{Number of steps}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Initial Phase (\(\Phi_0\))**: The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) affects the timing of the voltage application but does not alter the total number of steps or revolutions. Thus, it does not impact the final result.

From the analysis, the proton makes **2500 revolutions** to reach the final energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\).
