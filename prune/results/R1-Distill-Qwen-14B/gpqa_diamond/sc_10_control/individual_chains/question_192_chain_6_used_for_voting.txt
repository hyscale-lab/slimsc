Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The setup is a bit detailed. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Now, they're putting a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Hmm, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. But the distance from the center of the cavity is l, and l is greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. Oh, I'm a bit confused about how l and s relate here, but maybe I can visualize it. The point P is somewhere in space, and the centers of the conductor and cavity are separated by s, so the line connecting the centers is s long. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center and L from the conductor's center. The angle between l and s would determine how point P is positioned relative to the centers.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged initially. But when you place a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in conductors, charges redistribute. But since it's uncharged, any charges induced would have to balance out.

Wait, but for a conductor with a cavity, when you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So, the inner surface gets -q. But because the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance, right? Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner charge is -q, so the outer must be +q. But wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The induced charges on the inner surface would be -q, so to keep the conductor's charge zero, the outer surface must have +q. Yes, that seems right.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is off-center. So, the inner surface charge (which is induced by the charge inside the cavity) isn't uniformly distributed. It would be non-uniform, depending on the position of the charge inside the cavity and the geometry. But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So, what matters for the electric field at P is the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface that includes P. Since P is outside, the Gaussian surface would include the entire conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's total charge is zero, right? Because it was uncharged, and the inner and outer surface charges sum to zero. So, the net charge outside is zero? Hmm, no. Wait, the inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q. So the conductor's total charge is zero. So, the Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose zero net charge. So according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside should be zero. But wait, that can't be right because the charge inside the cavity is +q. Or does it?

Wait a minute, that's the key point. The conductor's net charge is zero, so the electric field outside the conductor due to the conductor's charges is zero. But the charge inside the cavity is enclosed by the conductor, so from outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charges are neutral. So the electric field outside should just be as if the charge is inside a conducting shell.

Alternatively, perhaps the field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center of a point charge. Because the charges on the conductor would redistribute in such a way that the external field is as if the charge is a point charge at the center of the conductor. But wait, the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the field outside would be as if the charge is located at the center of the conductor?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall. For a conducting shell with a charge inside the cavity, the electric field outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were at the center of the shell. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the external field is that of a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this problem, the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. So the charge is placed inside the cavity, but not at the center of the conductor. So would the external field still be as if the charge were at the conductor's center?

Hmm. Let me think about it. The conductor is a conductor, so the charges redistribute. The inner surface will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q. The inner surface's charge distribution depends on the position of the +q inside the cavity. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because it's a sphere. Wait, is that correct? Because if the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge would be uniform because it's a conducting sphere. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which is a uniformly distributed sphere. So the field outside would be that of a point charge Q = +q at the center of the conductor, because the outer surface's charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center according to the shell theorem.

Wait, but wait. The charge on the outer surface is +q, and since it's a spherical shell, its field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the electric field at point P would be due to that +q charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, in this setup, the point P is located at a certain position relative to the centers. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L.

So, the electric field at P would just be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because it's a point charge q at the center, and P is at distance L from the center. Is that correct?

But wait, none of the options seem to exactly match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That would fit if this is the case.

But wait, what if the charge inside the cavity is not at the center? Oh, but the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside depends only on the total charge of the outer surface and the distance from the center. So regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer charge distribution is uniform, leading to the same external field as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in the problem, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance to the cavity's center is l, and the angle theta is given. Does that affect anything?

Wait, the point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's radius is R, and L is the distance from P to the conductor's center, so P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking back at the options, option B matches this.

Wait, but option A is 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That would be the case if the field was due to a point charge located at the position of the cavity's center, but adjusted for the displacement. But no, that's not the case because the conductor's field outside is due to the outer surface charge, which is uniformly distributed. So the external field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity, with radius \( r \) and center separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor, contains a small positive charge \( +q \). The task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, located at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center and \( l \) from the cavity's center. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface induces a charge of \( -q \), and the outer surface induces a charge of \( +q \) to maintain the conductor's neutrality. The outer surface charge is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. According to the shell theorem, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. Since the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge \( +q \) were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

The electric field at point \( P \), which is outside the conductor and at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center, is therefore given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option C** involve \( l \) and \( s \cos\theta \), which are unnecessary for calculating the field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge of the outer surface and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.
- **Option D** incorrectly uses \( l^2 \) instead of \( L^2 \), which does not correspond to the distance from the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which is a uniformly distributed sphere. So the field outside would be that of a point charge Q = +q at the center of the conductor, because the outer surface's charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center according to the shell theorem.

Wait, but wait. The charge on the outer surface is +q, and since it's a spherical shell, its field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the electric field at point P would be due to that +q charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, in this setup, the point P is located at a certain position relative to the centers. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L.

So, the electric field at P would just be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because it's a point charge q at the center, and P is at distance L from the center. Is that correct?

But wait, none of the options seem to exactly match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That would fit if this is the case.

The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking back at the options, option B matches this.

Wait, but option A is 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That would be the case if the field was due to a point charge located at the position of the cavity's center, but adjusted for the displacement. But no, that's not the case because the conductor's field outside is due to the outer surface charge, which is uniformly distributed. So the external field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity, with radius \( r \) and center separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor, contains a small positive charge \( +q \). The task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, located at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center and \( l \) from the cavity's center. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface induces a charge of \( -q \), and the outer surface induces a charge of \( +q \) to maintain the conductor's neutrality. The outer surface charge is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. According to the shell theorem, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. Since the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge \( +q \) were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

The electric field at point \( P \), which is outside the conductor and at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center, is therefore given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option C** involve \( l \) and \( s \cos\theta \), which are unnecessary for calculating the field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge of the outer surface and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.
- **Option D** incorrectly uses \( l^2 \) instead of \( L^2 \), which does not correspond to the distance from the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
