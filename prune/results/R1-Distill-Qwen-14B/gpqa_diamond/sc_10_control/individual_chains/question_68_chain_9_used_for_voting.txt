Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, so I think that's the lowest energy state, right? Because the magnetic moment tends to align with the field to minimize energy. But when the field is turned off, does the spin just change? Or wait, no, the field is turned off and another field is applied along Y. So the particle's spin is now subject to a magnetic field in the Y direction.

Wait, but how does the magnetic moment behave when the field changes direction? I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the direction of the new magnetic field. So the spin will start to precess around the Y-axis. But the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment.

Hmm, I think about how precession affects the components. The initial state is aligned along +Z, so S_z is at maximum. When the field turns to Y, the spin starts to precess around Y. So the components of spin in other directions (like X and Z) will vary sinusoidally over time.

Wait, so the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z. But when the spin is precessing, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. Because as the spin precesses in the X-Y plane, the component of S along Z will change.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The magnetic field is applied along +Y. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since mu is γ S_z, and B is along Y, so H = -γ B S_y. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, μ is γ S_z, so the dot product with B (which is along Y) would be μ · B = γ S_z * B_y, since B is along Y. Wait no, wait: B is a vector. So H is -μ · B. Let me write this correctly.

Wait, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S. Wait, no: the magnetic moment is typically μ = γ S, but when the spin is in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So in this case, μ = γ S (vector). Because S is the spin angular momentum, which has components S_x, S_y, S_z.

So when the magnetic field is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but spin-1/2 systems have their Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices. The energy levels are determined by the expectation value of S_y. So the time evolution would cause precession around the Y-axis.

But I'm supposed to find the frequency at which the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates. So the oscillation of <S_z> over time.

I think this is a problem involving spin precession. The time evolution of the spin in a magnetic field along Y.

Let me think about the energy levels. The energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. H = -γ B S_y. The eigenvalues for S_y for spin-1/2 are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2), and E_- = γ B (ħ/2).

Wait, wait, no: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = -γ B S_y. So E = -γ B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2) * (1) → Wait, no. Let me compute:

H = - γ B S_y. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E = - γ B * (± ħ/2). So E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2) * (+1) → E_+ = - γ B ħ/2. Similarly, E_- = - γ B (ħ/2) * (-1) → E_- = + γ B ħ/2. So the energy levels are symmetric around zero. The energy difference between the two states is ΔE = E_- - E_+ = γ B ħ.

The transition frequency between these states would be ΔE / ħ = γ B.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial state is the spin aligned along +Z. So the initial state is |↑⟩_z. Which is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

Wait, let's think about the state of the system. Initially, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z, |↑⟩_z. Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and turned on in the Y direction. So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously; it's still |↑⟩_z, but now the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y.

The time evolution of the state will be given by the new Hamiltonian. So the state at time t is |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.

We can calculate the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z(t)>, and find its oscillation frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the time evolution in terms of the Rabi oscillations. Wait, but Rabi oscillations are for transitions between spin-up and spin-down under an oscillating field, but here the field is static. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. Since the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y. So the spin vector S will rotate in the X-Z plane with some angular frequency ω.

The components of S in the Z direction will vary sinusoidally. So <S_z> will oscillate as a function of time.

The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy splitting divided by ħ. The energy splitting between the two states is ΔE = γ B ħ, as I calculated earlier. So the frequency is ΔE / ħ = γ B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the time evolution. The state |↑⟩_z can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are the eigenstates of S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So |↑⟩_z = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Then, under the time evolution with H = -γ B S_y, the state evolves as:

|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z
= exp(-i H t / ħ) [ (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ]

H acts on |+y⟩ as E_+ |+y⟩, so:

= [ exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y⟩ + exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2 ), so E_+ t / ħ = - (γ B t) / 2.

E_- = γ B (ħ/2 ), so E_- t / ħ = (γ B t) / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp( i (γ B t / 2) ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i (γ B t / 2) ) |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Now, what is <S_z>?

The expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

But S_z is diagonal in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis. Let me express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The |+y⟩ state is (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ is (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2).

So substituting back:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp(i ω t) (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) + exp(-i ω t) (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Where ω = γ B / 2.

Simplify the expansion:

= [ exp(i ω t) (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩) + exp(-i ω t) (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩) ) ] / (2)

= [ |↑⟩ (exp(i ω t) + exp(-i ω t) ) + |↓⟩ (exp(i ω t) - exp(-i ω t) ) ] / 2

Now, using Euler's formula: exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ, and exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ.

So,

= [ |↑⟩ (2 cos ω t) + |↓⟩ (2i sin ω t) ) ] / 2

= [ cos ω t |↑⟩ + i sin ω t |↓⟩ ]

So the state |ψ(t)⟩ is cos(ω t) |↑⟩ + i sin(ω t) |↓⟩.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) |↑⟩⟨↑| - (ħ/2) |↓⟩⟨↓|.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩⟨↑| ψ(t) |ψ(t)⟩ - |↓⟩⟨↓| ψ(t) |ψ(t)⟩ ]

Wait, more accurately, it's:

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |cos ω t|^2 - |i sin ω t|^2 ]

Because |↑⟩⟨↑| acting on ψ(t) gives |cos ω t|^2 (since the amplitude is cos ω t for |↑⟩), and |↓⟩⟨↓| acting gives |i sin ω t|^2, which is sin² ω t.

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) [ cos² ω t - sin² ω t ]

But cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ), so,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t)

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recheck that.

Wait, the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |cos ω t|^2 = cos² ω t.

The probability of being in |↓⟩ is |i sin ω t|^2 = sin² ω t.

So S_z is ħ/2 times (probability of ↑ - probability of ↓).

Which is (ħ/2) (cos² ω t - sin² ω t) = (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t).

But wait, the initial state had S_z = ħ/2, and after the change, the expectation value oscillates with frequency 2ω. So the oscillation frequency is 2ω.

Because the time dependence is cos(2ω t), so the frequency is 2ω.

But what is ω? Earlier, I defined ω as γ B / 2. So 2ω is 2*(γ B/2) = γ B.

Wait, but in this case, the frequency of the oscillation is γ B.

But wait, let's check this again. The expression for ⟨ S_z ⟩ is (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t), and ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. So the oscillation frequency is 2ω, which is 2*(γ B/2) = γ B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. So the average z-component of the particle's moment is mu_z = gamma * <S_z>.

So ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t)

But we're to find the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩, which is the same as the frequency of the cosine term, which is 2ω.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

Earlier, I said ω = gamma B /2. So 2ω is gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B says gamma B, option A is gamma B/2. Hmm.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the substitution earlier? Let me think again.

The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, with E_+ = - gamma B (hbar/2), E_- = gamma B (hbar/2).

The time evolution is given by the phase factors exp(-i E t / hbar) for each eigenstate.

So the phases for |+y> and |-y> are exp( i gamma B t/2 ) and exp( -i gamma B t/2 ), respectively.

Wait, wait. Because for |+y>, E_+ is -gamma B (hbar/2), so E_+ / hbar is -gamma B /2.

So exp( -i E_+ t / hbar ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

Similarly for |−y>, E_- is gamma B hbar/2, so E_- / hbar is gamma B/2.

So phase is exp( -i E_- t / hbar ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So when I write |psi(t)>, it's [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but when I expanded |+y> and |−y> in terms of |↑> and |↓>, I got into the expression and found that the state is cos(omega t) |↑> + i sin(omega t) |↓>, where omega is gamma B / 2.

So when I plug this into S_z, I get the expectation value as (hbar/2) cos(2 omega t), and 2 omega is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates at gamma B.

But wait, let me think about the time dependence again.

Wait, the expression for ⟨ S_z ⟩ is (hbar/2) cos(2 omega t). The frequency of this oscillation is 2 omega, which is 2*(gamma B/2) = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, let me think about another approach: using the Larmor frequency.

In a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is given by omega_L = gamma B.

But when a spin is in a magnetic field along Y, the precession frequency around Y should still be gamma B.

Wait, but the component of the spin in the Z direction oscillates with the same frequency as the precession frequency.

So the average ⟨S_z⟩ oscillates at gamma B.

Thus, the correct answer is B) gamma*B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy levels are $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   $$ | \uparrow \rangle_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right). $$  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right). $$  
   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent phases are:  
   $$ e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} = e^{i\gamma B t / 2}, \quad e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} = e^{-i\gamma B t / 2}. $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right). $$  

3. **Expressing in $| \uparrow \rangle$ and $| \downarrow \rangle$ Basis**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ in the $| \uparrow \rangle$ and $| \downarrow \rangle$ basis are:  
   $$ |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle \right), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle \right). $$  
   Substituting these into $|\psi(t)\rangle$, we find:  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2) | \uparrow \rangle + i \sin(\gamma B t / 2) | \downarrow \rangle. $$  

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle. $$  
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using $S_z = \hbar/2 (| \uparrow \rangle \langle \uparrow | - | \downarrow \rangle \langle \downarrow |)$, we find:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2(\gamma B t / 2) - \sin^2(\gamma B t / 2) \right). $$  
   Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)$, this simplifies to:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t). $$  

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the frequency of the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Since the magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, so I think that's the lowest energy state, right? Because the magnetic moment tends to align with the field to minimize energy. But when the field is turned off, does the spin just change? Or wait, no, the field is turned off and another field is applied along Y. So the particle's spin is now subject to a magnetic field in the Y direction.

Wait, but how does the magnetic moment behave when the field changes direction? I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the direction of the new magnetic field. So the spin will start to precess around the Y-axis. But the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment.

Hmm, I think about how precession affects the components. The initial state is aligned along +Z, so S_z is at maximum. When the field turns to Y, the spin starts to precess around Y. So the components of spin in other directions (like X and Z) will vary sinusoidally over time.

Wait, so the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z. But when the spin is precessing, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. Because as the spin precesses in the X-Y plane, the component of S along Z will change.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The magnetic field is applied along +Y. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since mu is γ S_z, and B is along Y, so H = -γ B S_y. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, μ is γ S_z, so the dot product with B (which is along Y) would be μ · B = γ S_z * B_y, since B is along Y. Wait no, wait: B is a vector. So H is -μ · B. Let me write this correctly.

Wait, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S. Wait, no: the magnetic moment is typically μ = γ S, but when the spin is in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So in this case, μ = γ S (vector). Because S is the spin angular momentum, which has components S_x, S_y, S_z.

So when the magnetic field is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but spin-1/2 systems have their Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices. The energy levels are determined by the expectation value of S_y. So the time evolution would cause precession around the Y-axis.

But I'm supposed to find the frequency at which the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates. So the oscillation of <S_z> over time.

I think this is a problem involving spin precession. The time evolution of the spin in a magnetic field along Y.

Let me think about the energy levels. The energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. H = -γ B S_y. The eigenvalues for S_y for spin-1/2 are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2), and E_- = γ B (ħ/2).

Wait, wait, no: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = -γ B S_y. So E = -γ B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2) * (1) → Wait, no. Let me compute:

H = - γ B S_y. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E = - γ B * (± ħ/2). So E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2) * (+1) → E_+ = - γ B ħ/2. Similarly, E_- = - γ B (ħ/2) * (-1) → E_- = + γ B ħ/2. So the energy levels are symmetric around zero. The energy difference between the two states is ΔE = E_- - E_+ = γ B ħ.

The transition frequency between these states would be ΔE / ħ = γ B.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial state is the spin aligned along +Z. So the initial state is |↑⟩_z. Which is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

Wait, let's think about the state of the system. Initially, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z, |↑⟩_z. Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and turned on in the Y direction. So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously; it's still |↑⟩_z, but now the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y.

The time evolution of the state will be given by the new Hamiltonian. So the state at time t is |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.

We can calculate the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z(t)>, and find its oscillation frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the time evolution in terms of the Rabi oscillations. Wait, but Rabi oscillations are for transitions between spin-up and spin-down under an oscillating field, but here the field is static. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. Since the field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y. So the spin vector S will rotate in the X-Z plane with some angular frequency ω.

The components of S in the Z direction will vary sinusoidally. So <S_z> will oscillate as a function of time.

The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy splitting divided by ħ. The energy splitting between the two states is ΔE = γ B ħ, as I calculated earlier. So the frequency is ΔE / ħ = γ B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the time evolution. The state |↑⟩_z can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are the eigenstates of S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So |↑⟩_z = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Then, under the time evolution with H = -γ B S_y, the state evolves as:

|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z
= exp(-i H t / ħ) [ (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ]

H acts on |+y⟩ as E_+ |+y⟩, so:

= [ exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y⟩ + exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2 ), so E_+ t / ħ = - (γ B t) / 2.

E_- = γ B (ħ/2 ), so E_- t / ħ = (γ B t) / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp( i (γ B t / 2) ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i (γ B t / 2) ) |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Now, what is <S_z>?

The expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

But S_z is diagonal in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis. Let me express |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The |+y⟩ state is (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ is (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2).

So substituting back:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp(i ω t) (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) + exp(-i ω t) (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Where ω = γ B / 2.

Simplify the expansion:

= [ exp(i ω t) (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩) + exp(-i ω t) (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩) ) ] / (2)

= [ |↑⟩ (exp(i ω t) + exp(-i ω t) ) + |↓⟩ (exp(i ω t) - exp(-i ω t) ) ] / 2

Now, using Euler's formula: exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ, and exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ.

So,

= [ |↑⟩ (2 cos ω t) + |↓⟩ (2i sin ω t) ) ] / 2

= [ cos ω t |↑⟩ + i sin ω t |↓⟩ ]

So the state |ψ(t)⟩ is cos(ω t) |↑⟩ + i sin(ω t) |↓⟩.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) |↑⟩⟨↑| - (ħ/2) |↓⟩⟨↓|.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩⟨↑| ψ(t) |ψ(t)⟩ - |↓⟩⟨↓| ψ(t) |ψ(t)⟩ ]

Wait, more accurately, it's:

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) [ |cos ω t|^2 - |i sin ω t|^2 ]

Because |↑⟩⟨↑| acting on ψ(t) gives |cos ω t|^2 (since the amplitude is cos ω t for |↑⟩), and |↓⟩⟨↓| acting gives |i sin ω t|^2, which is sin² ω t.

So,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) [ cos² ω t - sin² ω t ]

But cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ), so,

⟨ S_z ⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t)

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recheck that.

Wait, the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |cos ω t|^2 = cos² ω t.

The probability of being in |↓⟩ is |i sin ω t|^2 = sin² ω t.

So S_z is ħ/2 times (probability of ↑ - probability of ↓).

Which is (ħ/2) (cos² ω t - sin² ω t) = (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t).

But wait, the initial state had S_z = ħ/2, and after the change, the expectation value oscillates with frequency 2ω. So the oscillation frequency is 2ω.

Because the time dependence is cos(2ω t), so the frequency is 2ω.

But what is ω? Earlier, I defined ω as γ B / 2. So 2ω is 2*(γ B/2) = γ B.

Wait, but in this case, the frequency of the oscillation is γ B.

But wait, let's check this again. The expression for ⟨ S_z ⟩ is (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t), and ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. So the oscillation frequency is 2ω, which is 2*(γ B/2) = γ B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. So the average z-component of the particle's moment is mu_z = gamma * <S_z>.

So ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(2 ω t)

But we're to find the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩, which is the same as the frequency of the cosine term, which is 2ω.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

Earlier, I said ω = gamma B /2. So 2ω is gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B says gamma B, option A is gamma B/2. Hmm.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the substitution earlier? Let me think again.

The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, with E_+ = - gamma B (hbar/2), E_- = gamma B (hbar/2).

The time evolution is given by the phase factors exp(-i E t / hbar) for each eigenstate.

So the phases for |+y> and |-y> are exp( i gamma B t/2 ) and exp( -i gamma B t/2 ), respectively.

Wait, wait. Because for |+y>, E_+ is -gamma B (hbar/2), so E_+ / hbar is -gamma B /2.

So exp( -i E_+ t / hbar ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

Similarly for |−y>, E_- is gamma B hbar/2, so E_- / hbar is gamma B/2.

So phase is exp( -i E_- t / hbar ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So when I write |psi(t)>, it's [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but when I expanded |+y> and |−y> in terms of |↑> and |↓>, I got into the expression and found that the state is cos(omega t) |↑> + i sin(omega t) |↓>, where omega is gamma B / 2.

So when I plug this into S_z, I get the expectation value as (hbar/2) cos(2 omega t), and 2 omega is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates at gamma B.

But wait, let me think about the time dependence again.

Wait, the expression for ⟨ S_z ⟩ is (hbar/2) cos(2 omega t). The frequency of this oscillation is 2 omega, which is 2*(gamma B/2) = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, let me think about another approach: using the Larmor frequency.

In a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is given by omega_L = gamma B.

But when a spin is in a magnetic field along Y, the precession frequency around Y should still be gamma B.

Wait, but the component of the spin in the Z direction oscillates with the same frequency as the precession frequency.

So the average ⟨S_z⟩ oscillates at gamma B.

Thus, the correct answer is B) gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy levels are $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   $$ | \uparrow \rangle_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right). $$  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right). $$  
   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent phases are:  
   $$ e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} = e^{i\gamma B t / 2}, \quad e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} = e^{-i\gamma B t / 2}. $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right). $$  

3. **Expressing in $| \uparrow \rangle$ and $| \downarrow \rangle$ Basis**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ in the $| \uparrow \rangle$ and $| \downarrow \rangle$ basis are:  
   $$ |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle \right), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle \right). $$  
   Substituting these into $|\psi(t)\rangle$, we find:  
   $$ |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2) | \uparrow \rangle + i \sin(\gamma B t / 2) | \downarrow \rangle. $$  

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle. $$  
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using $S_z = \hbar/2 (| \uparrow \rangle \langle \uparrow | - | \downarrow \rangle \langle \downarrow |)$, we find:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2(\gamma B t / 2) - \sin^2(\gamma B t / 2) \right). $$  
   Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)$, this simplifies to:  
   $$ \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t). $$  

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the frequency of the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Since the magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
