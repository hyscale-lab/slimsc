Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide, and then seeing what products form. The TLC shows the reactant spot is getting smaller, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction is probably proceeding, and two products are formed.

First, I need to draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other end of the ether is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since butenyl is four carbons, positions 1-4; so positions 3 and 4 are double bonded). Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to C1 of the butenyl group. C1 is CH2, then C2 is CH (with two methyl groups attached?), wait, let me think.

Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on C2 of the butenyl group, there are two methyl groups. So the structure is:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2

Wait, no, because butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-3-yl? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, no. Butenyl groups have four carbons. The numbering is such that the double bond starts at the lower number. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that can't be because that would require four carbons with the double bond at 3-4, but that's not possible because butenyl is only four carbons. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond at 3-4 because that's the end. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of but-3-en-1-yl as CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, that would be but-1-en-3-yl. Hmm, perhaps I should sketch this.

Butenyl group is four carbons. The correct IUPAC name for the substituent in the question is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be, because C3 and C4 would be the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because four carbons can't have a double bond between 3 and 4. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me see: but-3-en-1-yl has the double bond starting at C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4? That would mean CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that would require the third and fourth carbons to be double-bonded. Wait, that's four carbons, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that's the same as between 1 and 2 if you count from the other end. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but the name says but-3-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

Another way: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, wait. Butenyl groups are named as substituents with the substituent's position given. So, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, how? Let me count. Carbon 1: attached to the oxygen. Then, moving away, carbon 2, carbon 3, and carbon 4. So, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, which would be between the second and third CH2 groups. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because 3 and 4 can't have a double bond if it's four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should draw it as the oxygen attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3) group (since it's 2,2-dimethyl), and then a CH2 and a CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the oxygen is attached to a CH2 group. Then, the next carbon (C2) has two methyl groups (as it's 2,2-dimethyl). So, C2 is CH(CH3)2. Then, C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be: Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's five carbons? No, wait, the butenyl is four carbons. So perhaps it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that's four carbons, so the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is the same as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond in that position because it's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, because the name says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond starts at C3, which is the third carbon from the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps another approach: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's but-1-en-3-yl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because there's no substituent on C3 or C4 beyond the CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh! That makes sense. So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons in the substituent: the oxygen is attached to CH2 (C1), then C2 is C(CH3)2, then C3 is CH, and C4 is CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's a butenyl group, right? So, yes, the structure would be:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, no, the substituent is butenyl, which is four carbons. So perhaps it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be four carbons, so the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but that's five carbons... No, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense with the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh, wait! That makes sense. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the oxygen is attached to the first carbon (CH2), the second carbon is C(CH3)2, then the third and fourth are CH and CH2, with a double bond between third and fourth. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the molecule is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

Now, the reaction is with hydrogen bromide (HBr). So, what kind of reaction occurs when an ether with a substituted allylic position reacts with HBr? I remember that allylic alcohols can undergo acid-catalyzed bromination, but in this case, the starting material is an ether with an allylic group.

Wait, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed cleavage or addition. Alternatively, maybe it's an electrophilic substitution. Hmm. Let me think: HBr is a strong acid and a source of Br+. The allylic position is susceptible to bromination under certain conditions.

Wait, but in ethers, the adjacent carbons might undergo bromination if there's a possibility of allylic stabilization. So, in this case, the structure around the ether oxygen is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The CH2 next to the oxygen is adjacent to the C(CH3)2, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is between CH and CH2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

When HBr is added, perhaps it protonates the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group? Or maybe the allylic position allows for some kind of bromide attack. Alternatively, considering that the substituent is an allylic ether, maybe it undergoes an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether.

Wait, another option: allylic bromination. The allylic position is next to the double bond. So, in this molecule, the CH2 adjacent to the C(CH3)2 is two carbons away from the double bond. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but the starting material is an ether, and the benzene ring is already substituted. So more likely, it's a reaction on the substituent.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction of allyl ethers with HBr. I recall that allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is that the allylic position undergoes bromination, leading to substitution.

Wait, another thought: when an allyl ether is treated with HBr, it can lead to the formation of allyl bromides via an addition-elimination mechanism. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed bromination of the allylic position, leading to substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the allylic position being susceptible to bromide attack. Since HBr is a source of Br-, maybe the allylic hydrogen is abstracted, forming a carbocation, which then reacts with Br-.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So, the CH2-C(CH3)2 is adjacent to the double bond. The allylic position would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So, the CH2 groups on either side of the double bond are allylic.

In this case, the CH2 groups on both ends of the double bond would be allylic. So, perhaps the H from the CH2 adjacent to the double bond is abstracted, leading to a carbocation, which then picks up a bromide ion.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the CH2 groups are on C1 (attached to O), C2 (C(CH3)2), then C3 (CH), C4 (CH2). So in the substituent, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the allylic positions are the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4.

Wait, but in this case, the C2 is C(CH3)2, so it's a tertiary carbon. So, if a bromine were to add here, perhaps via allylic bromination, it would form a bromide at that position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the ether cleavage. Under certain conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage, especially if they're allylic or benzylic. But how does that work with HBr?

Wait, another angle: the starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, which is a strong acid, perhaps the oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, perhaps the adjacent carbon (allylic) could form a carbocation, which could then react with Br-.

Wait, but in the structure, the oxygen is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a C(CH3)2. So, if the ether oxygen is protonated, it becomes O-H+, and the adjacent CH2 could form a carbocation. But the CH2 is attached to a C(CH3)2, so maybe it's not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 could form a more stable carbocation if the double bond can shift.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So, if the CH2 (attached to O) loses a proton, forming a double bond between O and C, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the O could get protonated, making it a better leaving group, leading to cleavage of the ether.

Wait, perhaps the ether cleavage occurs via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. For example, in the presence of H+, the ether oxygen could get protonated, leading to cleavage into two carbocations. But in this case, the oxygen is connected to a CH2 and a benzene ring. So if the O is protonated, perhaps the adjacent C (CH2) could form a carbocation, but that's not very stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the allyl system undergoes some addition. For example, HBr adding across the double bond in an addition reaction. But in that case, the double bond would be protonated, leading to the formation of a bromide on one end and a proton on the other.

Wait, but the starting material has a double bond, so perhaps HBr adds across it, leading to a bromide addition product. But adding HBr to an allyl group would give a bromide at the end. But wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr across the double bond would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, HBr adds across the double bond with anti addition, but perhaps in this case, it's more about allylic bromination.

Wait, another possibility: allylic bromination via the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The allyl system could form a bromonium ion intermediate, leading to bromide attack at the allylic position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but the benzene ring isn't activated in this case. Wait, the substituent is an ether, which is an activating group, but the reaction is with HBr, which is more about electrophilic substitution.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The question states that two new spots appeared, implying two products. So, perhaps the reaction produces two different products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. These are phenols with butyl groups in the 2 and 4 positions. So, perhaps the ether cleavage occurred, replacing the ether with an OH group, but that would require the formation of phenol. Wait, but the starting material is an ether, not an alcohol. How would that happen?

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, one product is a brominated ether, and the other is an ether with a different substituent. Maybe the double bond shifted.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures involve ring formations, perhaps via some cyclization. Chromane is a bicyclic structure, and dihydrobenzofuran suggests a furan ring attached to benzene.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Both are brominated at different positions in the substituent.

Hmm. Let me think about possible reaction mechanisms.

If the starting material is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 and reacts with HBr, perhaps the HBr adds to the double bond. But adding HBr across the double bond would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br, but that seems unlikely because HBr typically adds as H+ to one end and Br- to the other, in a concerted manner. Alternatively, the addition would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2Br-CH2. Wait, but that's not correct because the addition would be anti, but in allylic systems, perhaps it's more about bromination.

Wait, another approach: the reaction could involve the formation of a carbocation at the allylic position. The substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. When HBr is added, perhaps the double bond is protonated, leading to the formation of a carbocation at the more stable position.

Wait, if the double bond is between CH and CH2, perhaps the proton adds to the CH, making it CH2, and the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation. For example, adding H to the end of the double bond and then forming a carbocation.

Alternatively, the mechanism could be similar to the acid-catalyzed addition of HBr to an alkene, but in this case, since it's an ether, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the ether. Under acidic conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage. For example, with HBr, the ether O could be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbon would form a carbocation, which could then react with Br-.

But in this structure, the adjacent carbon is CH2, which is attached to a C(CH3)2 group. If the ether oxygen is protonated, the CH2-OH+ could leave as water, forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. But that carbon is CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the O is protonated, it becomes O-H+, and the CH2 could form a carbocation. But the CH2 is next to a C(CH3)2, so perhaps it's not a very stable carbocation. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

If the double bond is between CH and CH2, then adding a proton to the end (CH2) would form a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, which is C(CH3)2. Wait, but that's already a tertiary carbocation (since C(CH3)2 is connected to CH2 and the adjacent carbons). So, if the proton adds to the CH2 group (the end), the double bond shifts to the neighboring carbons, creating a more stable carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the proton adds to the CH2 group, leading the double bond to shift, creating a carbocation on the C(CH3)2.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

1. Protonation of the ether oxygen by HBr, making it O-H+ and adjacent to a CH2 group.

2. The CH2 group becomes a leaving group (water?), forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, which is C(CH3)2.

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary carbon. So, the carbocation would be at C(CH3)2.

Then, Br- could attack this carbocation, leading to substitution at that position.

So, the substituent would become Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because the double bond is still there. Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br occurs at the C(CH3)2 position.

Wait, but the starting substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. After the carbocation forms on C(CH3)2, Br- would attack, leading to Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH=CH2. But that doesn't seem right, as the double bond is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts during the process. For example, after adding H+ to one end, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but the starting double bond is between CH and CH2. If H+ adds to the CH2 end, then the double bond could shift to between C(CH3)2 and the adjacent carbon, which is CH. But that would make the carbocation on C(CH3)2, which is already a tertiary position, so it's stable.

So, the structure after addition would be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br? No, wait. Let me imagine the steps:

Protonation of O:

Ph-OH+ -CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Then, water leaves, forming a carbocation on the CH2 group, which is adjacent to C(CH3)2.

Wait, but that's a primary carbocation (CH2+), which is not very stable. So perhaps the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

So, the initial structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

After protonation, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation. For example, the double bond might shift to between C(CH3)2 and the adjacent CH, making the carbocation on C(CH3)2, which is tertiary and thus more stable.

So, the structure becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2-+CH2-CH2Br ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The initial structure after protonation would have the double bond between C3 and C4. Adding a proton to C4 (the CH2 group), leading to a carbocation at C3. But C3 is CH, so the carbocation would be on C3, which is secondary. Alternatively, the double bond could shift to between C2 and C3, making the carbocation on C2 (which is C(CH3)2), which is tertiary and more stable.

So, the process would be: protonation of the double bond, shift to form a more stable carbocation, then Br- attack.

So, the product would have Br attached to the C(CH3)2 group.

So, the substituent becomes Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH2-CH3? No, wait, because the double bond has shifted.

Wait, maybe the product would have a bromine on either C3 or C4, depending on where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution of the oxygen with Br. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but that seems less likely.

Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a di-substituted product, such as substitution at two different positions in the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the possible products.

Option D is two products where the bromide is attached at the 3 and 4 positions of the substituent.

Option B has one product where the substituent is brominated at the 4 position, and another where the double bond has shifted.

Option C involves cyclization, which might form a chromane or dihydrobenzofuran structure.

Option A is about the formation of phenols in different positions.

Hmm. Let's consider option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. Chromane is a bicyclic structure with a benzene ring and a cyclohexane ring fused together. Dihydrobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused with a dihydrofuran ring.

How could that form from the starting material? Well, perhaps the substituent (the butenyl group) cyclizes to form a ring. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon in the substituent, leading to ring formation.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the oxygen attacks the CH2 group at the end of the substituent, it would form a five-membered ring (since the substituent is four carbons plus oxygen). Let me count: O connected to CH2, then C(CH3)2, then CH, then CH2. So the substituent is four carbons, so the ring would be five-membered (O, CH2, C(CH3)2, CH, CH2). That would form a cyclohexene oxide or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent forms a ring after bromide attack, leading to a dihydrofuran structure. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon two positions away, forming a five-membered ring.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to an allyl ether, it can lead to ring formation if the substituent is long enough. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon in the substituent, forming a new ring. This would happen via an acid-catalyzed cyclization.

In this case, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The length is sufficient for a five-membered ring to form. So, the oxygen could attack the CH2 group at the end, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to be long enough. Let's see: O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 is four carbons in the substituent. So the distance from O to the end is four carbons. If the oxygen attacks the end CH2, the ring would be five-membered (O, CH2, C(CH3)2, CH, CH2). That's a five-membered ring, which is favorable.

So, in such a cyclization, the oxygen would form a bond with the end CH2, creating a ring:

Ph
|
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH-CH2-O

Wait, but that would form a five-membered ring, which would create a structure similar to tetrahydrofuran fused to the benzene ring. But in this case, it's a larger ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydrofuran structure.

Wait, but if the oxygen attacks the CH2 at the end, the substituent would form a five-membered ring. Let me imagine:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-O-Ph?

No, that's not possible because it's the same molecule. Alternatively, the substituent forms a ring with the oxygen, leading to a structure like chromane or benzofuran.

Wait, perhaps during the reaction, a hemiacetal-like structure forms, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring via an intramolecular attack, leading to a cyclic ether or similar.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent can form a dihydrofuran ring by cyclization.

Wait, another angle: the starting material's substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the double bond shifts during the reaction, perhaps to form a more stable carbocation, and then Br- attacks at different positions, leading to different substitution products.

Wait, if the double bond is between C3 and C4 (CH and CH2), and during the reaction, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3 (C(CH3)2 and CH), forming a more stable carbocation at C(CH3)2, which is tertiary. Then, Br- could attack either at C3 or C4, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 or C4, giving two different products.

Looking at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, the bromine is either at position 3 or 4 in the substituent.

In the substituent, positions 3 and 4 are the two ends of the double bond. So, if substitution occurs at either end, that would make sense.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to bromide substitution at either C3 or C4 in the substituent, giving two products.

But wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The positions in the substituent are numbered starting from the oxygen. So, the substituent is:

O (C1) - CH2 (C2) - C(CH3)2 (C3) - CH (C4) = CH2 (C5). Wait, but that would make it a pentenyl group, not butenyl. Hmm, perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should renumber the substituent correctly.

The substituent is (but-3-en-1-yl), which is four carbons. So:

C1: connected to O (CH2)
C2: CH (with two methyl groups)
C3: CH2 (double bond between C3 and C4)
C4: CH2

Wait, no. But but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's but-1-en-3-yl. I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps I should think of it as:

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that would be four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, substituent structure:

C1: CH2 (attached to O)
C2: CH2
C3: CH
C4: CH2 (but double bond between C3 and C4)

But also, there's a 2,2-dimethyl substitution, so C2 has two methyl groups. So, substituent structure:

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Now, when HBr is added, perhaps the H adds to C4 (the end CH2), making the double bond shift to between C2 and C3 (C(CH3)2 and CH). Then, a carbocation forms at C2 (C(CH3)2), which is tertiary. Br- can attack either at C3 (if the double bond shifts) or at another position.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is as follows:

1. Protonation of the double bond at C4 (end CH2), leading to a carbocation at C3 (CH).

2. The carbocation at C3 is not very stable, so the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, forming a more stable carbocation at C2 (C(CH3)2).

3. Br- attacks this carbocation, leading to substitution at C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond doesn't shift, and the bromide attacks at C4, leading to substitution there.

Wait, but the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If H adds to C4, forming a carbocation at C3 (CH+), which is secondary. That's less stable than a tertiary carbocation, so perhaps the double bond shifts to form a tertiary carbocation.

So, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, making the substituent O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2+.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2+-CH2-CH2Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps again:

- The substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

- HBr adds H+ to the double bond, leading to the more stable carbocation.

- The double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

- Br- then attacks the carbocation, leading to substitution.

If the H adds to C4 (CH2), the double bond shifts to C2-C3, forming a carbocation at C2 (tertiary), which is more stable. Then, Br- attacks, leading to substitution at C2.

But wait, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding H+ to C4 makes the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2H. Then, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, making the substituent O-CH2-C(CH3)2+-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because the shift would form a carbocation at C3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Protonation of the double bond (say, at C4) would give O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2H, which is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH3, but that's not possible because the substituent is butenyl, not pentenyl. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that allows for allylic bromination. So, the substituent's double bond is between C3 and C4. The allylic positions are C2 and C4. Wait, but in this case, C2 is already substituted with two methyl groups, making it a tertiary carbon. So, if a bromide is added at C2, it would give a tertiary bromide, which is more stable.

Alternatively, perhaps bromination occurs at C4, leading to a secondary bromide, but that's less favored than the tertiary position.

So, if the reaction leads to substitution at C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, then the product would have Br at that position.

But looking at the options, option D has bromines at positions 3 and 4 in the substituent. Wait, but in the substituent structure, the positions are C1 (O), C2 (CH2), C3 (C(CH3)2), and C4 (CH=CH2). So, the substituent's C3 is the C(CH3)2, and C4 is CH=CH2.

So, substituting at C3 would mean the substituent becomes O-CH2-CBr(CH3)2-CH=CH2. But that's just substitution at C3.

Alternatively, substitution could occur at C4, leading to O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to two possible products depending on where the H and Br add.

But in an allylic system, addition could lead to different regiochemistry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the options, option D has two products where the substituent is brominated at positions 3 and 4. Let's imagine that during the reaction, the bromide ion can attack either at C3 or C4, leading to two products.

But in the substituent, C3 is C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary carbon, and C4 is CH2.

So, the more favorable product would be substitution at C3 (tertiary bromide), but perhaps some substitution at C4 also occurs, leading to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different sites of substitution based on the carbocation formed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent can form two different carbocations, leading to different substitution products. For example, if the double bond shifts to form a carbocation at C3 (tertiary), then substitution at C3 occurs. If the double bond shifts differently, perhaps a less stable carbocation forms, leading to substitution elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, allowing bromide to attack at either end of the double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. 

Looking at the options again, option D is two brominated products at positions 3 and 4. So, substituent becomes O-CH2-CBr(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br? No, that would make it di-substituted. Alternatively, perhaps one product has Br at C3 and another at C4.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. When HBr adds, it could do so in a way that the Br adds to the end of the double bond, leading to substitution at C4. Alternatively, the Br could add to C3, leading to substitution there.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diastereomer or different regioisomers.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could cause the double bond to shift, leading to different substitution positions.

For example, if the double bond shifts, the carbocation could form at C3 or C2, leading to Br substitution at those positions.

But I'm not sure. 

Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a ring structure, as in option C. For example, the oxygen could attack the end of the substituent, forming a five-membered ring. This would require the substituent to have enough length, which it does (four carbons), so the ring would be five-membered, which is favorable.

If the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and the oxygen attacks the last CH2 group, the ring formed would be O connected to CH2, then C(CH3)2, then CH, then CH2-O. That's a five-membered ring, which is possible.

This would form a structure where the benzene is fused with a dihydrofuran ring, making it 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. And the substituents would be methyl groups from the C(CH3)2.

In option C, one product is 3,3,4-trimethylchromane, which suggests a bicyclic structure where the benzene is fused with a chromane ring. The other product is 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, which has a dihydrofuran ring fused to benzene.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to two different ring formation pathways, leading to the two products in option C.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at two different positions in the substituent, giving two products as in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the ether, leading to substitution of the O with Br, but that would form a bromobenzene derivative, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a phenol and a bromide, as in option A, but that would require cleavage of the ether, which I'm not sure about.

Hmm. Given the options, option D seems plausible if substitution occurs at positions 3 and 4, yielding two brominated products. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the addition of HBr across the double bond, giving two products based on where the addition occurs. However, I'm not sure if that would lead to two products.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to a double bond, it typically adds in a concerted manner, leading to a single product (unless there are stereoisomers involved). But in this case, perhaps the substituent's structure allows for different regiochemistry, leading to two different products.

But I'm not well-versed in the exact regiochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide at the allylic position, and since there are two allylic positions (C2 and C4), two products are formed.

Wait, the substituent has two allylic positions: C2 (C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH2). So, if bromination occurs at both positions, you would get two products.

But in this case, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are C2 (C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH2).

So, if HBr adds Br- at C2 and C4, leading to two different products.

But in option D, the substituents are brominated at 3 and 4, which in the substituent structure, 3 is C(CH3)2 and 4 is CH=CH2. So, substituting Br at C3 and C4.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the numbering in the substituent. If the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, then the substitution positions are numbered accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is numbered as follows:

1: O attached to CH2 (C1)
2: CH2 (C2)
3: C(CH3)2 (C3)
4: CH=CH2 (C4)

So, positions 3 and 4 in the substituent are C(CH3)2 and CH=CH2.

So, substituting Br at C3 (the C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH=CH2) would give the two products in option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is four carbons, so the substituent's C4 is the end of the chain.

So, substituting Br at C3 and C4 would make sense if the reaction leads to substitution at those positions.

In that case, option D would have the two brominated products.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 and C4, leading to two products.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material has a benzene ring substituted with an ether group (O-) attached to a butenyl chain. The butenyl group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which has the structure:

**Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2**

The reaction with HBr likely proceeds via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. HBr can act as both an acid and a source of Br-. The allylic position (C3 and C4 in the substituent) is susceptible to bromination due to the stabilization provided by the allyl system. The double bond in the substituent allows for the formation of carbocations at allylic positions, which can then react with Br- to form brominated products.

### Key Analysis of the Reaction
1. **Protonation and Double Bond Shift**: The double bond in the substituent can be protonated, leading to the formation of a carbocation. The carbocation can stabilize at the tertiary carbon (C3, C(CH3)2) due to its stability compared to other positions.

2. **Bromination at Allylic Positions**: Br- can attack the carbocation at either C3 (tertiary position) or C4 (secondary position), leading to two distinct products:
   - Substitution at C3 forms **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.
   - Substitution at C4 forms **(3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.

3. **Two Products**: The reaction produces two products because bromination can occur at two different allylic positions (C3 and C4) in the substituent.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of phenols, which would require ether cleavage. This is inconsistent with the reaction conditions and the starting material.
- **Option B**: Proposes one brominated ether and a product with a shifted double bond. This does not align with the expected regioselectivity of the reaction.
- **Option C**: Involves cyclization to form chromane or dihydrobenzofuran structures. While cyclization is possible, it is less likely under the given conditions compared to substitution at allylic positions.
- **Option D**: Indicates two brominated products at C3 and C4, which matches the expected regioselectivity and mechanism of the reaction.

### Conclusion
The reaction proceeds via bromination at the allylic positions (C3 and C4) of the substituent, leading to two products: **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene** and **(3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide, and then seeing what products form. The TLC shows the reactant spot is getting smaller, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction is probably proceeding, and two products are formed.

First, I need to draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other end of the ether is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since butenyl is four carbons, positions 1-4; so positions 3 and 4 are double bonded). Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to C1 of the butenyl group. C1 is CH2, then C2 is CH (with two methyl groups attached?), wait, let me think.

Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on C2 of the butenyl group, there are two methyl groups. So the structure is:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2

Wait, no, because butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-3-yl? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, no. Butenyl groups have four carbons. The numbering is such that the double bond starts at the lower number. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that can't be because that would require four carbons with the double bond at 3-4, but that's not possible because butenyl is only four carbons. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond at 3-4 because that's the end. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of but-3-en-1-yl as CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, that would be but-1-en-3-yl. Hmm, perhaps I should sketch this.

Butenyl group is four carbons. The correct IUPAC name for the substituent in the question is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be, because C3 and C4 would be the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because four carbons can't have a double bond between 3 and 4. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me see: but-3-en-1-yl has the double bond starting at C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4? That would mean CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that would require the third and fourth carbons to be double-bonded. Wait, that's four carbons, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that's the same as between 1 and 2 if you count from the other end. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but the name says but-3-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

Another way: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, wait. Butenyl groups are named as substituents with the substituent's position given. So, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, how? Let me count. Carbon 1: attached to the oxygen. Then, moving away, carbon 2, carbon 3, and carbon 4. So, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, which would be between the second and third CH2 groups. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because 3 and 4 can't have a double bond if it's four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should draw it as the oxygen attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3) group (since it's 2,2-dimethyl), and then a CH2 and a CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: the oxygen is attached to a CH2 group. Then, the next carbon (C2) has two methyl groups (as it's 2,2-dimethyl). So, C2 is CH(CH3)2. Then, C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be: Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's five carbons? No, wait, the butenyl is four carbons. So perhaps it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that's four carbons, so the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is the same as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond in that position because it's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, because the name says but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond starts at C3, which is the third carbon from the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps another approach: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's but-1-en-3-yl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because there's no substituent on C3 or C4 beyond the CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh! That makes sense. So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons in the substituent: the oxygen is attached to CH2 (C1), then C2 is C(CH3)2, then C3 is CH, and C4 is CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's a butenyl group, right? So, yes, the structure would be:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, no, the substituent is butenyl, which is four carbons. So perhaps it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be four carbons, so the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but that's five carbons... No, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense with the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh, wait! That makes sense. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the oxygen is attached to the first carbon (CH2), the second carbon is C(CH3)2, then the third and fourth are CH and CH2, with a double bond between third and fourth. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the molecule is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

Now, the reaction is with hydrogen bromide (HBr). So, what kind of reaction occurs when an ether with a substituted allylic position reacts with HBr? I remember that allylic alcohols can undergo acid-catalyzed bromination, but in this case, the starting material is an ether with an allylic group.

Wait, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed cleavage or addition. Alternatively, maybe it's an electrophilic substitution. Hmm. Let me think: HBr is a strong acid and a source of Br+. The allylic position is susceptible to bromination under certain conditions.

Wait, but in ethers, the adjacent carbons might undergo bromination if there's a possibility of allylic stabilization. So, in this case, the structure around the ether oxygen is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The CH2 next to the oxygen is adjacent to the C(CH3)2, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is between CH and CH2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

When HBr is added, perhaps it protonates the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group? Or maybe the allylic position allows for some kind of bromide attack. Alternatively, considering that the substituent is an allylic ether, maybe it undergoes an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether.

Wait, another option: allylic bromination. The allylic position is next to the double bond. So, in this molecule, the CH2 adjacent to the C(CH3)2 is two carbons away from the double bond. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but the starting material is an ether, and the benzene ring is already substituted. So more likely, it's a reaction on the substituent.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction of allyl ethers with HBr. I recall that allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is that the allylic position undergoes bromination, leading to substitution.

Wait, another thought: when an allyl ether is treated with HBr, it can lead to the formation of allyl bromides via an addition-elimination mechanism. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed bromination of the allylic position, leading to substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the allylic position being susceptible to bromide attack. Since HBr is a source of Br-, maybe the allylic hydrogen is abstracted, forming a carbocation, which then reacts with Br-.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So, the CH2-C(CH3)2 is adjacent to the double bond. The allylic position would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. So, the CH2 groups on either side of the double bond are allylic.

In this case, the CH2 groups on both ends of the double bond would be allylic. So, perhaps the H from the CH2 adjacent to the double bond is abstracted, leading to a carbocation, which then picks up a bromide ion.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the CH2 groups are on C1 (attached to O), C2 (C(CH3)2), then C3 (CH), C4 (CH2). So in the substituent, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the allylic positions are the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4.

Wait, but in this case, the C2 is C(CH3)2, so it's a tertiary carbon. So, if a bromine were to add here, perhaps via allylic bromination, it would form a bromide at that position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the ether cleavage. Under certain conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage, especially if they're allylic or benzylic. But how does that work with HBr?

Wait, another angle: the starting material is an allyl ether. When treated with HBr, which is a strong acid, perhaps the oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, perhaps the adjacent carbon (allylic) could form a carbocation, which could then react with Br-.

Wait, but in the structure, the oxygen is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a C(CH3)2. So, if the ether oxygen is protonated, it becomes O-H+, and the adjacent CH2 could form a carbocation. But the CH2 is attached to a C(CH3)2, so maybe it's not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 could form a more stable carbocation if the double bond can shift.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So, if the CH2 (attached to O) loses a proton, forming a double bond between O and C, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the O could get protonated, making it a better leaving group, leading to cleavage of the ether.

Wait, perhaps the ether cleavage occurs via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. For example, in the presence of H+, the ether oxygen could get protonated, leading to cleavage into two carbocations. But in this case, the oxygen is connected to a CH2 and a benzene ring. So if the O is protonated, perhaps the adjacent C (CH2) could form a carbocation, but that's not very stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the allyl system undergoes some addition. For example, HBr adding across the double bond in an addition reaction. But in that case, the double bond would be protonated, leading to the formation of a bromide on one end and a proton on the other.

Wait, but the starting material has a double bond, so perhaps HBr adds across it, leading to a bromide addition product. But adding HBr to an allyl group would give a bromide at the end. But wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr across the double bond would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, HBr adds across the double bond with anti addition, but perhaps in this case, it's more about allylic bromination.

Wait, another possibility: allylic bromination via the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The allyl system could form a bromonium ion intermediate, leading to bromide attack at the allylic position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but the benzene ring isn't activated in this case. Wait, the substituent is an ether, which is an activating group, but the reaction is with HBr, which is more about electrophilic substitution.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The question states that two new spots appeared, implying two products. So, perhaps the reaction produces two different products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. These are phenols with butyl groups in the 2 and 4 positions. So, perhaps the ether cleavage occurred, replacing the ether with an OH group, but that would require the formation of phenol. Wait, but the starting material is an ether, not an alcohol. How would that happen?

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, one product is a brominated ether, and the other is an ether with a different substituent. Maybe the double bond shifted.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures involve ring formations, perhaps via some cyclization. Chromane is a bicyclic structure, and dihydrobenzofuran suggests a furan ring attached to benzene.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Both are brominated at different positions in the substituent.

Hmm. Let me think about possible reaction mechanisms.

If the starting material is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 and reacts with HBr, perhaps the HBr adds to the double bond. But adding HBr across the double bond would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br, but that seems unlikely because HBr typically adds as H+ to one end and Br- to the other, in a concerted manner. Alternatively, the addition would give Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2Br-CH2. Wait, but that's not correct because the addition would be anti, but in allylic systems, perhaps it's more about bromination.

Wait, another approach: the reaction could involve the formation of a carbocation at the allylic position. The substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. When HBr is added, perhaps the double bond is protonated, leading to the formation of a carbocation at the more stable position.

Wait, if the double bond is between CH and CH2, perhaps the proton adds to the CH, making it CH2, and the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation. For example, adding H to the end of the double bond and then forming a carbocation.

Alternatively, the mechanism could be similar to the acid-catalyzed addition of HBr to an alkene, but in this case, since it's an ether, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the ether. Under acidic conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage. For example, with HBr, the ether O could be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbon would form a carbocation, which could then react with Br-.

But in this structure, the adjacent carbon is CH2, which is attached to a C(CH3)2 group. If the ether oxygen is protonated, the CH2-OH+ could leave as water, forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. But that carbon is CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the O is protonated, it becomes O-H+, and the CH2 could form a carbocation. But the CH2 is next to a C(CH3)2, so perhaps it's not a very stable carbocation. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

If the double bond is between CH and CH2, then adding a proton to the end (CH2) would form a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, which is C(CH3)2. Wait, but that's already a tertiary carbocation (since C(CH3)2 is connected to CH2 and the adjacent carbons). So, if the proton adds to the CH2 group (the end), the double bond shifts to the neighboring carbons, creating a more stable carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the proton adds to the CH2 group, leading the double bond to shift, creating a carbocation on the C(CH3)2.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

1. Protonation of the ether oxygen by HBr, making it O-H+ and adjacent to a CH2 group.

2. The CH2 group becomes a leaving group (water?), forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, which is C(CH3)2.

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary carbon. So, the carbocation would be at C(CH3)2.

Then, Br- could attack this carbocation, leading to substitution at that position.

So, the substituent would become Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because the double bond is still there. Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br occurs at the C(CH3)2 position.

Wait, but the starting substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. After the carbocation forms on C(CH3)2, Br- would attack, leading to Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH=CH2. But that doesn't seem right, as the double bond is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts during the process. For example, after adding H+ to one end, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but the starting double bond is between CH and CH2. If H+ adds to the CH2 end, then the double bond could shift to between C(CH3)2 and the adjacent carbon, which is CH. But that would make the carbocation on C(CH3)2, which is already a tertiary position, so it's stable.

So, the structure after addition would be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br? No, wait. Let me imagine the steps:

Protonation of O:

Ph-OH+ -CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Then, water leaves, forming a carbocation on the CH2 group, which is adjacent to C(CH3)2.

Wait, but that's a primary carbocation (CH2+), which is not very stable. So perhaps the double bond shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

So, the initial structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

After protonation, the double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation. For example, the double bond might shift to between C(CH3)2 and the adjacent CH, making the carbocation on C(CH3)2, which is tertiary and thus more stable.

So, the structure becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2-+CH2-CH2Br ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The initial structure after protonation would have the double bond between C3 and C4. Adding a proton to C4 (the CH2 group), leading to a carbocation at C3. But C3 is CH, so the carbocation would be on C3, which is secondary. Alternatively, the double bond could shift to between C2 and C3, making the carbocation on C2 (which is C(CH3)2), which is tertiary and more stable.

So, the process would be: protonation of the double bond, shift to form a more stable carbocation, then Br- attack.

So, the product would have Br attached to the C(CH3)2 group.

So, the substituent becomes Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2Br-CH2-CH3? No, wait, because the double bond has shifted.

Wait, maybe the product would have a bromine on either C3 or C4, depending on where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution of the oxygen with Br. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring bromination, but that seems less likely.

Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a di-substituted product, such as substitution at two different positions in the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the possible products.

Option D is two products where the bromide is attached at the 3 and 4 positions of the substituent.

Option B has one product where the substituent is brominated at the 4 position, and another where the double bond has shifted.

Option C involves cyclization, which might form a chromane or dihydrobenzofuran structure.

Option A is about the formation of phenols in different positions.

Hmm. Let's consider option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. Chromane is a bicyclic structure with a benzene ring and a cyclohexane ring fused together. Dihydrobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused with a dihydrofuran ring.

How could that form from the starting material? Well, perhaps the substituent (the butenyl group) cyclizes to form a ring. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon in the substituent, leading to ring formation.

Wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the oxygen attacks the CH2 group at the end of the substituent, it would form a five-membered ring (since the substituent is four carbons plus oxygen). Let me count: O connected to CH2, then C(CH3)2, then CH, then CH2. So the substituent is four carbons, so the ring would be five-membered (O, CH2, C(CH3)2, CH, CH2). That would form a cyclohexene oxide or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent forms a ring after bromide attack, leading to a dihydrofuran structure. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon two positions away, forming a five-membered ring.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to an allyl ether, it can lead to ring formation if the substituent is long enough. For example, the oxygen could attack a carbon in the substituent, forming a new ring. This would happen via an acid-catalyzed cyclization.

In this case, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The length is sufficient for a five-membered ring to form. So, the oxygen could attack the CH2 group at the end, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to be long enough. Let's see: O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 is four carbons in the substituent. So the distance from O to the end is four carbons. If the oxygen attacks the end CH2, the ring would be five-membered (O, CH2, C(CH3)2, CH, CH2). That's a five-membered ring, which is favorable.

So, in such a cyclization, the oxygen would form a bond with the end CH2, creating a ring:

Ph
|
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH-CH2-O

Wait, but that would form a five-membered ring, which would create a structure similar to tetrahydrofuran fused to the benzene ring. But in this case, it's a larger ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydrofuran structure.

Wait, but if the oxygen attacks the CH2 at the end, the substituent would form a five-membered ring. Let me imagine:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-O-Ph?

No, that's not possible because it's the same molecule. Alternatively, the substituent forms a ring with the oxygen, leading to a structure like chromane or benzofuran.

Wait, perhaps during the reaction, a hemiacetal-like structure forms, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring via an intramolecular attack, leading to a cyclic ether or similar.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent can form a dihydrofuran ring by cyclization.

Wait, another angle: the starting material's substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If the double bond shifts during the reaction, perhaps to form a more stable carbocation, and then Br- attacks at different positions, leading to different substitution products.

Wait, if the double bond is between C3 and C4 (CH and CH2), and during the reaction, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3 (C(CH3)2 and CH), forming a more stable carbocation at C(CH3)2, which is tertiary. Then, Br- could attack either at C3 or C4, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 or C4, giving two different products.

Looking at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, the bromine is either at position 3 or 4 in the substituent.

In the substituent, positions 3 and 4 are the two ends of the double bond. So, if substitution occurs at either end, that would make sense.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to bromide substitution at either C3 or C4 in the substituent, giving two products.

But wait, the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The positions in the substituent are numbered starting from the oxygen. So, the substituent is:

O (C1) - CH2 (C2) - C(CH3)2 (C3) - CH (C4) = CH2 (C5). Wait, but that would make it a pentenyl group, not butenyl. Hmm, perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should renumber the substituent correctly.

The substituent is (but-3-en-1-yl), which is four carbons. So:

C1: connected to O (CH2)
C2: CH (with two methyl groups)
C3: CH2 (double bond between C3 and C4)
C4: CH2

Wait, no. But but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's but-1-en-3-yl. I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps I should think of it as:

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that would be four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, substituent structure:

C1: CH2 (attached to O)
C2: CH2
C3: CH
C4: CH2 (but double bond between C3 and C4)

But also, there's a 2,2-dimethyl substitution, so C2 has two methyl groups. So, substituent structure:

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Now, when HBr is added, perhaps the H adds to C4 (the end CH2), making the double bond shift to between C2 and C3 (C(CH3)2 and CH). Then, a carbocation forms at C2 (C(CH3)2), which is tertiary. Br- can attack either at C3 (if the double bond shifts) or at another position.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is as follows:

1. Protonation of the double bond at C4 (end CH2), leading to a carbocation at C3 (CH).

2. The carbocation at C3 is not very stable, so the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, forming a more stable carbocation at C2 (C(CH3)2).

3. Br- attacks this carbocation, leading to substitution at C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond doesn't shift, and the bromide attacks at C4, leading to substitution there.

Wait, but the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. If H adds to C4, forming a carbocation at C3 (CH+), which is secondary. That's less stable than a tertiary carbocation, so perhaps the double bond shifts to form a tertiary carbocation.

So, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, making the substituent O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2+.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure becomes O-CH2-C(CH3)2+-CH2-CH2Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps again:

- The substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

- HBr adds H+ to the double bond, leading to the more stable carbocation.

- The double bond could shift to form a more stable carbocation.

- Br- then attacks the carbocation, leading to substitution.

If the H adds to C4 (CH2), the double bond shifts to C2-C3, forming a carbocation at C2 (tertiary), which is more stable. Then, Br- attacks, leading to substitution at C2.

But wait, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding H+ to C4 makes the structure O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2H. Then, the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, making the substituent O-CH2-C(CH3)2+-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because the shift would form a carbocation at C3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Protonation of the double bond (say, at C4) would give O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2H, which is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH3, but that's not possible because the substituent is butenyl, not pentenyl. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that allows for allylic bromination. So, the substituent's double bond is between C3 and C4. The allylic positions are C2 and C4. Wait, but in this case, C2 is already substituted with two methyl groups, making it a tertiary carbon. So, if a bromide is added at C2, it would give a tertiary bromide, which is more stable.

Alternatively, perhaps bromination occurs at C4, leading to a secondary bromide, but that's less favored than the tertiary position.

So, if the reaction leads to substitution at C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, then the product would have Br at that position.

But looking at the options, option D has bromines at positions 3 and 4 in the substituent. Wait, but in the substituent structure, the positions are C1 (O), C2 (CH2), C3 (C(CH3)2), and C4 (CH=CH2). So, the substituent's C3 is the C(CH3)2, and C4 is CH=CH2.

So, substituting at C3 would mean the substituent becomes O-CH2-CBr(CH3)2-CH=CH2. But that's just substitution at C3.

Alternatively, substitution could occur at C4, leading to O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to two possible products depending on where the H and Br add.

But in an allylic system, addition could lead to different regiochemistry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the options, option D has two products where the substituent is brominated at positions 3 and 4. Let's imagine that during the reaction, the bromide ion can attack either at C3 or C4, leading to two products.

But in the substituent, C3 is C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary carbon, and C4 is CH2.

So, the more favorable product would be substitution at C3 (tertiary bromide), but perhaps some substitution at C4 also occurs, leading to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different sites of substitution based on the carbocation formed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent can form two different carbocations, leading to different substitution products. For example, if the double bond shifts to form a carbocation at C3 (tertiary), then substitution at C3 occurs. If the double bond shifts differently, perhaps a less stable carbocation forms, leading to substitution elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, allowing bromide to attack at either end of the double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. 

Looking at the options again, option D is two brominated products at positions 3 and 4. So, substituent becomes O-CH2-CBr(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br? No, that would make it di-substituted. Alternatively, perhaps one product has Br at C3 and another at C4.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. When HBr adds, it could do so in a way that the Br adds to the end of the double bond, leading to substitution at C4. Alternatively, the Br could add to C3, leading to substitution there.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diastereomer or different regioisomers.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could cause the double bond to shift, leading to different substitution positions.

For example, if the double bond shifts, the carbocation could form at C3 or C2, leading to Br substitution at those positions.

But I'm not sure. 

Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a ring structure, as in option C. For example, the oxygen could attack the end of the substituent, forming a five-membered ring. This would require the substituent to have enough length, which it does (four carbons), so the ring would be five-membered, which is favorable.

If the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, and the oxygen attacks the last CH2 group, the ring formed would be O connected to CH2, then C(CH3)2, then CH, then CH2-O. That's a five-membered ring, which is possible.

This would form a structure where the benzene is fused with a dihydrofuran ring, making it 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. And the substituents would be methyl groups from the C(CH3)2.

In option C, one product is 3,3,4-trimethylchromane, which suggests a bicyclic structure where the benzene is fused with a chromane ring. The other product is 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, which has a dihydrofuran ring fused to benzene.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to two different ring formation pathways, leading to the two products in option C.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at two different positions in the substituent, giving two products as in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the ether, leading to substitution of the O with Br, but that would form a bromobenzene derivative, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a phenol and a bromide, as in option A, but that would require cleavage of the ether, which I'm not sure about.

Hmm. Given the options, option D seems plausible if substitution occurs at positions 3 and 4, yielding two brominated products. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the addition of HBr across the double bond, giving two products based on where the addition occurs. However, I'm not sure if that would lead to two products.

Wait, another thought: when HBr adds to a double bond, it typically adds in a concerted manner, leading to a single product (unless there are stereoisomers involved). But in this case, perhaps the substituent's structure allows for different regiochemistry, leading to two different products.

But I'm not well-versed in the exact regiochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide at the allylic position, and since there are two allylic positions (C2 and C4), two products are formed.

Wait, the substituent has two allylic positions: C2 (C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH2). So, if bromination occurs at both positions, you would get two products.

But in this case, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The allylic positions are C2 (C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH2).

So, if HBr adds Br- at C2 and C4, leading to two different products.

But in option D, the substituents are brominated at 3 and 4, which in the substituent structure, 3 is C(CH3)2 and 4 is CH=CH2. So, substituting Br at C3 and C4.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the numbering in the substituent. If the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, then the substitution positions are numbered accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is numbered as follows:

1: O attached to CH2 (C1)
2: CH2 (C2)
3: C(CH3)2 (C3)
4: CH=CH2 (C4)

So, positions 3 and 4 in the substituent are C(CH3)2 and CH=CH2.

So, substituting Br at C3 (the C(CH3)2) and C4 (CH=CH2) would give the two products in option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

But wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is four carbons, so the substituent's C4 is the end of the chain.

So, substituting Br at C3 and C4 would make sense if the reaction leads to substitution at those positions.

In that case, option D would have the two brominated products.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at C3 and C4, leading to two products.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is option D.


The reaction involves treating (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material has a benzene ring substituted with an ether group (O-) attached to a butenyl chain. The butenyl group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which has the structure:

**Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2**

The reaction with HBr likely proceeds via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. HBr can act as both an acid and a source of Br-. The allylic position (C3 and C4 in the substituent) is susceptible to bromination due to the stabilization provided by the allyl system. The double bond in the substituent allows for the formation of carbocations at allylic positions, which can then react with Br- to form brominated products.

### Key Analysis of the Reaction
1. **Protonation and Double Bond Shift**: The double bond in the substituent can be protonated, leading to the formation of a carbocation. The carbocation can stabilize at the tertiary carbon (C3, C(CH3)2) due to its stability compared to other positions.

2. **Bromination at Allylic Positions**: Br- can attack the carbocation at either C3 (tertiary position) or C4 (secondary position), leading to two distinct products:
   - Substitution at C3 forms **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.
   - Substitution at C4 forms **(3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.

3. **Two Products**: The reaction produces two products because bromination can occur at two different allylic positions (C3 and C4) in the substituent.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of phenols, which would require ether cleavage. This is inconsistent with the reaction conditions and the starting material.
- **Option B**: Proposes one brominated ether and a product with a shifted double bond. This does not align with the expected regioselectivity of the reaction.
- **Option C**: Involves cyclization to form chromane or dihydrobenzofuran structures. While cyclization is possible, it is less likely under the given conditions compared to substitution at allylic positions.
- **Option D**: Indicates two brominated products at C3 and C4, which matches the expected regioselectivity and mechanism of the reaction.

### Conclusion
The reaction proceeds via bromination at the allylic positions (C3 and C4) of the substituent, leading to two products: **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene** and **(3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
