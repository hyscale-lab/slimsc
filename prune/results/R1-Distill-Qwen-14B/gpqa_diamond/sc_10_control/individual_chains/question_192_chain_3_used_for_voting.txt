Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine the conductor is like a bigger sphere, and inside it, there's a smaller sphere (the cavity) not exactly at the center because s is the separation. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four different expressions for E. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Okay, I remember this is a problem involving conductors and their induced charges. So when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor will redistribute any charges it has, but since it's uncharged initially, the charges inside must induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the conductor responds. The inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it, since the total charge of the conductor remains zero. Oh wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface then must have +q to keep the conductor's total charge at zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, the conductor is neutral. So yes, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q, because the total conductor's charge is the sum of inner and outer, which must be zero. So that makes sense.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor (since P is outside) depends on the outer charge. But the configuration is a bit tricky because the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is separated by s from the center of the conductor. So the setup isn't symmetric.

Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so a spherical shell. But the cavity isn't at the center, so the induced charges might not be uniform. Hmm.

Wait, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges should redistribute themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor (excluding the cavity) is zero. So the inner surface will have a charge distribution. But how does that affect the field outside?

I think the key here is to model the system as two concentric spheres: the inner cavity (radius r) and the conductor (radius R). But the cavity is shifted, so the inner surface's charge isn't uniformly distributed. But wait, in the case where the cavity is inside a conductor but not centered, the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor would be such that their field cancels the field from the cavity inside the conductor. But since the conductor is a conductor, the field in the conductor material must be zero.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the electric field outside the conductor. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in a way that the external field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Or maybe not, because the cavity isn't centered.

Wait, no. The outer surface of a conducting sphere has its charge distributed uniformly if the charge inside is symmetric. But in this case, the charge inside (the cavity) is asymmetric because the cavity is not centered. So the outer surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so charges can move freely. But wait, the conductor is initially neutral. So with the charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But the placement of that outer charge depends on the shape of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the conductor is a spherical shell of radius R. So even if the cavity is not at the center, the conductor's inner surface must adjust to create an electric field that cancels the field from the charge +q within the conductor material. So the inner surface's induced charges would be such that the field inside the conductor (between R and the inner cavity) is zero.

But perhaps I should use the method of images here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the electric field outside the conductor as being due to the outer charge, which is +q, but the arrangement might complicate things.

Wait, when the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is off-center, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge. The inner surface's charge will be such that, when combined with the charge +q, the field inside the conductor material is zero. So the inner surface must induce a charge distribution that exactly cancels the field from +q inside the conductor.

But how does that affect the electric field outside? The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, as the conductor is neutral. So the external field would be as if all the charge of +q were at the center of the conductor. Or would it?

Wait, no. Because the charge distribution on the outer surface might not be uniform. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of the inner cavity's position, the outer surface would have a symmetric charge distribution. Wait, is that right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so even if the inner cavity is off-center, the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves uniformly. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface must be symmetric regardless of what's inside, right? Because any external field would cause the charges to redistribute until the internal field cancels.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The presence of an inner cavity with an induced charge would influence the distribution on the outer surface, but the outer surface is a conductor and should have a uniform charge distribution if the external field is symmetric. Wait, but in this case, the system is in electrostatic equilibrium, so the electric field inside the conductor's material must be zero. So the inner surface's induced charge creates a field that cancels the field from the +q charge in the cavity within the conductor material. But the outer surface's charge distribution would depend on the shape of the conductor and the presence of the cavity.

Wait, perhaps I should model the conductor as having two parts: the inner surface and the outer surface. The inner surface has a charge of -q, and the outer has +q. The electric field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q, but the distribution might not be uniform because the inner surface is not symmetric. However, the conductor being a sphere, the outer surface must have a uniform distribution because any external symmetry would require it. Wait, no, the outer surface charge distribution depends on the entire situation. If the inner cavity's induced charge is asymmetric, but the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the outer charge still distributes uniformly. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface might still have a uniform charge distribution regardless of the inner cavity's position. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the conductor as a shell with inner radius R1 and outer radius R2. Wait, but in this problem, the conductor is a sphere of radius R, so the shell is at R. The cavity is inside, so its radius is r, and its center is at a distance s from the conductor's center.

Wait, perhaps the cavity is a small sphere of radius r, and it's located a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the center of the cavity is not at the center of the conductor, but shifted by s.

So when we place a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (radius R) will have an induced charge -q. Now, the conductor is uncharged, so the outer surface must have +q.

But because the cavity's center is s away, the inner surface's charge isn't symmetric. So the inner surface's charge density varies with position. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge should still distribute uniformly because any external point would "see" the outer surface as a uniformly charged sphere. Is that correct?

Wait, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere, and the external field depends only on the total charge. So regardless of what's happening inside, the outer surface will distribute its +q charge uniformly because the system is spherically symmetric with respect to the conductor's center. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor. So the field at point P is due to the outer charge, which is +q, located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, which is the same as if P were on a sphere of radius L centered at the conductor's center.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector pointing from the conductor's center to P.

But wait, let's think about the geometry. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the point P is located at a certain position relative to the cavity's center.

Wait, the problem says that the distance of P from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So the displacement from the cavity's center to P has a magnitude l and makes an angle theta with the displacement s (from conductor's center to cavity's center).

Hmm, so the conductor's center is O, the cavity's center is O', separated by s. Point P is at position such that |O' P| = l, and the angle between O' P and O O' is theta. So the displacement vectors are O O' (length s), and O' P (length l), angle theta between them.

So the vector OP is O O' plus O' P: OP = O O' + O' P.

The length of OP is L, which is given. Wait, actually, the problem states that L is the distance from O to P, so OP = L, and O' P = l, with angle theta between O O' and O' P.

Wait, perhaps using the law of cosines. The distance between O and P is L. O to O' is s. O' to P is l. The angle at O' between O' O and O' P is theta.

So, using the law of cosines:

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Wait, no, wait. When considering vectors, OP = OO' + O'P. So the vectors are OO' (length s) and O'P (length l). The angle between OO' and O'P is theta, but when applying the law of cosines, the angle opposite the side we're trying to find is the included angle between the two sides we know.

Wait, no, the law of cosines says c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c.

In this case, OP is the side opposite the angle at O'. The angle at O' is theta. So:

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Wait, is that correct? Because the vector OP is OO' plus O'P. So the angle between OO' and O'P is theta, but in the triangle O-O'-P, the sides are s (OO'), l (O'P), and L (OP). The angle at O' is theta. So the law of cosines would be:

OP² = OO'² + O'P² - 2 * OO' * O'P * cos(theta)

So,

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Hmm. But how does this relate to the electric field? The electric field at P is due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution. So the electric field at any external point would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

Wait a second, that's the shell theorem. The electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge is spherically symmetric, so the field outside depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor.

But wait, in our case, the outer surface has a charge of +q, and the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, some of the options don't have L². Let me look again.

Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Option A: denominator is (l - s cosθ)^2.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2.

Option D: l².

So based on my reasoning, the correct answer should be option B.

But wait a moment, the charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field should be due to that charge. But the position of the charge inside the cavity (shifted by s) might affect the field at point P. Or does it?

Wait, no. The outer surface's charge is +q, and it's distributed uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside is just due to that +q charge at the center, regardless of the position of the inner cavity's charge. So the field at P is only dependent on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

So the answer should be option B.

But wait, what if the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the distribution on the outer surface? Or does the outer surface have a uniform distribution regardless of the inner charge placement because it's a conductor?

No, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is spherical. The inner charge being shifted would affect the inner surface but not the outer, which remains uniform.

So yes, the electric field outside depends only on L, so the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution**:  
   - The conductor is initially uncharged. When $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral overall, must then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of the **shell theorem**, which states that the field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.  
   - Since the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by this charge and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   - The cavity is not centered within the conductor, and the charge $+q$ is placed inside it. However, the outer surface of the conductor remains uniformly charged due to its spherical symmetry. Thus, the position of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - The geometry involving $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ is irrelevant for determining the electric field at $P$, as the field depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$.

4. **Correct Option**:  
   - The electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:  
     $$E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.$$  
   - This matches **Option B**.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect the field outside the conductor due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface.

So, using the law of cosines:

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Wait, no, wait. When considering vectors, OP = OO' + O'P. So the vectors are OO' (length s) and O'P (length l). The angle between OO' and O'P is theta, but when applying the law of cosines, the angle opposite the side we're trying to find is the included angle between the two sides we know.

Wait, no, the law of cosines says c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c.

In this case, OP is the side opposite the angle at O'. The angle at O' is theta. So:

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Wait, is that correct? Because the vector OP is OO' plus O'P. So the angle between OO' and O'P is theta, but in the triangle O-O'-P, the sides are s (OO'), l (O'P), and L (OP). The angle at O' is theta. So the law of cosines would be:

OP² = OO'² + O'P² - 2 * OO' * O'P * cos(theta)

So,

L² = s² + l² - 2 s l cos(theta)

Hmm. But how does this relate to the electric field? The electric field at P is due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

But wait, some of the options don't have L². Let me look again.

Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Option A: denominator is (l - s cosθ)^2.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2.

Option D: l².

So based on my reasoning, the correct answer should be option B.

But wait a moment, the charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field should be due to that charge. But the position of the charge inside the cavity (shifted by s) might affect the field at point P. Or does it?

Wait, no. The outer surface's charge is +q, and it's distributed uniformly because the conductor is a sphere.

No, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is spherical. The inner charge being shifted would affect the inner surface but not the outer, which remains uniform.

So yes, the electric field outside depends only on L, so the correct answer is option B.

The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

     $$E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.$$  
   - This matches **Option B**.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect the field outside the conductor due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface.
