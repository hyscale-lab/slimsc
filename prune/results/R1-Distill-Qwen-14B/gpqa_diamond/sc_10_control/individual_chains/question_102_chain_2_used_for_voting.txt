Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let me try to parse through all the details.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so that should permit the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein from the same mRNA, right? So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same transcript but are separate proteins.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. LoxP stops transcription unless Cre is present to excise the stop cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP, I think it's a mutated site that can't be cut by Cre unless a certain Cre variant is used, like Dre or maybe in a different orientation.

So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP because the stops are in frame. But when Cre is introduced, it should excise the loxP stop cassette, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. Wait, but the lox2272 uses a different recombinase, right? So if the vector is designed with loxP and lox2272, maybe the same Cre won't affect both? Or perhaps the vector is set up so that only one is excised.

Wait, the question says they used a bicistronic vector with lox-Cre. So when Cre is expressed, it would bind to the loxP sites. So the ligand-mCherry would have the loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Cre would excise that, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor-eGFP has a lox2272 cassette. Wait, but Cre can't cut lox2272, unless it's a different Cre. Or maybe I'm mixing up the systems. Oh, wait, I think lox2272 is a variant that requires a different recombinase, like Dre. So if the construct has loxP in one and lox2272 in another, Cre will only excise the loxP, not the lox2272. So, in this case, the ligand should be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor would still be under the stop cassette because Cre can't cut lox2272. Wait, no, wait, the vector is lox-Cre, so it would only affect the loxP sites.

Wait, the way the vector is described: the ligand is at 5', then a stop in a loxP cassette. Then IRES, then the receptor, then a stop in lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed (because of the stop before mCherry), and the receptor is not expressed either (stop before eGFP). Or wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of the entire construct. The first ORF is ligand, then a stop. Then after IRES, the receptor ORF. So the mRNA has both ORFs, but with internal ribosome entry for the receptor.

Wait, no, bicistronic vectors usually have a promoter, then the first ORF, then maybe a RBS, then another ORF, but in this case, it's more complicated. Or perhaps the first ORF is ligand, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, which is under the control of the CBA promoter. Then, downstream, after IRES, the receptor ORF is present with a stop in lox2272.

Wait, maybe the CBA promoter is only for the ligand. Because it's stated that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the mRNA would have the CBA promoter driving the ligand, then a stop, then perhaps the IRES, and then the receptor ORF.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The vector is bicistronic lox-Cre. So the construct will have two ORFs. The first is ligand, which is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Then, after that, there's an IRES, and then the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would not be expressed because there's a stop in the loxP cassette. The receptor would also not be expressed because of the lox2272 stop. Wait, but the CBA promoter is for the ligand. So the mRNA would be ligand-STOP-LOX... IRES-receptor-STOP-LOX2272.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop. So the ribosome would terminate after the ligand, but the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. Wait, no, I think the IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a new ribosome. So the CBA promoter would drive the whole mRNA, which starts with ligand, then after the stop, the IRES would allow the ribosome to switch and start translating the receptor. But if the ligand has a stop, the ribosome would terminate, and the IRES would help recruit the ribosome to the receptor's start codon. So without Cre, the ligand would not be expressed, but the receptor would be expressed, because the IRES allows the receptor to be translated, but the eGFP is behind a stop cassette that Cre can't excise (since it's lox2272). Hmm, but wait, the lox2272 cassette is in the receptor's expression, so the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

But wait, the IRES is after the ligand ORF, which has a stop. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop in lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is in a stop cassette, so it's not expressed. The receptor is after the IRES. So the IRES would allow the translation of the receptor, but since there's a stop in lox2272, the eGFP would not be expressed. So in the absence of Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is lox-Cre. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut. So in the ligand's case, the stop cassette is loxP, so Cre would excise it, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains, so the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would not. Hmm, but in the question, the eGFP isn't showing up in the microscopy. So why?

Wait, the experiment: They transfected the construct into primary astrocytes. They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, and Cre under its control would be expressed in neural crest derivatives.

So, the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. The Cre would excise the loxP stop cassette in the ligand region, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't excise, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Wait, but the question says that after crossing, when they visualize the mice under confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is supposed to be expressed from the receptor construct, but it's not.

Wait, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the selection markers are causing a problem, but the question says the Western blot after transfection showed actin loading, so they're getting proteins.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't properly expressed because the stop is still in place. But in this case, the Cre would only excise the first stop, loxP, not the lox2272. So the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP is behind a stop that Cre can't remove. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor would be expressed. So when they look for eGFP, it's not there.

Wait, but the question is why there's no green signal. The eGFP is supposed to be expressed only if the lox2272 stop is removed. But since the vector uses Cre, which can't cut lox2272, the eGFP remains under the stop cassette. So the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But another thing to think about: the vector is designed with the ligand and receptor, and when you cross into SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the loxP stop in the ligand, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. So in neural crest cells, where SOX10 is active, the Cre is expressed, leading to the ligand and mCherry being expressed. But the receptor would be expressed but without eGFP.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are overexpressed, but in the mouse model, the construct is under a certain promoter.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong and constitutive. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor might not be, because Cre doesn't affect the lox2272.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the construct is designed so that the ligand is first, then the receptor is on the same transcript, using the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed (due to loxP stop), but the receptor is expressed because the IRES allows it. So when Cre is present, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor would still not be, because the stop after the receptor is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor isn't (since stop remains), so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, and the blot shows the proteins proportional to actin. So presumably, the ligand and receptor were expressed, but in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But let me think about the question again. The mouse is homozygous for the construct in wt background. Then crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, where SOX10 is active, Cre is expressed, which excises the loxP stop in the ligand, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't excise, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But the question says that when you look for the green signal (eGFP), it's not present. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Wait, but the question is about the interaction between the ligand and receptor. So perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, or it's expressed but not functional.

Wait, but the construct was transfected into the mouse, so perhaps the expression is in a specific tissue. SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed in those cells.

Wait, but the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So the receptor is expressed without eGFP, right? So when the researchers visualize the mice, they look for eGFP, but it's not there because the stop cassette is still in place. But then why would they expect eGFP to be expressed?

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the eGFP should be expressed. But in the experiment, it's not. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't directly explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so fluorescence won't be seen. But why would that happen? Maybe if the construct is misfolded, but the question doesn't point towards that.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES. So perhaps the issue is expression, but the Western blot suggests that expression is okay.

D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, if the stop is in the same reading frame, then the eGFP would be in frame and expressed. But wait, the stop is in a stop cassette, which is a loxP-stop-loxP. So the stop is after the receptor ORF. So the eGFP is after that, but with a stop. So the lox2272 cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, meaning that without excision, the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. But if the construct is designed correctly, upon Cre excision, only the loxP stop is removed. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are still under the lox2272 stop. So, the eGFP is not expressed.

Wait, but the question is why there's no green signal. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. But why would that be the case?

Wait, looking back, the vector uses lox-Cre. So the Cre can only excise the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites can't be excised by Cre, so the eGFP remains under the stop.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), so the ligand is expressed. The receptor is on the same construct, but the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is still present. So when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. But why is that a problem? Because the question is about the interaction between ligand and receptor. Maybe they intended to have the eGFP as a reporter for the receptor's expression. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, they can't see the receptor's expression.

But according to the setup, the construct is correctly designed, with the eGFP only expressed when the lox2272 is excised, which requires a different recombinase. So in the absence of that, eGFP isn't expressed. So why would they expect it to be expressed?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the vector setup. Let me think again.

The vector is bicistronic, with the ligand (5') under CBA promoter, then a stop in loxP. Then IRES, then the receptor (with eGFP at the C-terminus), then a stop in lox2272.

So without Cre, the ligand is not expressed (because of the stop). The receptor is expressed because the IRES allows it, but eGFP is not expressed because of the lox2272 stop.

With Cre, the loxP stop is excised, so ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not, because the lox2272 stop remains.

So in the mouse model, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. But why is the question stating that they don't observe a green signal? Maybe they expected eGFP to be expressed, but it's not. So why isn't it expressed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not working. If the IRES is not functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But the question states that the Western blot after transfection showed expression, so the IRES is working.

Wait, another possibility: the vectors were designed such that both the ligand and receptor require Cre to be expressed. But in that case, the ligand would require Cre to remove the loxP stop, and the receptor would require something else. But the question says the mouse isn't expressing eGFP, perhaps because the Cre isn't working. But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest cells.

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is under the control of the same promoter as the receptor. So if the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP isn't either. But why wouldn't the receptor be expressed? If the IRES isn't working, but the Western blot suggests expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the stop is in the same frame, then the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would be a separate ORF after the stop. But that's not possible because the stop would terminate the receptor's expression.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly expressed. But that would relate to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

But in this case, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which is after the receptor. So the eGFP is not expressed unless the stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame, but the stop is in a way that prevents expression. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is still in place.

But why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the lox2272 can't be cut by Cre. So the mouse model doesn't have eGFP expressed, hence no green signal.

But the question is asking why the eGFP isn't expressed. The possible answer is that the stop is still present because the lox2272 wasn't excised, which requires a different recombinase. But the options don't directly mention that.

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, perhaps the expression is not correct. But in our case, the eGFP is after the stop; without the stop being excised, it's not expressed. So this doesn't directly answer the question.

Another option: perhaps the receptor is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working. But the Western blot suggests that it's expressed.

Wait, the fact that they don't see any green signal could also be because the eGFP isn't being expressed because the IRES is not allowing the receptor to be translated, but that doesn't seem right because the Western blot would have shown the proteins.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the vector has a stop before it, and Cre isn't present to remove it. But in this case, the Cre is present because of the SOX10-Cre mice.

Wait, but the Cre is under the control of SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre should be active there, and excise the loxP stop in the ligand, but not the lox2272 in the receptor.

So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor's eGFP wouldn't. So why would they not see the eGFP signal? Because the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the ligand and receptor constructs. So when Cre is expressed, both alleles would have the loxP stop cassette removed for the ligand, but the lox2272 remains.

So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

But the question is about why there's no green signal. The possible answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't removed. But none of the options directly state that. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so fluorescence wouldn't be detected. But I don't see why the construct would be stuck there; perhaps because of incorrect signal peptides or something, but the question doesn't suggest this.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so an enhancer might not be needed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a strong enough promoter.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is out of frame, it wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the stop is before the eGFP, so even if in frame, it wouldn't be expressed. So this might not be the correct reason.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor. So in the absence of the stop removal, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would that happen? Because the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272, which it can't. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the vector's design prevents it.

Wait, looking back at the initial construct design: the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, with a stop in loxP. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus, with a stop in lox2272. So the eGFP is downstream of the receptor.

In this setup, the Cre only cuts the loxP sites. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. The receptor's stop remains because it's in lox2272, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't address this directly.

Wait, but the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. The correct answer would be that the stop isn't removed. But none of the options say that. Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, perhaps it's not expressed, but that's unrelated to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 cassette isn't being cut, so the stop remains. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the real issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, because the stop is in the same frame, causing the expression to terminate before eGFP.

Wait, but the eGFP is in a separate ORF. The stop is after the receptor. So if the stop is in the same frame, then the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP's ORF would not be read. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is in the same frame, preventing the reading of eGFP.

But that would relate to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're in the same frame, the eGFP would be expressed, but if not, then it isn't.

Wait, but the way it's designed, the eGFP is in a separate ORF. So the stop is after the receptor. The eGFP is in a separate ORF, so the frame shouldn't affect it. Unless the stop is in a way that disrupts the eGFP's ORF.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The question is why there's no green signal. The most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't being cut. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP's ORF isn't correctly translated. But if the stop is still present, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is present, but the real issue is that the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, preventing eGFP from being expressed. So the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, which would mean that when the stop is in the same frame, the receptor is terminated, and eGFP isn't expressed. But that doesn't make sense because eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF, but without the stop being removed, it isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have that.

If I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they are in the same frame, the eGFP would be expressed, but if they're not, then the eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the end of the receptor's ORF, so they should be in frame. So if they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the receptor is expressed, the eGFP isn't. But that's unrelated to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette is in the same frame, meaning that the eGFP's ORF isn't accessible.

I think I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The construct has the ligand with a loxP stop, which Cre can excise. The receptor has a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't. So in the presence of Cre, ligand is expressed, receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So after crossing to SOX10-Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP, it's not there. So why? Because the eGFP's stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly address this. The only option that relates to expression is option C, which talks about an enhancer being missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so enhancer may not be the issue.

Wait, the question says the construct was transfected into primary astrocytes and the Western blot showed expression. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the IRES is working, and the receptor is expressed, but in the mouse model, it's not? No, because the mouse model should have the same construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed as a fusion with the receptor, and if they're not in frame, the fusion isn't correct. But that doesn't directly relate to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being translated because of the stop. So the correct answer is that the stop remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. But since the options don't directly state this, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their co-expression.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi, meaning it's not on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? Unless the eGFP is part of a secreted protein or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the same frame, causing the receptor to terminate early, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, option D.

But I'm really not sure. If I have to choose, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element.
   - In the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed due to the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor may still be expressed via the IRES.
   - In the presence of Cre (e.g., from SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is excised, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. However, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette cannot be excised by Cre, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

2. **Observed Outcome**:
   - After crossing with SOX10-Cre mice, the ligand is expressed (as confirmed by the Western blot), but no green signal (eGFP) is observed. This suggests that eGFP is not being expressed.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This describes the functional interaction between ligand and receptor but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. **Not relevant.**
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: If the receptor-eGFP construct were misfolded or retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, there is no evidence in the question to suggest such a trafficking issue. **Unlikely.**
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which is sufficient for expression. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing. **Unlikely.**
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be properly expressed as a fusion protein. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is missing, as the stop cassette prevents its expression. **Most plausible explanation.**

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame, preventing proper eGFP expression. This explanation is consistent with the construct design and the observed outcome.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let me try to parse through all the details.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so that should permit the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein from the same mRNA, right? So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same transcript but are separate proteins.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. LoxP stops transcription unless Cre is present to excise the stop cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP, I think it's a mutated site that can't be cut by Cre unless a certain Cre variant is used, like Dre or maybe in a different orientation.

So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP because the stops are in frame. But when Cre is introduced, it should excise the loxP stop cassette, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. Wait, but the lox2272 uses a different recombinase, right? So if the vector is designed with loxP and lox2272, maybe the same Cre won't affect both? Or perhaps the vector is set up so that only one is excised.

Wait, the question says they used a bicistronic vector with lox-Cre. So when Cre is expressed, it would bind to the loxP sites. So the ligand-mCherry would have the loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Cre would excise that, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor-eGFP has a lox2272 cassette. Wait, but Cre can't cut lox2272, unless it's a different Cre. Or maybe I'm mixing up the systems. Oh, wait, I think lox2272 is a variant that requires a different recombinase, like Dre. So if the construct has loxP in one and lox2272 in another, Cre will only excise the loxP, not the lox2272. So, in this case, the ligand should be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor would still be under the stop cassette because Cre can't cut lox2272. Wait, no, wait, the vector is lox-Cre, so it would only affect the loxP sites.

Wait, the way the vector is described: the ligand is at 5', then a stop in a loxP cassette. Then IRES, then the receptor, then a stop in lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed (because of the stop before mCherry), and the receptor is not expressed either (stop before eGFP). Or wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of the entire construct. The first ORF is ligand, then a stop. Then after IRES, the receptor ORF. So the mRNA has both ORFs, but with internal ribosome entry for the receptor.

Wait, no, bicistronic vectors usually have a promoter, then the first ORF, then maybe a RBS, then another ORF, but in this case, it's more complicated. Or perhaps the first ORF is ligand, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, which is under the control of the CBA promoter. Then, downstream, after IRES, the receptor ORF is present with a stop in lox2272.

Wait, maybe the CBA promoter is only for the ligand. Because it's stated that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the mRNA would have the CBA promoter driving the ligand, then a stop, then perhaps the IRES, and then the receptor ORF.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The vector is bicistronic lox-Cre. So the construct will have two ORFs. The first is ligand, which is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Then, after that, there's an IRES, and then the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would not be expressed because there's a stop in the loxP cassette. The receptor would also not be expressed because of the lox2272 stop. Wait, but the CBA promoter is for the ligand. So the mRNA would be ligand-STOP-LOX... IRES-receptor-STOP-LOX2272.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop. So the ribosome would terminate after the ligand, but the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. Wait, no, I think the IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a new ribosome. So the CBA promoter would drive the whole mRNA, which starts with ligand, then after the stop, the IRES would allow the ribosome to switch and start translating the receptor. But if the ligand has a stop, the ribosome would terminate, and the IRES would help recruit the ribosome to the receptor's start codon. So without Cre, the ligand would not be expressed, but the receptor would be expressed, because the IRES allows the receptor to be translated, but the eGFP is behind a stop cassette that Cre can't excise (since it's lox2272). Hmm, but wait, the lox2272 cassette is in the receptor's expression, so the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

But wait, the IRES is after the ligand ORF, which has a stop. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop in lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is in a stop cassette, so it's not expressed. The receptor is after the IRES. So the IRES would allow the translation of the receptor, but since there's a stop in lox2272, the eGFP would not be expressed. So in the absence of Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is lox-Cre. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut. So in the ligand's case, the stop cassette is loxP, so Cre would excise it, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains, so the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would not. Hmm, but in the question, the eGFP isn't showing up in the microscopy. So why?

Wait, the experiment: They transfected the construct into primary astrocytes. They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, and Cre under its control would be expressed in neural crest derivatives.

So, the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. The Cre would excise the loxP stop cassette in the ligand region, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't excise, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Wait, but the question says that after crossing, when they visualize the mice under confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is supposed to be expressed from the receptor construct, but it's not.

Wait, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the selection markers are causing a problem, but the question says the Western blot after transfection showed actin loading, so they're getting proteins.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't properly expressed because the stop is still in place. But in this case, the Cre would only excise the first stop, loxP, not the lox2272. So the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP is behind a stop that Cre can't remove. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor would be expressed. So when they look for eGFP, it's not there.

Wait, but the question is why there's no green signal. The eGFP is supposed to be expressed only if the lox2272 stop is removed. But since the vector uses Cre, which can't cut lox2272, the eGFP remains under the stop cassette. So the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But another thing to think about: the vector is designed with the ligand and receptor, and when you cross into SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the loxP stop in the ligand, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. So in neural crest cells, where SOX10 is active, the Cre is expressed, leading to the ligand and mCherry being expressed. But the receptor would be expressed but without eGFP.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are overexpressed, but in the mouse model, the construct is under a certain promoter.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong and constitutive. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor might not be, because Cre doesn't affect the lox2272.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the construct is designed so that the ligand is first, then the receptor is on the same transcript, using the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed (due to loxP stop), but the receptor is expressed because the IRES allows it. So when Cre is present, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor would still not be, because the stop after the receptor is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor isn't (since stop remains), so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, and the blot shows the proteins proportional to actin. So presumably, the ligand and receptor were expressed, but in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But let me think about the question again. The mouse is homozygous for the construct in wt background. Then crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, where SOX10 is active, Cre is expressed, which excises the loxP stop in the ligand, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't excise, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But the question says that when you look for the green signal (eGFP), it's not present. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Wait, but the question is about the interaction between the ligand and receptor. So perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, or it's expressed but not functional.

Wait, but the construct was transfected into the mouse, so perhaps the expression is in a specific tissue. SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed in those cells.

Wait, but the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So the receptor is expressed without eGFP, right? So when the researchers visualize the mice, they look for eGFP, but it's not there because the stop cassette is still in place. But then why would they expect eGFP to be expressed?

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the eGFP should be expressed. But in the experiment, it's not. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't directly explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so fluorescence won't be seen. But why would that happen? Maybe if the construct is misfolded, but the question doesn't point towards that.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES. So perhaps the issue is expression, but the Western blot suggests that expression is okay.

D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, if the stop is in the same reading frame, then the eGFP would be in frame and expressed. But wait, the stop is in a stop cassette, which is a loxP-stop-loxP. So the stop is after the receptor ORF. So the eGFP is after that, but with a stop. So the lox2272 cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, meaning that without excision, the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. But if the construct is designed correctly, upon Cre excision, only the loxP stop is removed. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are still under the lox2272 stop. So, the eGFP is not expressed.

Wait, but the question is why there's no green signal. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. But why would that be the case?

Wait, looking back, the vector uses lox-Cre. So the Cre can only excise the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites can't be excised by Cre, so the eGFP remains under the stop.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), so the ligand is expressed. The receptor is on the same construct, but the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is still present. So when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. But why is that a problem? Because the question is about the interaction between ligand and receptor. Maybe they intended to have the eGFP as a reporter for the receptor's expression. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, they can't see the receptor's expression.

But according to the setup, the construct is correctly designed, with the eGFP only expressed when the lox2272 is excised, which requires a different recombinase. So in the absence of that, eGFP isn't expressed. So why would they expect it to be expressed?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the vector setup. Let me think again.

The vector is bicistronic, with the ligand (5') under CBA promoter, then a stop in loxP. Then IRES, then the receptor (with eGFP at the C-terminus), then a stop in lox2272.

So without Cre, the ligand is not expressed (because of the stop). The receptor is expressed because the IRES allows it, but eGFP is not expressed because of the lox2272 stop.

With Cre, the loxP stop is excised, so ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not, because the lox2272 stop remains.

So in the mouse model, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. But why is the question stating that they don't observe a green signal? Maybe they expected eGFP to be expressed, but it's not. So why isn't it expressed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not working. If the IRES is not functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But the question states that the Western blot after transfection showed expression, so the IRES is working.

Wait, another possibility: the vectors were designed such that both the ligand and receptor require Cre to be expressed. But in that case, the ligand would require Cre to remove the loxP stop, and the receptor would require something else. But the question says the mouse isn't expressing eGFP, perhaps because the Cre isn't working. But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest cells.

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is under the control of the same promoter as the receptor. So if the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP isn't either. But why wouldn't the receptor be expressed? If the IRES isn't working, but the Western blot suggests expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the stop is in the same frame, then the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would be a separate ORF after the stop. But that's not possible because the stop would terminate the receptor's expression.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly expressed. But that would relate to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

But in this case, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which is after the receptor. So the eGFP is not expressed unless the stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame, but the stop is in a way that prevents expression. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is still in place.

But why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the lox2272 can't be cut by Cre. So the mouse model doesn't have eGFP expressed, hence no green signal.

But the question is asking why the eGFP isn't expressed. The possible answer is that the stop is still present because the lox2272 wasn't excised, which requires a different recombinase. But the options don't directly mention that.

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, perhaps the expression is not correct. But in our case, the eGFP is after the stop; without the stop being excised, it's not expressed. So this doesn't directly answer the question.

Another option: perhaps the receptor is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working. But the Western blot suggests that it's expressed.

Wait, the fact that they don't see any green signal could also be because the eGFP isn't being expressed because the IRES is not allowing the receptor to be translated, but that doesn't seem right because the Western blot would have shown the proteins.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the vector has a stop before it, and Cre isn't present to remove it. But in this case, the Cre is present because of the SOX10-Cre mice.

Wait, but the Cre is under the control of SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre should be active there, and excise the loxP stop in the ligand, but not the lox2272 in the receptor.

So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor's eGFP wouldn't. So why would they not see the eGFP signal? Because the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the ligand and receptor constructs. So when Cre is expressed, both alleles would have the loxP stop cassette removed for the ligand, but the lox2272 remains.

So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

But the question is about why there's no green signal. The possible answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't removed. But none of the options directly state that. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so fluorescence wouldn't be detected. But I don't see why the construct would be stuck there; perhaps because of incorrect signal peptides or something, but the question doesn't suggest this.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so an enhancer might not be needed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a strong enough promoter.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is out of frame, it wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the stop is before the eGFP, so even if in frame, it wouldn't be expressed. So this might not be the correct reason.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor. So in the absence of the stop removal, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would that happen? Because the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272, which it can't. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the vector's design prevents it.

Wait, looking back at the initial construct design: the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, with a stop in loxP. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus, with a stop in lox2272. So the eGFP is downstream of the receptor.

In this setup, the Cre only cuts the loxP sites. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. The receptor's stop remains because it's in lox2272, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't address this directly.

Wait, but the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. The correct answer would be that the stop isn't removed. But none of the options say that. Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, perhaps it's not expressed, but that's unrelated to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 cassette isn't being cut, so the stop remains. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the real issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, because the stop is in the same frame, causing the expression to terminate before eGFP.

Wait, but the eGFP is in a separate ORF. The stop is after the receptor. So if the stop is in the same frame, then the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP's ORF would not be read. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is in the same frame, preventing the reading of eGFP.

But that would relate to option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're in the same frame, the eGFP would be expressed, but if not, then it isn't.

Wait, but the way it's designed, the eGFP is in a separate ORF. So the stop is after the receptor. The eGFP is in a separate ORF, so the frame shouldn't affect it. Unless the stop is in a way that disrupts the eGFP's ORF.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The question is why there's no green signal. The most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't being cut. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP's ORF isn't correctly translated. But if the stop is still present, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is present, but the real issue is that the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, preventing eGFP from being expressed. So the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, which would mean that when the stop is in the same frame, the receptor is terminated, and eGFP isn't expressed. But that doesn't make sense because eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF, but without the stop being removed, it isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have that.

If I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they are in the same frame, the eGFP would be expressed, but if they're not, then the eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the end of the receptor's ORF, so they should be in frame. So if they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the receptor is expressed, the eGFP isn't. But that's unrelated to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette is in the same frame, meaning that the eGFP's ORF isn't accessible.

I think I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The construct has the ligand with a loxP stop, which Cre can excise. The receptor has a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't. So in the presence of Cre, ligand is expressed, receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So after crossing to SOX10-Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So when they look for eGFP, it's not there. So why? Because the eGFP's stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly address this. The only option that relates to expression is option C, which talks about an enhancer being missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so enhancer may not be the issue.

Wait, the question says the construct was transfected into primary astrocytes and the Western blot showed expression. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the IRES is working, and the receptor is expressed, but in the mouse model, it's not? No, because the mouse model should have the same construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed as a fusion with the receptor, and if they're not in frame, the fusion isn't correct. But that doesn't directly relate to the stop cassette.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being translated because of the stop. So the correct answer is that the stop remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. But since the options don't directly state this, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their co-expression.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi, meaning it's not on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? Unless the eGFP is part of a secreted protein or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the same frame, causing the receptor to terminate early, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, option D.

But I'm really not sure. If I have to choose, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element.
   - In the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed due to the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor may still be expressed via the IRES.
   - In the presence of Cre (e.g., from SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is excised, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. However, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette cannot be excised by Cre, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

2. **Observed Outcome**:
   - After crossing with SOX10-Cre mice, the ligand is expressed (as confirmed by the Western blot), but no green signal (eGFP) is observed. This suggests that eGFP is not being expressed.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This describes the functional interaction between ligand and receptor but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. **Not relevant.**
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: If the receptor-eGFP construct were misfolded or retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, there is no evidence in the question to suggest such a trafficking issue. **Unlikely.**
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which is sufficient for expression. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing. **Unlikely.**
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be properly expressed as a fusion protein. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is missing, as the stop cassette prevents its expression. **Most plausible explanation.**

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame, preventing proper eGFP expression. This explanation is consistent with the construct design and the observed outcome.

**Answer: D**
