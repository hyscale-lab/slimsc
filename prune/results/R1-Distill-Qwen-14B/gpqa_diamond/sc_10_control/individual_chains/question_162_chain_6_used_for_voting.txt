Okay, so I've got this question about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll give it a shot.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx and dy terms. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional space embedded in some higher-dimensional space, or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space or something like that.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in this case, I think we're talking about the metric itself. So perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere, and we need to compute its area.

Wait, but wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, but it's a 2D metric. So the space is two-dimensional, and the area would be the integral over this space of the square root of the determinant of the metric times dx dy, but actually, wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

Let me write down the metric properly. The given metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. Because it's diagonal. So the determinant of the metric is g_xx * g_yy, since it's diagonal. So det(g) = [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, so the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero, it's sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. Which is sqrt([32/(4 - r²)]²) dx dy. That's (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy, but wait, this is a 2D metric, so perhaps it's a surface in 3D space? Or is it a model space?

Wait, wait. The question says it's the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe r is the radius of the pseudosphere, but I'm not sure how that connects to the metric given. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a pseudosphere, and the radius here is r=2.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the metric as a model for a pseudosphere. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric singular there. So the space is only defined where x² + y² <4, so r <2.

Wait, because 4 is (2)^2. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But the metric is singular at r=2, so that might be the edge of the pseudosphere.

But wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in 2D, the metric of a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) can be written in isothermal coordinates. Wait, the given metric has the form E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function of x² + y². That's similar to what's called an isothermal coordinate system, which is a conformal metric.

The standard form for hyperbolic space in isothermal coordinates is ds² = (4a²)/(x² + y² + a²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where a is the curvature radius. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, another parameterization for hyperbolic space is using the Poincaré disk model. The metric for the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4 dx²)/( (1 - (x² + y²))^2 ), where the radius of the disk is 1. So in this case, the curvature is negative, and the area is finite.

Wait, but in our given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So if I factor out the 4, it becomes 4 - (x² + y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/(4)).

So the metric can be rewritten as ds² = (32)/(4 (1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) ) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Wait, but the standard Poincaré disk metric is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Or, in terms of x and y, since r² = x² + y², as in our metric.

Wait, our metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²) = (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, so comparing this to the standard Poincaré disk, which is (4)/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but our metric is in terms of dx and dy, so let's see:

In our case, E = 8/(1 - (r²)/4), where r² = x² + y². So E is 8/(1 - (r²)/4)^1, but the standard Poincaré is 4/(1 - r²)^2. So the exponents don't match. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic space with a different curvature. Let me think about the Gaussian curvature. For a metric in the form ds² = e^{2λ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{2λ} ( (1/r)(d/dr)(r e^{-2λ}) ) ).

Wait, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, in the isothermal form, the metric is ds² = (4a²)/(x² + y² + a²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where a is related to the curvature. But this doesn't match our given metric either.

Wait, maybe I should directly compute the area. The area would be the integral over the region, which is x² + y² <4, of the area element. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since the metric is diagonal, sqrt(g) is just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy), which is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So dA = [32 / (4 - r²)] dx dy.

But to compute the area, I need to integrate this over x and y such that x² + y² <4. So in polar coordinates, r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral.

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The angular integral is 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-32/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is (-16) ∫ (1/u) du. The limits change: from u=4 to u=0. So when we switch the limits, the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=4, which would make it positive.

Wait, let me do that substitution again:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du = 32*(-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

But integrating from 4 to 0 would be [ln(0) - ln(4)], but ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that's a problem. Because the integral would be diverging.

So the integral ∫0^2 [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] becomes ∫0^4 [32 * (r dr)/(4 - r²)] = something that goes to infinity.

Wait, but let me see. When r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes very large. So the integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. Let's change variables to u =4 - r².

∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ) ].

As before, substituting u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ ( - du/2 ) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Now, the limits are from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes -16 [ -infty - ln4 ] → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. A pseudosphere should have finite area, right? Or wait, perhaps not. Wait, no, a pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature and has finite area. Wait, but that's the surface area, not the area in the embedded space.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the area in the metric and the area of the surface in 3D space. Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided isn't that of a pseudosphere, but something else.

Wait, the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps the pseudosphere's area is being computed, but the metric given is in 2D. Hmm, but a pseudosphere is a 2D surface, right? So maybe the area of the pseudosphere is what we're computing, which would be the area in this metric.

Wait, but from the integral, we saw that the area is infinite because the integrand becomes singular at r=2. That would imply that the area is infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, that can't be right. A pseudosphere should be a finite area. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a finite area. For example, when the radius is a, the area is π a². Wait, no, that's the area in the Poincaré disk model? Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. Oh wait, no! Because in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented in a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because as you approach the boundary, the area element increases rapidly. So the area is indeed infinite.

Wait, but a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite surface. So perhaps the metric in the question is not that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. Hmm, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the metric is that of a sphere, but in pseudo-Riemannian terms. But no, a pseudosphere is a 2D surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. The area of a pseudosphere in its own metric is finite. For example, the tractricoid has finite area, but I'm not sure of the exact value. 

Wait, but in the metric given, the area seems to be diverging. So perhaps the answer is D) +infty. But that would mean the area is infinite, which contradicts my earlier thought about the pseudosphere's area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the metric again. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, so sqrt(det g) = 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But when you integrate this over the entire disk (r <2), the integral becomes infinite because the integrand behaves like 1/(4- r²) near r=2. So the integral ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr. Let me compute this again:

Integrate (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me do substitution: Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln|u| + C. Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the integral is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (-16)(-infty - ln4) = (-16)(-infty) → positive infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, a pseudosphere's area is finite. So why is this metric giving an infinite area? Maybe because it's not a compact space. Wait, the pseudosphere is a compact surface, so its area should be finite.

Ah, perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2, so perhaps the metric is not that of a compact surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again: the given metric is in 2D, so it's a 2D space. The standard pseudosphere (tractricoid) is an immersed surface in 3D space, but its induced metric would be a 2D metric with finite area.

Wait, but the question gives a 2D metric, so perhaps it's representing the entire hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. So the area is infinite, so option D) is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element in this metric. The metric is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det(g) = g_{xx} \cdot g_{yy} = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( \theta \) from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Switching the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

This result aligns with the fact that the given metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. While a pseudosphere (e.g., the tractricoid) is a compact surface with finite area, the metric provided does not describe a compact pseudosphere but rather an infinite hyperbolic plane.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

Okay, so I've got this question about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll give it a shot.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx and dy terms. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional space embedded in some higher-dimensional space, or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space or something like that.

But in this case, I think we're talking about the metric itself. So perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere, and we need to compute its area.

Wait, but wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, but it's a 2D metric. So the space is two-dimensional, and the area would be the integral over this space of the square root of the determinant of the metric times dx dy, but actually, wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

Let me write down the metric properly. The given metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. Because it's diagonal. So the determinant of the metric is g_xx * g_yy, since it's diagonal. So det(g) = [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, so the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero, it's sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. Which is sqrt([32/(4 - r²)]²) dx dy. That's (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy, but wait, this is a 2D metric, so perhaps it's a surface in 3D space? Or is it a model space?

Wait, wait. The question says it's the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe r is the radius of the pseudosphere, but I'm not sure how that connects to the metric given. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a pseudosphere, and the radius here is r=2.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the metric as a model for a pseudosphere. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric singular there. So the space is only defined where x² + y² <4, so r <2.

Wait, because 4 is (2)^2. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But the metric is singular at r=2, so that might be the edge of the pseudosphere.

But wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in 2D, the metric of a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) can be written in isothermal coordinates. Wait, the given metric has the form E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function of x² + y². That's similar to what's called an isothermal coordinate system, which is a conformal metric.

The standard form for hyperbolic space in isothermal coordinates is ds² = (4a²)/(x² + y² + a²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where a is the curvature radius. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, another parameterization for hyperbolic space is using the Poincaré disk model. The metric for the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4 dx²)/( (1 - (x² + y²))^2 ), where the radius of the disk is 1. So in this case, the curvature is negative, and the area is finite.

Wait, but in our given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So if I factor out the 4, it becomes 4 - (x² + y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/(4)).

So the metric can be rewritten as ds² = (32)/(4 (1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) ) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Wait, but the standard Poincaré disk metric is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Or, in terms of x and y, since r² = x² + y², as in our metric.

Wait, our metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²) = (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, so comparing this to the standard Poincaré disk, which is (4)/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but our metric is in terms of dx and dy, so let's see:

In our case, E = 8/(1 - (r²)/4), where r² = x² + y². So E is 8/(1 - (r²)/4)^1, but the standard Poincaré is 4/(1 - r²)^2. So the exponents don't match. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic space with a different curvature. Let me think about the Gaussian curvature. For a metric in the form ds² = e^{2λ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{2λ} ( (1/r)(d/dr)(r e^{-2λ}) ) ).

Wait, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, in the isothermal form, the metric is ds² = (4a²)/(x² + y² + a²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where a is related to the curvature. But this doesn't match our given metric either.

Wait, maybe I should directly compute the area. The area would be the integral over the region, which is x² + y² <4, of the area element. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since the metric is diagonal, sqrt(g) is just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy), which is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So dA = [32 / (4 - r²)] dx dy.

But to compute the area, I need to integrate this over x and y such that x² + y² <4. So in polar coordinates, r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral.

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The angular integral is 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-32/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is (-16) ∫ (1/u) du. The limits change: from u=4 to u=0. So when we switch the limits, the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=4, which would make it positive.

Wait, let me do that substitution again:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du = 32*(-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

But integrating from 4 to 0 would be [ln(0) - ln(4)], but ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that's a problem. Because the integral would be diverging.

So the integral ∫0^2 [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] becomes ∫0^4 [32 * (r dr)/(4 - r²)] = something that goes to infinity.

Wait, but let me see. When r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes very large. So the integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. Let's change variables to u =4 - r².

∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ) ].

As before, substituting u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ ( - du/2 ) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Now, the limits are from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes -16 [ -infty - ln4 ] → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. A pseudosphere should have finite area, right? Or wait, perhaps not. Wait, no, a pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature and has finite area. Wait, but that's the surface area, not the area in the embedded space.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the area in the metric and the area of the surface in 3D space. Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided isn't that of a pseudosphere, but something else.

Wait, the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps the pseudosphere's area is being computed, but the metric given is in 2D. Hmm, but a pseudosphere is a 2D surface, right? So maybe the area of the pseudosphere is what we're computing, which would be the area in this metric.

Wait, but from the integral, we saw that the area is infinite because the integrand becomes singular at r=2. That would imply that the area is infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, that can't be right. A pseudosphere should be a finite area. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a finite area. For example, when the radius is a, the area is π a². Wait, no, that's the area in the Poincaré disk model? Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. Oh wait, no! Because in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented in a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because as you approach the boundary, the area element increases rapidly. So the area is indeed infinite.

Wait, but a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite surface. So perhaps the metric in the question is not that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. Hmm, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the metric is that of a sphere, but in pseudo-Riemannian terms. But no, a pseudosphere is a 2D surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. The area of a pseudosphere in its own metric is finite. For example, the tractricoid has finite area, but I'm not sure of the exact value. 

Wait, but in the metric given, the area seems to be diverging. So perhaps the answer is D) +infty. But that would mean the area is infinite, which contradicts my earlier thought about the pseudosphere's area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the metric again. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, so sqrt(det g) = 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But when you integrate this over the entire disk (r <2), the integral becomes infinite because the integrand behaves like 1/(4- r²) near r=2. So the integral ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr. Let me compute this again:

Integrate (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me do substitution: Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln|u| + C. Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the integral is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (-16)(-infty - ln4) = (-16)(-infty) → positive infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, a pseudosphere's area is finite. So why is this metric giving an infinite area? Maybe because it's not a compact space. Wait, the pseudosphere is a compact surface, so its area should be finite.

Ah, perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2, so perhaps the metric is not that of a compact surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again: the given metric is in 2D, so it's a 2D space. The standard pseudosphere (tractricoid) is an immersed surface in 3D space, but its induced metric would be a 2D metric with finite area.

Wait, but the question gives a 2D metric, so perhaps it's representing the entire hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. So the area is infinite, so option D) is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element in this metric. The metric is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det(g) = g_{xx} \cdot g_{yy} = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( \theta \) from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Switching the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

This result aligns with the fact that the given metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. While a pseudosphere (e.g., the tractricoid) is a compact surface with finite area, the metric provided does not describe a compact pseudosphere but rather an infinite hyperbolic plane.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.
