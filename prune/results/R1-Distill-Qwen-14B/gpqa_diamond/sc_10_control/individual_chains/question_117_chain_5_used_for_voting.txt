Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomers are compounds that are mirror images of each other and can't be superimposed. These are also called enantiomers, right? They have the same physical properties except for the way they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. I need to check each one for possible stereoisomerism, specifically enantiomers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this is a biphenyl structure with substituents. The main thing here is the biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6,6' have nitro groups. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, but do they have any stereogenic centers?

Wait, the substituents on the biphenyl: are any of the carbons attached to four different groups? Let's see. The central carbons where the rings are connected (maybe the 1 and 1' positions) are attached to two phenyl rings, two methyl groups (from the dimethyl ester), and the nitro groups? Or wait, the formula says 6,6' are nitro. So each ring has a nitro at position 6, and the other substituents are at 2 and 2'.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the central carbon (the one connecting the two biphenyl rings) doesn't have four different groups. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', and the methyl ester groups are at 2 and 2', so each ring has substituents at 2,2',6,6'. So the central carbon (maybe the 1 position) is attached to two phenyl groups, a methyl ester, and another substituent? Wait, no, the 1 and 1' positions are where the rings are joined, so that's a single bond between the two carbons. So each of those carbons is attached to two benzene rings (because biphenyl), a methyl group from the ester, perhaps a nitro group? Wait, no, the nitro is at 6 and 6', which are positions on the benzene rings, not on the central carbons.

Wait, maybe each of the central carbons (1 and 1') is attached to two benzene rings, a methyl group (from the ester), and maybe a hydrogen? So each central carbon: two rings, one methyl, and one H. That would mean each central C has two identical groups (the two benzene rings). So, no, that can't be. So maybe each of these central carbons isn't a stereogenic center because they don't have four different substituents.

But wait, the structure could have some kind of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has axial chirality because of the biphenyl structure. Wait, axial chirality is a thing for biphenyls where the two rings are connected by a single bond, and the substituents on each ring can lead to different configurations.

Wait, so axial chirality occurs when there's a lack of a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored, then you might have enantiomers. For example, if on each phenyl ring, the substituents are in positions that create a non-superimposable mirror image.

So looking at the compound, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetric? Let me thinkâ€”each ring is attached at position 1 to the central bond. So for each ring, at position 1 is connected to the other ring. So the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in positions that are across from each other. Wait, position 2 on one ring is adjacent to position 1, and position 6 is across from position 1. No, wait, in a benzene ring, numbering starts at 1, then 2 is next, 3 is opposite, etc. Wait, no: benzene is six-membered. So position 1, then next is 2, then 3 (opposite to 1?), 4 (opposite to 2?), 5 (next to 6), 6 (next to 1). No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a benzene ring, if position 1 is where the biphenyl is attached, then position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 3 is two positions away, so opposite to 1 would be position 4? Or maybe position 4 is adjacent to position 3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as each ring having substituents at 2 and 6. So position 2 is next to position 1, and position 6 is on the same ring, but across from position 2? No, wait: position 2 is next to 1, then moving clockwise, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 6 would be opposite to position 2? No, that can't be right because benzene is 6-membered: position 2 is opposite to position 5, and position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. Hmm, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the first ring: connected at 1. The substituents at 2 (adjacent to 1) and 6 (also adjacent to 1, but in the other direction). So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point of attachment (position 1). So on each ring, the two substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if each substituent is on adjacent positions, then is there a plane of symmetry? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each ring's substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. So, the biphenyl could have two different configurations: one where the substituents are on the same side, and another where they are opposite. Or maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis.

If that's the case, then this compound would exhibit optical isomerism because of axial chirality. So I think compound 1 can have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3O-COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH, but as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Now, does this molecule have a stereogenic center? Let's look at the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached. The carbon with OH has two CH3 groups (from the CH(OH)CH3?), wait no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is the second carbon.

The carbon with OH is attached to what? Let's see: the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),

- One OH group,

- One COOCH3 group (the ester),

- And one CH2 group (the next carbon towards the COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is the second carbon. So the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

- And another CH2? No, wait. The second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), and two hydrogens? I think I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the second carbon is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups (from the first and third?), no. Wait, the structure is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So for propanoic acid, it's CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. As an ester, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from CH3-),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3,

- And another CH2 group? Wait, no. Because propanoate is three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the CH(OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And another CH2? No, wait. The CH(OH) is in the middle, so its substituents are:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? Wait, wait, no. Because the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? No, wait, that's three substituents. Wait, a carbon can't have only three substituents unless it's a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when esterified, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle CH(OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense because that would imply four substituents. Wait, each carbon in an alkane chain must have four bonds. So the middle carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),

- One COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),

- One OH group,

- And another CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps I'm thinking in a straight chain. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3-),

- Carbon 3 (COOCH3-),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? Because that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So yes, that's four. So the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So it's a stereogenic center. Therefore, this compound has two enantiomers: R and S configurations. So it can show optical isomerism.

So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. Its structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So the structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. Now, does this have any stereogenic centers? Let's see. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It's double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. So the structure is:

O
||
C(=O)
/   \
Ph   Ph

Wait, no. Benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So that carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, no, wait. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's spÂ² hybridized. So, the carbonyl group is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph

So the central carbon (the one in the ketone) is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So it's not a stereogenic center because it's spÂ² hybridized and trigonal planar. So no chiral centers here. Are there any other stereogenic centers in benzophenone? No, because all the other carbons are either in the aromatic rings (which are flat) or don't have four different substituents.

Wait, but wait, could benzophenone have some kind of geometric isomerism? Like, maybe the two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbonyl group? But wait, in a carbonyl group, the two phenyl groups are on the same side because of the double bond. No, wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, in a carbonyl group, the two substituents (the two phenyl groups) are on either side of the double bond. So in benzophenone, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait: the carbonyl is a double bond, so the two phenyl groups are on the same side, right? No, actually, the two substituents are on the same side because the carbonyl group is a double bond. So when you have Ph-C(=O)-Ph, the two phenyl groups are on the same side, but wait, that can't be because each is attached to the carbon, which is double-bonded to O. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the possibilities.

Wait, the carbonyl group is a planar structure. So the two phenyl groups are attached on either side of the carbonyl. So, is there a possibility of geometric isomerism here? Because the two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, because both substituents are the same (Ph), any geometric isomerism would be identical, meaning no geometric isomerism. So, for benzophenone, there's no possibility of enantiomers because there's no chiral centers, and the molecule isn't chiral in any other way. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form, so dimethyl fumarate would be the diester. The structure of fumarate is a trans-diepoxy structure, but wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would be (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

CH2CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3     O=C-OCH3
   ||
CH2CH2 

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 
    |
CH2-CH2
     ||
     O-C-OCH3
      |
      CH2

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O

Wait, no, let me think again. Fumarate is (E) configuration, meaning that the two substituents (the methyl ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

CH2CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3
   ||
O=C-OCH3
CH2CH2

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to visualize it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \   /
    C=C
   /   \
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the (E) configuration, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So as an ester, it's dimethyl (E)-butenedioate. So the structure would have two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. This is a case of geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But does this lead to optical isomerism? Wait, no. Because geometric isomerism (cis-trans) refers to different spatial arrangements around a double bond. However, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a chiral axis (like in allenes). In this case, the molecule is symmetric in a way that it doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2=C
   || 
O=C-OCH3
    \
     CH2
     /
O=C-OCH3

No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3
||

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||
 
But wait, this is getting me confused. Let me think in terms of the molecule's structure. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, actually, the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a double bond. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O=C-OCH3
CH2-CH2

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me visualize it correctly. Fumarate is:

O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3

So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it the E (trans) configuration.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If you draw a plane through the double bond, would it make the two halves mirror images? The structure is symmetric because each substituent is the same (both are O=C-OCH3 groups) and they are on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, it is not chiral. So, it cannot have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, let me think again. If the substituents are the same on each side, the molecule is achiral, right? So there's no enantiomers here. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical, so it's achiral. Therefore, it can't show optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes diastereomers can have different physical properties. But optical isomerism refers to enantiomers. So if the molecule is achiral, it can't have enantiomers.

Wait, another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any stereogenic centers? No, because the central carbons are double-bonded and thus not chiral centers. So no, it doesn't have any stereogenic centers. Therefore, it can't have enantiomers. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when a molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides, if the groups are the same on each side, it can't be chiral. So in this case, groups on each side are identical (both O=C-OCH3), so no chirality.

Hmm, so to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Can it have axial chirality? If the substituents on each biphenyl ring are arranged asymmetrically, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry, then yes, it would have optical isomerism. So I think compound 1 can show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, has a stereogenic center, so optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, no axial chirality, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No, it's symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

So, which compounds show optical isomerism? Compounds 1 and 2, and 4? Wait, no, wait. I thought 4 doesn't. So in the four compounds, 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

Wait, let me go back to compound 4. Wait, the initial question is about the compounds that show optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about compound 1. Let me recheck. The structure is a biphenyl with substituents in specific positions. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it would have axial chirality. So in biphenyls, when the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a non-symmetrical arrangement, the molecule can be chiral.

Wait, each ring has a methyl ester group at 2 and a nitro group at 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, that could create a chiral center or axial chirality.

Wait, but if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So for biphenyls with substituents at symmetrical positions, the molecule could be achiral. But if the substituents are in positions that make the arrangement unsymmetrical, it would be chiral.

In this case, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, along with the nitro groups, might create an asymmetrical arrangement. So the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and thus capable of optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 can show optical isomerism.

So, the list is:

1: Yes

2: Yes

3: No

4: No

So, looking at the options, which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4 â†’ but 4 is No.

Option B)3 and4 â†’ No.

Option C)2 and3 â†’ No.

Option D)1 and2 â†’ Yes.

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism. So the answer would be 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 doesn't. So option A includes 4, but if 4 doesn't, then A is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be options 1 and 2 showing optical isomerism, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of stereogenic centers or axial chirality, which are necessary for enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) to exist.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. The key factor here is axial chirality, which occurs when the substituents on the biphenyl rings lack a plane of symmetry. The arrangement of the methyl ester groups at 2 and 2' and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' creates an asymmetrical structure, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒCH(OH)COOCHâ‚ƒ. The carbon atom at the hydroxyl group (C2) is attached to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, OH, COOCHâ‚ƒ, and H. This makes it a stereogenic center, allowing for enantiomers (R and S configurations). Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the central carbon is part of a planar carbonyl group. This carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents and lacks any chiral centers or axial chirality, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CHâ‚ƒOOC-CH=CH-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 do not. The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomers are compounds that are mirror images of each other and can't be superimposed. These are also called enantiomers, right? They have the same physical properties except for the way they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. I need to check each one for possible stereoisomerism, specifically enantiomers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this is a biphenyl structure with substituents. The main thing here is the biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6,6' have nitro groups. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, but do they have any stereogenic centers?

Wait, the substituents on the biphenyl: are any of the carbons attached to four different groups? Let's see. The central carbons where the rings are connected (maybe the 1 and 1' positions) are attached to two phenyl rings, two methyl groups (from the dimethyl ester), and the nitro groups? Or wait, the formula says 6,6' are nitro. So each ring has a nitro at position 6, and the other substituents are at 2 and 2'.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the central carbon (the one connecting the two biphenyl rings) doesn't have four different groups. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', and the methyl ester groups are at 2 and 2', so each ring has substituents at 2,2',6,6'. So the central carbon (maybe the 1 position) is attached to two phenyl groups, a methyl ester, and another substituent? Wait, no, the 1 and 1' positions are where the rings are joined, so that's a single bond between the two carbons. So each of those carbons is attached to two benzene rings (because biphenyl), a methyl group from the ester, perhaps a nitro group? Wait, no, the nitro is at 6 and 6', which are positions on the benzene rings, not on the central carbons.

Wait, maybe each of the central carbons (1 and 1') is attached to two benzene rings, a methyl group (from the ester), and maybe a hydrogen? So each central carbon: two rings, one methyl, and one H. That would mean each central C has two identical groups (the two benzene rings). So, no, that can't be. So maybe each of these central carbons isn't a stereogenic center because they don't have four different substituents.

But wait, the structure could have some kind of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has axial chirality because of the biphenyl structure. Wait, axial chirality is a thing for biphenyls where the two rings are connected by a single bond, and the substituents on each ring can lead to different configurations.

Wait, so axial chirality occurs when there's a lack of a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored, then you might have enantiomers. For example, if on each phenyl ring, the substituents are in positions that create a non-superimposable mirror image.

So looking at the compound, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetric? Let me thinkâ€”each ring is attached at position 1 to the central bond. So for each ring, at position 1 is connected to the other ring. So the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in positions that are across from each other. Wait, position 2 on one ring is adjacent to position 1, and position 6 is across from position 1. No, wait, in a benzene ring, numbering starts at 1, then 2 is next, 3 is opposite, etc. Wait, no: benzene is six-membered. So position 1, then next is 2, then 3 (opposite to 1?), 4 (opposite to 2?), 5 (next to 6), 6 (next to 1). No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a benzene ring, if position 1 is where the biphenyl is attached, then position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 3 is two positions away, so opposite to 1 would be position 4? Or maybe position 4 is adjacent to position 3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as each ring having substituents at 2 and 6. So position 2 is next to position 1, and position 6 is on the same ring, but across from position 2? No, wait: position 2 is next to 1, then moving clockwise, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 6 would be opposite to position 2? No, that can't be right because benzene is 6-membered: position 2 is opposite to position 5, and position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. Hmm, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the first ring: connected at 1. The substituents at 2 (adjacent to 1) and 6 (also adjacent to 1, but in the other direction). So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point of attachment (position 1). So on each ring, the two substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if each substituent is on adjacent positions, then is there a plane of symmetry? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each ring's substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. So, the biphenyl could have two different configurations: one where the substituents are on the same side, and another where they are opposite. Or maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis.

If that's the case, then this compound would exhibit optical isomerism because of axial chirality. So I think compound 1 can have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3O-COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH, but as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Now, does this molecule have a stereogenic center? Let's look at the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached. The carbon with OH has two CH3 groups (from the CH(OH)CH3?), wait no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is the second carbon.

The carbon with OH is attached to what? Let's see: the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),

- One OH group,

- One COOCH3 group (the ester),

- And one CH2 group (the next carbon towards the COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is the second carbon. So the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

- And another CH2? No, wait. The second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), and two hydrogens? I think I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the second carbon is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups (from the first and third?), no. Wait, the structure is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So for propanoic acid, it's CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. As an ester, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from CH3-),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3,

- And another CH2 group? Wait, no. Because propanoate is three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the CH(OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And another CH2? No, wait. The CH(OH) is in the middle, so its substituents are:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? Wait, wait, no. Because the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? No, wait, that's three substituents. Wait, a carbon can't have only three substituents unless it's a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when esterified, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle CH(OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- OH,

- And another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense because that would imply four substituents. Wait, each carbon in an alkane chain must have four bonds. So the middle carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),

- One COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),

- One OH group,

- And another CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps I'm thinking in a straight chain. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3-),

- Carbon 3 (COOCH3-),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? Because that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So yes, that's four. So the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So it's a stereogenic center. Therefore, this compound has two enantiomers: R and S configurations. So it can show optical isomerism.

So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. Its structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So the structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. Now, does this have any stereogenic centers? Let's see. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It's double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. So the structure is:

O
||
C(=O)
/   \
Ph   Ph

Wait, no. Benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So that carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, no, wait. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's spÂ² hybridized. So, the carbonyl group is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph

So the central carbon (the one in the ketone) is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So it's not a stereogenic center because it's spÂ² hybridized and trigonal planar. So no chiral centers here. Are there any other stereogenic centers in benzophenone? No, because all the other carbons are either in the aromatic rings (which are flat) or don't have four different substituents.

Wait, but wait, could benzophenone have some kind of geometric isomerism? Like, maybe the two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbonyl group? But wait, in a carbonyl group, the two phenyl groups are on the same side because of the double bond. No, wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, in a carbonyl group, the two substituents (the two phenyl groups) are on either side of the double bond. So in benzophenone, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait: the carbonyl is a double bond, so the two phenyl groups are on the same side, right? No, actually, the two substituents are on the same side because the carbonyl group is a double bond. So when you have Ph-C(=O)-Ph, the two phenyl groups are on the same side, but wait, that can't be because each is attached to the carbon, which is double-bonded to O. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the possibilities.

Wait, the carbonyl group is a planar structure. So the two phenyl groups are attached on either side of the carbonyl. So, is there a possibility of geometric isomerism here? Because the two phenyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, because both substituents are the same (Ph), any geometric isomerism would be identical, meaning no geometric isomerism. So, for benzophenone, there's no possibility of enantiomers because there's no chiral centers, and the molecule isn't chiral in any other way. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form, so dimethyl fumarate would be the diester. The structure of fumarate is a trans-diepoxy structure, but wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would be (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

CH2CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3     O=C-OCH3
   ||
CH2CH2 

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 
    |
CH2-CH2
     ||
     O-C-OCH3
      |
      CH2

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O

Wait, no, let me think again. Fumarate is (E) configuration, meaning that the two substituents (the methyl ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

CH2CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3
   ||
O=C-OCH3
CH2CH2

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to visualize it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \   /
    C=C
   /   \
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the (E) configuration, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So as an ester, it's dimethyl (E)-butenedioate. So the structure would have two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. This is a case of geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But does this lead to optical isomerism? Wait, no. Because geometric isomerism (cis-trans) refers to different spatial arrangements around a double bond. However, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a chiral axis (like in allenes). In this case, the molecule is symmetric in a way that it doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2=C
   || 
O=C-OCH3
    \
     CH2
     /
O=C-OCH3

No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3
||

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||
 
But wait, this is getting me confused. Let me think in terms of the molecule's structure. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, actually, the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a double bond. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2
   || 
O=C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O=C-OCH3
CH2-CH2

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me visualize it correctly. Fumarate is:

O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3

So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it the E (trans) configuration.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If you draw a plane through the double bond, would it make the two halves mirror images? The structure is symmetric because each substituent is the same (both are O=C-OCH3 groups) and they are on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, it is not chiral. So, it cannot have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, let me think again. If the substituents are the same on each side, the molecule is achiral, right? So there's no enantiomers here. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical, so it's achiral. Therefore, it can't show optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes diastereomers can have different physical properties. But optical isomerism refers to enantiomers. So if the molecule is achiral, it can't have enantiomers.

Wait, another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any stereogenic centers? No, because the central carbons are double-bonded and thus not chiral centers. So no, it doesn't have any stereogenic centers. Therefore, it can't have enantiomers. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when a molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides, if the groups are the same on each side, it can't be chiral. So in this case, groups on each side are identical (both O=C-OCH3), so no chirality.

Hmm, so to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Can it have axial chirality? If the substituents on each biphenyl ring are arranged asymmetrically, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry, then yes, it would have optical isomerism. So I think compound 1 can show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, has a stereogenic center, so optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, no axial chirality, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No, it's symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

So, which compounds show optical isomerism? Compounds 1 and 2, and 4? Wait, no, wait. I thought 4 doesn't. So in the four compounds, 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

Wait, let me go back to compound 4. Wait, the initial question is about the compounds that show optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about compound 1. Let me recheck. The structure is a biphenyl with substituents in specific positions. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it would have axial chirality. So in biphenyls, when the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a non-symmetrical arrangement, the molecule can be chiral.

Wait, each ring has a methyl ester group at 2 and a nitro group at 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, that could create a chiral center or axial chirality.

Wait, but if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So for biphenyls with substituents at symmetrical positions, the molecule could be achiral. But if the substituents are in positions that make the arrangement unsymmetrical, it would be chiral.

In this case, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, along with the nitro groups, might create an asymmetrical arrangement. So the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and thus capable of optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 can show optical isomerism.

So, the list is:

1: Yes

2: Yes

3: No

4: No

So, looking at the options, which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4 â†’ but 4 is No.

Option B)3 and4 â†’ No.

Option C)2 and3 â†’ No.

Option D)1 and2 â†’ Yes.

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism. So the answer would be 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 doesn't. So option A includes 4, but if 4 doesn't, then A is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be options 1 and 2 showing optical isomerism, which is option D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of stereogenic centers or axial chirality, which are necessary for enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) to exist.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. The key factor here is axial chirality, which occurs when the substituents on the biphenyl rings lack a plane of symmetry. The arrangement of the methyl ester groups at 2 and 2' and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' creates an asymmetrical structure, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒCH(OH)COOCHâ‚ƒ. The carbon atom at the hydroxyl group (C2) is attached to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, OH, COOCHâ‚ƒ, and H. This makes it a stereogenic center, allowing for enantiomers (R and S configurations). Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the central carbon is part of a planar carbonyl group. This carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents and lacks any chiral centers or axial chirality, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CHâ‚ƒOOC-CH=CH-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 do not. The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
