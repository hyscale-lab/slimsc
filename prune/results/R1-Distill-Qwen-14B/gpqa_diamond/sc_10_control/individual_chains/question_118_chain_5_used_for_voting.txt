Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, wait, what's that structure again?

So, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let me visualize cyclopentene. Cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with one double bond. The 'enol' part suggests that there's an adjacent double bond with an alcohol group. Wait, enol is a compound where an alcohol is attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So cyclopent-1-enol would be where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl (-OH) group is on C2. But wait, in the molecule we're given, it's 4,4-dimethyl. So the positions are numbered such that the two methyl groups are on C4.

Wait, let me draw the structure. The cyclopentene ring is a five-membered ring. Let's number the ring in a way that the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, cyclopent-1-enol would have the OH group on C2. But wait, the enol form is when the H is on C2 and the OH is on C1? Or wait, no. Wait, the enol form of a ketone has the OH on the same carbon as a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with keto-enol tautomerism here.

Wait, no, the compound given is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So it's cyclopentene (five-membered ring, double bond between C1 and C2) with an enol structure. So, the enol would have an OH group on C2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure would be:

- C1 is double bonded to C2.
- C2 has an -OH group.
- Two methyl groups are attached to C4.

So, the structure is cyclopentene where the double bond is C1-C2, and the hydroxyl is on C2. Plus, the C4 has two methyl groups, so it's 4,4-dimethyl.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine (Br2) is a dienophile, or in other contexts, it's a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. But wait, in this case, the compound is an enol, which is a diene? Or is it a dienophile?

Wait, enols can act as dienes in Diels-Alder reactions. The diene is conjugated, right? So, if we have an enol, which is a conjugated diene (the double bond and the adjacent single bond with the OH), but wait, in cyclopentene, the double bond is conjugated with the ring. Wait, maybe the cyclopent-1-enol has a conjugated diene system? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another possibility is that bromine is adding across a double bond. Bromine addition is a common reaction. When bromine adds to a double bond, it typically does so in a dibromide addition, possibly with anti addition.

So, in this case, the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would lead to dibromide addition across that double bond.

Wait, but wait, the compound is an enol. Enols can undergo different reactions based on their structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination via a different pathway, like electrophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So structure-wise, it's a cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

So when bromine (Br2) is added, it's likely to react via addition across the double bond. So, the double bond at C1-C2 will react with Br2.

In the addition of bromine to a double bond, the mechanism is typically via the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate. The Br2 adds across the double bond, and the ring opens to form the dibromide. The addition is anti because the bromide ions attack from opposite sides, leading to the trans addition.

But wait, in a cyclic system like cyclopentene, the addition might lead to some ring strain. Let me think about the products.

The starting molecule is a cyclopentene enol. After Br2 addition, the double bond would be replaced by two Br atoms. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, but where would the Brs add?

Wait, the cyclopentene ring has five members, so the addition of Br2 would result in a cyclopentane ring with two Br substituents on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2), and the OH group on C2 as well? Or wait, no, the OH is on C2, and the Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, the starting molecule has the OH on C2, adjacent to the double bond. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would add to C1 and C2, which already have substituents. So, the C2 has an OH and a Br now?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The original structure is:

- C1: double bonded to C2.
- C2: -OH and attached to C1 and C3.
- C4: two methyl groups.

So, when Br2 adds across the double bond, the Br atoms will add to C1 and C2. So, C1 would have one Br, C2 would have another Br. But C2 already has the OH group. So, I think the product would have Br on C1 and C2, along with the existing OH on C2. But wait, that can't be right because the OH is on C2, which is already getting a Br. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C2.

Wait, but that would lead to the structure of 1-bromo-2-(bromo)cyclopentanol. Wait, but looking at the options, they have 1,2-dibromo and 4,4-dimethyl.

But let me look at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So, the options are either di-bromo or mono-bromo. So, if Br2 adds across the double bond, it would result in a di-bromide. So, the product would be a cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2.

Wait, but in the options, the diastereomers are given. So, the addition of Br would be either cis or trans. Since in bromonium ring opening, the Br adds with anti stereochemistry.

Wait, the starting enol is a cyclic structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would give a vicinal di-bromide, so Br on C1 and C2.

So, the initial structure is an enol, which is a conjugated system. But in this case, perhaps the reaction is an addition of Br2 across the double bond.

Wait, but wait another thing. Enols can also undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but in this case, the compound is given as an enol. So, perhaps the reaction isn't about the enol structure but just the double bond.

Wait, but if the compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, perhaps the enol form is more about the structure, and the double bond is where the reaction occurs.

So, when Br2 adds, the cyclopentene becomes cyclopentane with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, and the OH remains.

Wait, but then the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options, options A and D match this.

So, the difference between A and D is the configuration of the Br and OH groups.

Wait, in the addition of Br2, the Br atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite sides of the ring, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the addition could lead to a certain diastereomer. Let's think about the ring structure.

In the starting enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2, which is adjacent to the double bond.

When Br2 adds, the Br will add to C1 and C2, with anti addition.

So, the Br on C1 and C2 will be on opposite sides of the ring. Wait, but in the ring, the positions are such that C1 is next to C2, and the ring is five-membered.

So, when Br adds to C1 and C2, the stereochemistry would depend on how the bromonium ion forms and how the Br- opens the ring.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the stereochemistry here. Let's think of a simple cyclohexene adding Br2. The addition would be trans, leading to a vicinal di-bromide with anti configuration.

In a cyclopentene, the same would happen. So, if the starting molecule is such that the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, then adding Br2 would put Br on C1 and C2 in a trans fashion.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the diastereomerism might be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer where the Brs are on opposite sides.

Wait, but looking at the options, the diastereomers are given as (1R,2S) and (1R,2R).

Wait, let me try to figure out the configuration.

The original cyclopentene has the OH on C2, and the methyl groups on C4. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Br2 adds, the Br atoms add across the double bond with anti stereochemistry. So, the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in the cyclopentane ring, the substituents (Br and OH) would be on adjacent carbons. So, the Br on C1 would be on one face, and Br on C2 would be on the opposite face.

Wait, but the OH is on C2. So, the Br on C2 would be on the same carbon as the OH. Is that possible? Or would the addition of Br2 convert the enol into a diol with Brs?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the starting material is an enol, which is a conjugated diene? Or is it a simple alkene with an adjacent OH group.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol: the structure is a cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH on C2.

Now, when Br2 adds to the double bond, which is between C1 and C2, the addition would form a vicinal di-bromide, with Br on C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But in that structure, C2 now has both the OH and a Br atom. How does that work?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure again.

In the enol form, the structure is:

Positions:

C1 — double bond — C2 — (single bond) — C3

C2 has an OH group.

So, the Br2 would add across C1 and C2, so the Brs would be on C1 and C2.

So, in the product, C1 has Br, C2 has Br and OH.

But wait, that would mean that the product is 2-bromo-1-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, that can't be right because numbering would place the substituents in the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So, Br is before OH. So, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Br and Br, OH on C2? Wait, no, because in the product, the OH is still on C2, and Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, but if C2 has both Br and OH, that would be a geminal di-substitution, which is possible.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, options A and D are both this compound but with different stereochemistry.

So, the next question is about the configuration of the Brs.

In the addition of bromine, the Brs add in an anti fashion. So, the Br on C1 and Br on C2 would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the substituents' positions are a bit constrained.

Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring. When the double bond is between C1 and C2, adding Br2 in anti addition would mean that the Br on C1 is on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

So, if the starting material's C1 and C2 are in a certain configuration, the Brs would add trans to each other.

Wait, but the starting material's enol form has the OH on C2. So, the spatial arrangement of the substituents before and after addition is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a trans diastereomer.

But I'm not entirely sure about the stereochemistry here. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a racemic mixture, but I don't think the options suggest that.

So, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R).

Wait, so when Br adds, the configuration depends on how the Br atoms are placed.

Let me try to draw the structure.

Original double bond: C1 and C2 are double bonded. In the enol form, the OH is on C2.

When Br2 adds, the Brs add across the double bond in a trans manner. So, if the double bond is in a certain conformation, the Brs would end up on opposite sides.

But in a cyclopentene, the ring is flat, and the addition would create a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the cyclopentane ring's substituents (Br on C1 and Br on C2) would end up in a cis or trans arrangement.

Wait, considering the chair-like transition state, but cyclopentane isn't a chair, but perhaps it's a boat?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the bromonium ion formation. When the double bond attacks Br2, it forms a bromonium ion, which is a three-membered ring. Then, Br- attacks from the opposite side, leading to trans addition.

In a cyclopentene ring, this would mean that the Brs are added on opposite faces.

But in the product, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be anti. So, if the OH is on C2 in a certain configuration, the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the product would have the Br on C1 as R configuration and Br on C2 as S, or both as R or S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which are enantiomers, but looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R).

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is a simple addition of Br2 to the double bond, the major product would be the trans di-bromide. So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite sides.

In the case of cyclopentane, which is a five-membered ring, the substituents on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) would be trans.

Wait, but in a ring, trans can have specific meanings. For example, if both substituents are axial or equatorial.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration isn't the main issue here, and the main point is the presence of two Brs on C1 and C2.

Looking again at the options, options A and D are the di-bromo ones.

But what about the other options? Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, cyclopentanone with a Br on C2.

Wait, how would that form? If the enol reacts with bromine in a way that the Br adds to the C2, perhaps via electrophilic attack.

Wait, enols can undergo electrophilic attack, but under what conditions? For example, in the presence of acid, the enol is protonated, making it more reactive towards electrophiles.

But wait, the question states that the reaction is with bromine. Bromine is a dienophile, but in other contexts, it can act as an electrophile, especially under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, wait, cyclopentanone has a carbonyl group, but the starting material is an enol, which is the enol form of the ketone.

If the starting material is an enol and reacts with bromine, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, making the alpha position more susceptible to electrophilic attack.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is an enol. Enols can undergo different types of reactions, including addition reactions. But the presence of Br2 suggests it's adding to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a conjugated diene, but no, it's not. It's an enol with a single double bond.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the enol form is less stable, and under the reaction conditions, it tautomerizes to the ketone form. Then, the reaction would be bromination of the ketone.

But wait, the enol is more reactive towards certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the enol isn't stable and quickly tautomerizes to cyclopentanone.

Wait, wait, wait. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, it's the enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Enols can form from ketones via keto-enol tautomerism.

But if the enol is treated with Br2, what would happen?

Another possibility: the enol could undergo an electrophilic addition at the alpha position. Because enols are nucleophilic at the alpha position.

Wait, but bromine is a diatomic molecule. Maybe it can act as an electrophilic bromine source. So, perhaps the alpha position (adjacent to the carbonyl) would undergo bromination.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, which has the OH on C2 and the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

Wait, in the enol form, the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

If bromine adds to the alpha position, it would add to C1 or C3.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could react with Br2 in a conjugate addition, but that's more typical in Diels-Alder reactions, where a diene reacts with a dienophile.

Wait, but in this case, the enol's double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So, the structure is such that C1 is next to the double bond and the ring, and C2 has the OH and is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the Br adds across the double bond, giving a vicinal di-bromide, as I thought before. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Which matches options A and D.

Then, the question is about the configuration of the Brs. If the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite sides.

But in a cyclopentane ring, when two substituents on adjacent carbons are on opposite sides, they are considered trans.

So, the diastereomer formed would have the Br on C1 as R and on C2 as S, or the other way around, depending on the starting structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration would result in both Brs being R.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but looking at the options, A and D are possible.

Wait, another thought: when adding Br2 to a cyclic diene, the most stable product is the one with the trans addition. But in a five-membered ring, the trans addition may be less strained than in a six-membered ring.

Anyway, perhaps the correct product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is either option A or D.

Looking again at the options, A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Hmm, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, leading to a cis arrangement, which would be (1R,2R) or (1S,2S).

But wait, the addition of Br2 is anti, which would lead to the Brs being on opposite faces. So in a ring, this would produce a trans arrangement.

Wait, in a cyclopentane ring, if the Brs are on adjacent carbons and opposite faces, the configuration might be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). So, option A is (1R,2S).

Alternatively, maybe the starting enol has a certain configuration that would influence the outcome.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the enol as having the OH on a certain face.

Let me try to imagine the structure:

- C1 is connected to C2 via a double bond.
- C2 has an OH group on, say, the upper face.
- The ring is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl groups are on C4.

When Br2 adds, the Brs would add across the double bond in a trans manner. So, the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

If the OH is on the upper face of C2, then the Br on C2 would be on the lower face, and the Br on C1 would be on the upper face.

Wait, but that would mean that the Brs are on opposite faces. So, the configuration would be such that C1 is R and C2 is S, for example.

So, option A is (1R,2S), which would fit this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is (1S,2R), but since the options don't have that, and A is (1R,2S), that's the likely option.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, making the configuration (1R,2R), as in option D.

I'm a bit stuck here. Another approach: when adding Br2 to a cyclohexene, the addition is trans, leading to a vicinal di-bromide with Brs on opposite faces, resulting in a trans diastereomer. Similarly, in cyclopentene, the addition would be anti, leading to a trans arrangement.

In the case of the product, the substituents on C1 and C2 (the Brs) would be on opposite faces.

So, in the cyclopentanol product, the Br on C1 and Br on C2 would be on opposite faces, leading to a certain diastereomer.

Now, considering the configuration, if the Br on C1 is on the same face as the OH on C2, that would create a certain stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, (1R,2S).

But wait, another thought: when you add Br2 to a double bond, the Brs add in a trans fashion. So, if the starting material is a ring, the Brs would add in a way that their positions are across from each other.

But in the case where the starting material has the OH on C2, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face to the Br on C1.

So, in the case where the OH is on C2, and the Br on C2 is trans to the Br on C1, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

So, the product would be a diastereomer with Brs on opposite faces, which would match option A or D.

Wait, but the options don't have (1S,2R), so perhaps option A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the major outcome is the di-bromide, with the configuration as option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Another approach: the reaction of enols with bromine. Maybe the reaction isn't addition but substitution.

Wait, but enols are more likely to undergo addition reactions across the double bond, especially with Br2 which is a good dienophile. So, the major product would be the di-bromide.

So, among the options, A and D are the di-bromo products. So, the correct answer is either A or D.

But how to decide between the two?

Well, the addition of Br2 to a double bond would give a vicinal di-bromide with anti stereochemistry.

In the starting enol, the configuration is such that when the Brs add, they end up on opposite sides.

Assuming that the starting enol has a certain configuration, perhaps the product would have both Brs on the same side, making the configuration (1R,2R), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, (1R,2S).

Wait, I'm still not completely confident. Let me think of the possibility of the product. If the product is a di-bromide, then the correct option is either A or D.

But looking again at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Wait, another thought: in the addition of Br2, the bromide ion attacks the less substituted carbon in the bromonium ion. Wait, in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, both of which are part of the ring.

So, the bromide could attack either C1 or C2, but considering the ring's structure, perhaps the attack leads to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs adding in a way that the substituents (Br on C1 and C2) are trans.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe it's better to think about the possible products again.

Another angle: the reaction of an enol with a dienophile like Br2 could lead to a diels-alder type reaction, but I'm not sure if the enol has the necessary diene structure for that. Alternatively, perhaps the enol doesn't act as a diene, and the reaction is a simple dihydroxylation, but that's with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is bromination of the enol via an electrophilic attack. Enols are nucleophilic at the alpha position, so perhaps the Br adds to the alpha carbon.

But the alpha carbon in the enol is C1 and C3. So, perhaps the Br adds to C1 or C3.

Wait, but adding Br to C1 would be possible, leading to a mono-brominated product.

But looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, that's a bromine on C2.

Wait, but that's the same carbon as the OH in the enol. How would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the enol tautomerizes to the ketone (cyclopentanone), and then undergoes bromination at the alpha position.

But the question is about the reaction between the enol and bromine, not the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an enol, which can undergo bromination at the alpha position. So, the enol's alpha carbon would be C1 and C3. So, bromine could add to C1 or C3, leading to a mono-bromide.

But in the options, the mono-bromides are options B and C. Let me look at them.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the bromine is on C2 of the cyclopentanone.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the Br is on C4.

Wait, but the starting material is the enol, which is more reactive towards electrophilic attack at the alpha position.

So, if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then undergoes bromination at C1 or C3, perhaps leading to a product where Br is on C2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Bromine in what solvent? But the question doesn't specify, so I have to assume it's a typical bromine addition.

So, the most likely reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, resulting in a vicinal di-bromide.

Therefore, the product should be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A or D.

Now, the question is the configuration.

Assuming that the addition is anti, meaning that the Brs are on opposite faces.

In a cyclopentane ring, C1 and C2 are adjacent. If the Br on C1 is R and the Br on C2 is S, that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration leads to both Brs being R, as in option D.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement of the starting material, it's hard to decide.

But considering that the enol has a certain configuration, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on opposite sides, resulting in (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

Given the options, the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the ring's structure. Adding Brs in anti fashion would place them on opposite sides. So, if the starting material is such that the OH is on the upper face of C2, then the Br on C1 would be on the upper face, and the Br on C2 would be on the lower face.

Wait, but that would lead to the Br on C1 and C2 being on opposite faces, which would correspond to (1R,2S) if the configurations are R and S, respectively.

But how do I determine R and S?

Alternatively, perhaps the product has both Brs on the same side, leading to (1R,2R) configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Imagine cyclopentane ring. Let's assign positions:

C1 is at the top, connected to C2 and C5.

C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has an OH and Br.

C3 is connected to C2 and C4.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5, with two methyl groups.

C5 is connected to C4 and C1.

The double bond is between C1 and C2 in the starting material.

Adding Br2 across the double bond would place Br on C1 and C2.

Assuming the addition is anti, the Br on C1 is on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

So, if the Br on C1 is on the front face, the Br on C2 is on the back face.

But the OH is on C2. So, the OH's position would influence the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the OH is on the same face as the Br on C1, leading to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on opposite faces, making a trans vicinal di-bromide.

In this case, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), but since the options don't have both, option A is (1R,2S), which is the likely answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, (1R,2R), if the Brs add in a way that they're on the same face.

Wait, but the addition of Br2 is stereospecific, leading to trans addition.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and I'll have to make a decision.

So, the major outcome is the addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to a di-bromo cyclopentanol with a specific stereochemistry. Among the options, the product would be either A or D.

But I'm more confident now that the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is a five-membered cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4. Bromine (Br₂) reacts with the double bond, leading to the addition of Br atoms across the double bond. This addition occurs in an anti fashion, forming a vicinal dibromide.

The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, where Br atoms are added to C1 and C2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti addition of Br₂, resulting in the Br atoms being on opposite sides of the ring. This leads to the (1R,2S) configuration as the major product, as the anti addition places the Br atoms trans to each other.

Among the given options:
- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol matches the expected product with the correct stereochemistry.
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol does not match the stereochemistry expected from anti addition.
- **Options B and C**: These involve mono-brominated products, which are not consistent with the reaction mechanism of Br₂ addition across the double bond.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, wait, what's that structure again?

So, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let me visualize cyclopentene. Cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with one double bond. The 'enol' part suggests that there's an adjacent double bond with an alcohol group. Wait, enol is a compound where an alcohol is attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So cyclopent-1-enol would be where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl (-OH) group is on C2. But wait, in the molecule we're given, it's 4,4-dimethyl. So the positions are numbered such that the two methyl groups are on C4.

Wait, let me draw the structure. The cyclopentene ring is a five-membered ring. Let's number the ring in a way that the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, cyclopent-1-enol would have the OH group on C2. But wait, the enol form is when the H is on C2 and the OH is on C1? Or wait, no. Wait, the enol form of a ketone has the OH on the same carbon as a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with keto-enol tautomerism here.

Wait, no, the compound given is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So it's cyclopentene (five-membered ring, double bond between C1 and C2) with an enol structure. So, the enol would have an OH group on C2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure would be:

- C1 is double bonded to C2.
- C2 has an -OH group.
- Two methyl groups are attached to C4.

So, the structure is cyclopentene where the double bond is C1-C2, and the hydroxyl is on C2. Plus, the C4 has two methyl groups, so it's 4,4-dimethyl.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine (Br2) is a dienophile, or in other contexts, it's a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. But wait, in this case, the compound is an enol, which is a diene? Or is it a dienophile?

Wait, enols can act as dienes in Diels-Alder reactions. The diene is conjugated, right? So, if we have an enol, which is a conjugated diene (the double bond and the adjacent single bond with the OH), but wait, in cyclopentene, the double bond is conjugated with the ring. Wait, maybe the cyclopent-1-enol has a conjugated diene system? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another possibility is that bromine is adding across a double bond. Bromine addition is a common reaction. When bromine adds to a double bond, it typically does so in a dibromide addition, possibly with anti addition.

So, in this case, the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would lead to dibromide addition across that double bond.

Wait, but wait, the compound is an enol. Enols can undergo different reactions based on their structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination via a different pathway, like electrophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So structure-wise, it's a cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

So when bromine (Br2) is added, it's likely to react via addition across the double bond. So, the double bond at C1-C2 will react with Br2.

In the addition of bromine to a double bond, the mechanism is typically via the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate. The Br2 adds across the double bond, and the ring opens to form the dibromide. The addition is anti because the bromide ions attack from opposite sides, leading to the trans addition.

But wait, in a cyclic system like cyclopentene, the addition might lead to some ring strain. Let me think about the products.

The starting molecule is a cyclopentene enol. After Br2 addition, the double bond would be replaced by two Br atoms. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, but where would the Brs add?

Wait, the cyclopentene ring has five members, so the addition of Br2 would result in a cyclopentane ring with two Br substituents on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2), and the OH group on C2 as well? Or wait, no, the OH is on C2, and the Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, the starting molecule has the OH on C2, adjacent to the double bond. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would add to C1 and C2, which already have substituents. So, the C2 has an OH and a Br now?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The original structure is:

- C1: double bonded to C2.
- C2: -OH and attached to C1 and C3.
- C4: two methyl groups.

So, when Br2 adds across the double bond, the Br atoms will add to C1 and C2. So, C1 would have one Br, C2 would have another Br. But C2 already has the OH group. So, I think the product would have Br on C1 and C2, along with the existing OH on C2. But wait, that can't be right because the OH is on C2, which is already getting a Br. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C2.

Wait, but that would lead to the structure of 1-bromo-2-(bromo)cyclopentanol. Wait, but looking at the options, they have 1,2-dibromo and 4,4-dimethyl.

But let me look at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So, the options are either di-bromo or mono-bromo. So, if Br2 adds across the double bond, it would result in a di-bromide. So, the product would be a cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2.

Wait, but in the options, the diastereomers are given. So, the addition of Br would be either cis or trans. Since in bromonium ring opening, the Br adds with anti stereochemistry.

Wait, the starting enol is a cyclic structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would give a vicinal di-bromide, so Br on C1 and C2.

So, the initial structure is an enol, which is a conjugated system. But in this case, perhaps the reaction is an addition of Br2 across the double bond.

Wait, but wait another thing. Enols can also undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but in this case, the compound is given as an enol. So, perhaps the reaction isn't about the enol structure but just the double bond.

Wait, but if the compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, perhaps the enol form is more about the structure, and the double bond is where the reaction occurs.

So, when Br2 adds, the cyclopentene becomes cyclopentane with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, and the OH remains.

Wait, but then the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options, options A and D match this.

So, the difference between A and D is the configuration of the Br and OH groups.

Wait, in the addition of Br2, the Br atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite sides of the ring, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the addition could lead to a certain diastereomer. Let's think about the ring structure.

In the starting enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2, which is adjacent to the double bond.

When Br2 adds, the Br will add to C1 and C2, with anti addition.

So, the Br on C1 and C2 will be on opposite sides of the ring. Wait, but in the ring, the positions are such that C1 is next to C2, and the ring is five-membered.

So, when Br adds to C1 and C2, the stereochemistry would depend on how the bromonium ion forms and how the Br- opens the ring.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the stereochemistry here. Let's think of a simple cyclohexene adding Br2. The addition would be trans, leading to a vicinal di-bromide with anti configuration.

In a cyclopentene, the same would happen. So, if the starting molecule is such that the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, then adding Br2 would put Br on C1 and C2 in a trans fashion.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the diastereomerism might be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer where the Brs are on opposite sides.

Wait, but looking at the options, the diastereomers are given as (1R,2S) and (1R,2R).

Wait, let me try to figure out the configuration.

The original cyclopentene has the OH on C2, and the methyl groups on C4. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Br2 adds, the Br atoms add across the double bond with anti stereochemistry. So, the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in the cyclopentane ring, the substituents (Br and OH) would be on adjacent carbons. So, the Br on C1 would be on one face, and Br on C2 would be on the opposite face.

Wait, but the OH is on C2. So, the Br on C2 would be on the same carbon as the OH. Is that possible? Or would the addition of Br2 convert the enol into a diol with Brs?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the starting material is an enol, which is a conjugated diene? Or is it a simple alkene with an adjacent OH group.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol: the structure is a cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH on C2.

Now, when Br2 adds to the double bond, which is between C1 and C2, the addition would form a vicinal di-bromide, with Br on C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But in that structure, C2 now has both the OH and a Br atom. How does that work?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure again.

In the enol form, the structure is:

Positions:

C1 — double bond — C2 — (single bond) — C3

C2 has an OH group.

So, the Br2 would add across C1 and C2, so the Brs would be on C1 and C2.

So, in the product, C1 has Br, C2 has Br and OH.

But wait, that would mean that the product is 2-bromo-1-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, that can't be right because numbering would place the substituents in the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So, Br is before OH. So, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Br and Br, OH on C2? Wait, no, because in the product, the OH is still on C2, and Brs are on C1 and C2.

Wait, but if C2 has both Br and OH, that would be a geminal di-substitution, which is possible.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, options A and D are both this compound but with different stereochemistry.

So, the next question is about the configuration of the Brs.

In the addition of bromine, the Brs add in an anti fashion. So, the Br on C1 and Br on C2 would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the substituents' positions are a bit constrained.

Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring. When the double bond is between C1 and C2, adding Br2 in anti addition would mean that the Br on C1 is on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

So, if the starting material's C1 and C2 are in a certain configuration, the Brs would add trans to each other.

Wait, but the starting material's enol form has the OH on C2. So, the spatial arrangement of the substituents before and after addition is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a trans diastereomer.

But I'm not entirely sure about the stereochemistry here. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a racemic mixture, but I don't think the options suggest that.

So, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R).

Wait, so when Br adds, the configuration depends on how the Br atoms are placed.

Let me try to draw the structure.

Original double bond: C1 and C2 are double bonded. In the enol form, the OH is on C2.

When Br2 adds, the Brs add across the double bond in a trans manner. So, if the double bond is in a certain conformation, the Brs would end up on opposite sides.

But in a cyclopentene, the ring is flat, and the addition would create a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the cyclopentane ring's substituents (Br on C1 and Br on C2) would end up in a cis or trans arrangement.

Wait, considering the chair-like transition state, but cyclopentane isn't a chair, but perhaps it's a boat?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the bromonium ion formation. When the double bond attacks Br2, it forms a bromonium ion, which is a three-membered ring. Then, Br- attacks from the opposite side, leading to trans addition.

In a cyclopentene ring, this would mean that the Brs are added on opposite faces.

But in the product, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be anti. So, if the OH is on C2 in a certain configuration, the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the product would have the Br on C1 as R configuration and Br on C2 as S, or both as R or S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which are enantiomers, but looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R).

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is a simple addition of Br2 to the double bond, the major product would be the trans di-bromide. So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite sides.

In the case of cyclopentane, which is a five-membered ring, the substituents on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) would be trans.

Wait, but in a ring, trans can have specific meanings. For example, if both substituents are axial or equatorial.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration isn't the main issue here, and the main point is the presence of two Brs on C1 and C2.

Looking again at the options, options A and D are the di-bromo ones.

But what about the other options? Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, cyclopentanone with a Br on C2.

Wait, how would that form? If the enol reacts with bromine in a way that the Br adds to the C2, perhaps via electrophilic attack.

Wait, enols can undergo electrophilic attack, but under what conditions? For example, in the presence of acid, the enol is protonated, making it more reactive towards electrophiles.

But wait, the question states that the reaction is with bromine. Bromine is a dienophile, but in other contexts, it can act as an electrophile, especially under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, wait, cyclopentanone has a carbonyl group, but the starting material is an enol, which is the enol form of the ketone.

If the starting material is an enol and reacts with bromine, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, making the alpha position more susceptible to electrophilic attack.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is an enol. Enols can undergo different types of reactions, including addition reactions. But the presence of Br2 suggests it's adding to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a conjugated diene, but no, it's not. It's an enol with a single double bond.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the enol form is less stable, and under the reaction conditions, it tautomerizes to the ketone form. Then, the reaction would be bromination of the ketone.

But wait, the enol is more reactive towards certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the enol isn't stable and quickly tautomerizes to cyclopentanone.

Wait, wait, wait. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, it's the enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Enols can form from ketones via keto-enol tautomerism.

But if the enol is treated with Br2, what would happen?

Another possibility: the enol could undergo an electrophilic addition at the alpha position. Because enols are nucleophilic at the alpha position.

Wait, but bromine is a diatomic molecule. Maybe it can act as an electrophilic bromine source. So, perhaps the alpha position (adjacent to the carbonyl) would undergo bromination.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, which has the OH on C2 and the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

Wait, in the enol form, the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

If bromine adds to the alpha position, it would add to C1 or C3.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could react with Br2 in a conjugate addition, but that's more typical in Diels-Alder reactions, where a diene reacts with a dienophile.

Wait, but in this case, the enol's double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So, the structure is such that C1 is next to the double bond and the ring, and C2 has the OH and is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the Br adds across the double bond, giving a vicinal di-bromide, as I thought before. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Which matches options A and D.

Then, the question is about the configuration of the Brs. If the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite sides.

But in a cyclopentane ring, when two substituents on adjacent carbons are on opposite sides, they are considered trans.

So, the diastereomer formed would have the Br on C1 as R and on C2 as S, or the other way around, depending on the starting structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration would result in both Brs being R.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but looking at the options, A and D are possible.

Wait, another thought: when adding Br2 to a cyclic diene, the most stable product is the one with the trans addition. But in a five-membered ring, the trans addition may be less strained than in a six-membered ring.

Anyway, perhaps the correct product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is either option A or D.

Looking again at the options, A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Hmm, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, leading to a cis arrangement, which would be (1R,2R) or (1S,2S).

But wait, the addition of Br2 is anti, which would lead to the Brs being on opposite faces. So in a ring, this would produce a trans arrangement.

Wait, in a cyclopentane ring, if the Brs are on adjacent carbons and opposite faces, the configuration might be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). So, option A is (1R,2S).

Alternatively, maybe the starting enol has a certain configuration that would influence the outcome.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the enol as having the OH on a certain face.

Let me try to imagine the structure:

- C1 is connected to C2 via a double bond.
- C2 has an OH group on, say, the upper face.
- The ring is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl groups are on C4.

When Br2 adds, the Brs would add across the double bond in a trans manner. So, the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

If the OH is on the upper face of C2, then the Br on C2 would be on the lower face, and the Br on C1 would be on the upper face.

Wait, but that would mean that the Brs are on opposite faces. So, the configuration would be such that C1 is R and C2 is S, for example.

So, option A is (1R,2S), which would fit this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is (1S,2R), but since the options don't have that, and A is (1R,2S), that's the likely option.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, making the configuration (1R,2R), as in option D.

I'm a bit stuck here. Another approach: when adding Br2 to a cyclohexene, the addition is trans, leading to a vicinal di-bromide with Brs on opposite faces, resulting in a trans diastereomer. Similarly, in cyclopentene, the addition would be anti, leading to a trans arrangement.

In the case of the product, the substituents on C1 and C2 (the Brs) would be on opposite faces.

So, in the cyclopentanol product, the Br on C1 and Br on C2 would be on opposite faces, leading to a certain diastereomer.

Now, considering the configuration, if the Br on C1 is on the same face as the OH on C2, that would create a certain stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, (1R,2S).

But wait, another thought: when you add Br2 to a double bond, the Brs add in a trans fashion. So, if the starting material is a ring, the Brs would add in a way that their positions are across from each other.

But in the case where the starting material has the OH on C2, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face to the Br on C1.

So, in the case where the OH is on C2, and the Br on C2 is trans to the Br on C1, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

So, the product would be a diastereomer with Brs on opposite faces, which would match option A or D.

Wait, but the options don't have (1S,2R), so perhaps option A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the major outcome is the di-bromide, with the configuration as option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Another approach: the reaction of enols with bromine. Maybe the reaction isn't addition but substitution.

Wait, but enols are more likely to undergo addition reactions across the double bond, especially with Br2 which is a good dienophile. So, the major product would be the di-bromide.

So, among the options, A and D are the di-bromo products. So, the correct answer is either A or D.

But how to decide between the two?

Well, the addition of Br2 to a double bond would give a vicinal di-bromide with anti stereochemistry.

In the starting enol, the configuration is such that when the Brs add, they end up on opposite sides.

Assuming that the starting enol has a certain configuration, perhaps the product would have both Brs on the same side, making the configuration (1R,2R), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, (1R,2S).

Wait, I'm still not completely confident. Let me think of the possibility of the product. If the product is a di-bromide, then the correct option is either A or D.

But looking again at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Wait, another thought: in the addition of Br2, the bromide ion attacks the less substituted carbon in the bromonium ion. Wait, in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, both of which are part of the ring.

So, the bromide could attack either C1 or C2, but considering the ring's structure, perhaps the attack leads to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs adding in a way that the substituents (Br on C1 and C2) are trans.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe it's better to think about the possible products again.

Another angle: the reaction of an enol with a dienophile like Br2 could lead to a diels-alder type reaction, but I'm not sure if the enol has the necessary diene structure for that. Alternatively, perhaps the enol doesn't act as a diene, and the reaction is a simple dihydroxylation, but that's with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is bromination of the enol via an electrophilic attack. Enols are nucleophilic at the alpha position, so perhaps the Br adds to the alpha carbon.

But the alpha carbon in the enol is C1 and C3. So, perhaps the Br adds to C1 or C3.

Wait, but adding Br to C1 would be possible, leading to a mono-brominated product.

But looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, that's a bromine on C2.

Wait, but that's the same carbon as the OH in the enol. How would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the enol tautomerizes to the ketone (cyclopentanone), and then undergoes bromination at the alpha position.

But the question is about the reaction between the enol and bromine, not the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an enol, which can undergo bromination at the alpha position. So, the enol's alpha carbon would be C1 and C3. So, bromine could add to C1 or C3, leading to a mono-bromide.

But in the options, the mono-bromides are options B and C. Let me look at them.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the bromine is on C2 of the cyclopentanone.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the Br is on C4.

Wait, but the starting material is the enol, which is more reactive towards electrophilic attack at the alpha position.

So, if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then undergoes bromination at C1 or C3, perhaps leading to a product where Br is on C2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Bromine in what solvent? But the question doesn't specify, so I have to assume it's a typical bromine addition.

So, the most likely reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, resulting in a vicinal di-bromide.

Therefore, the product should be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A or D.

Now, the question is the configuration.

Assuming that the addition is anti, meaning that the Brs are on opposite faces.

In a cyclopentane ring, C1 and C2 are adjacent. If the Br on C1 is R and the Br on C2 is S, that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration leads to both Brs being R, as in option D.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement of the starting material, it's hard to decide.

But considering that the enol has a certain configuration, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on opposite sides, resulting in (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

Given the options, the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the ring's structure. Adding Brs in anti fashion would place them on opposite sides. So, if the starting material is such that the OH is on the upper face of C2, then the Br on C1 would be on the upper face, and the Br on C2 would be on the lower face.

Wait, but that would lead to the Br on C1 and C2 being on opposite faces, which would correspond to (1R,2S) if the configurations are R and S, respectively.

But how do I determine R and S?

Alternatively, perhaps the product has both Brs on the same side, leading to (1R,2R) configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Imagine cyclopentane ring. Let's assign positions:

C1 is at the top, connected to C2 and C5.

C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has an OH and Br.

C3 is connected to C2 and C4.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5, with two methyl groups.

C5 is connected to C4 and C1.

The double bond is between C1 and C2 in the starting material.

Adding Br2 across the double bond would place Br on C1 and C2.

Assuming the addition is anti, the Br on C1 is on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

So, if the Br on C1 is on the front face, the Br on C2 is on the back face.

But the OH is on C2. So, the OH's position would influence the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the OH is on the same face as the Br on C1, leading to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on opposite faces, making a trans vicinal di-bromide.

In this case, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), but since the options don't have both, option A is (1R,2S), which is the likely answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, (1R,2R), if the Brs add in a way that they're on the same face.

Wait, but the addition of Br2 is stereospecific, leading to trans addition.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and I'll have to make a decision.

So, the major outcome is the addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to a di-bromo cyclopentanol with a specific stereochemistry. Among the options, the product would be either A or D.

But I'm more confident now that the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is a five-membered cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4. Bromine (Br₂) reacts with the double bond, leading to the addition of Br atoms across the double bond. This addition occurs in an anti fashion, forming a vicinal dibromide.

The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, where Br atoms are added to C1 and C2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti addition of Br₂, resulting in the Br atoms being on opposite sides of the ring. This leads to the (1R,2S) configuration as the major product, as the anti addition places the Br atoms trans to each other.

Among the given options:
- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol matches the expected product with the correct stereochemistry.
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol does not match the stereochemistry expected from anti addition.
- **Options B and C**: These involve mono-brominated products, which are not consistent with the reaction mechanism of Br₂ addition across the double bond.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
