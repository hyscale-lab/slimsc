Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned: constitutional and stereoisomers. Oh wait, stereoisomers include things like enantiomers and diastereomers, right? But the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism, which I think are related to different aspects of structure.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond. It's like keto-enol tautomerism, which occurs in compounds that have adjacent carbonyl groups. For instance, in a diketone, if there are two carbonyl groups next to each other, the compound can undergo tautomerism. But wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent positions of the benzene ring. So, that structure shouldn't allow for keto-enol tautomerism because the necessary proximity for the shift isn't there. Because in tautomerism, the hydrogen has to be adjacent to a carbonyl group, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are across from each other, not adjacent. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, all on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring. So each ketone is next to another, which would allow for tautomerism. Wait, no. Wait, 1,3,5-trione in a cyclohexane ring would have each ketone separated by one carbon. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Hmm, wait, no. The numbering would be 1,3,5, so each is separated by two carbons. Wait, no, 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring would mean each is two carbons apart. So positions 1, 3, and 5 are each next to two other carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 3, 5 are alternate positions. So each is across from each other? No, 1 and 4 would be across. So 1,3,5 are all adjacent to each other in a way that they are spaced two carbons apart. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to picture it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't such that the carbonyl groups are adjacent. So for tautomerism to occur, the molecule should have adjacent carbonyl groups. If the molecule doesn't have that, it can't tautomerize.

So benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but they're on adjacent positions of the benzene ring. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are at positions 1 and 2, right? Because benzoquinone is 1,2-quinone. So the two carbonyl groups are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, no. Benzoquinone is actually a six-membered ring with two ketone groups on opposite positions. So 1,4 positions? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can be either 1,2-diketone (para-quinone?) or 1,4-diketone. No, wait, I think benzoquinone is 1,4-diketone. Let me think: benzene has six positions. If two ketone groups are opposite each other (para positions, 1 and 4), then the structure would have two carbonyls across the ring. So in that case, the two carbonyl groups are across from each other, not adjacent. So for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, maybe the structure doesn't allow for that because the carbonyl groups are too far apart. So tautomerism is possible only when the carbonyls are adjacent, allowing the keto-enol shift. So if the two carbonyls are adjacent, like in 1,2 positions, then tautomerism is possible. But in benzoquinone, which is 1,4, the two are opposite, so no adjacent H and C=O groups. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize. 

So which of the two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, wait. Let's think again. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, so the two ketone groups are opposite each other. So no adjacent C=O groups. Therefore, can't tautomerize. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. 

Wait, but the other compound is 1,3,5-cyclohexane-trione. So in a six-membered ring, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by one carbon. So they are 1,3,5 positions. So each is adjacent to another carbonyl group. Like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but in a ring. So each carbonyl is adjacent to another. So that structure would allow for tautomerism. Because each C=O is next to another C=O, so the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

So for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says part A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then for part A, A is benzoquinone. So the options for A are either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-trione.

So in the options, choices are:

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain rings, can also cause optical activity.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's write its structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is: the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but as an ester, the -OH would be replaced by OMe (methyl). So the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-O-Me. Wait, no. Wait, the formula of 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COO-Me? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid. But as the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. 

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. Let's look for a chiral center. The central carbon (the one attached to the OH) in CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me: what's attached? The central carbon is attached to:

- CH2OH (since it's CH2(OH)), wait no: the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-Me. So the central carbon is the one in the middle, which is CH2. Wait, noâ€”if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The propanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COO-Me? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So:

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-O-Me. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)(H)-COO-Me. 

Wait, the central carbon (the one with the OH) has the following groups attached:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- COO-Me group (from the other side)
- Another H.

So the groups are: CH3, OH, COO-Me, and H. So the central carbon has four different groups? Let's see:

- CH3: a methyl group
- OH: hydroxyl
- COO-Me: the ester group (which is like a carbonyl connected to OMe)
- H: a hydrogen.

So yes, all four are different. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. So fumarate would be the diester, with two ester groups on adjacent carbons. The structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
      O

Wait, more accurately, it's:

CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait: no. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid, which has a double bond between the two central carbons. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
So it's a trans configuration, or is it the cis? Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, so fumarate would be the diester of maleic acid, so it's the cis diester. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. Wait, no, I think I have this mixed up. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, which has the trans configuration.

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. So fumaric acid is trans, so dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
But in a trans configuration, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, in terms of optical activity, do esters of di-carboxylic acids have any? Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is a diester of a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the molecule would be symmetric if the substituents are the same on both sides. Because if you have two ester groups (OCH3) on each end of the double bond, and the double bond is trans, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, let me visualize: the two ester groups are on opposite ends of a double bond. So for the structure O=C-OCH3 on one end and O=C-OCH3 on the other, but on opposite sides. So the molecule would have two identical groups on either side, making it symmetric. Thus, it would not have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral even though it has stereocenters.

Wait, but wait: the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond to another O=C-OCH3, but in trans configuration. So each C in the double bond is connected to two OCH3 groups? Or no, each C in the double bond is connected to one OCH3 and one CH3 group? Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the di-ester. So each C of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So each end is a COOCH3 group, but in a trans configuration.

Wait, in that case, the molecule is symmetric. Because if the two substituents on each C of the double bond are the same, it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate would have a plane of symmetry. For example, in the case of meso-tartaric acid, the molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral due to the plane of symmetry.

So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But with the substituents arranged trans. So each of the two C's in the double bond has two OCH3 groups attached? No, each has one OCH3 group. Wait, noâ€”each C in the double bond is connected to two ester groups. No, wait, each C is in the middle of two ester groups? No, probably each C is connected to one ester group. No, wait, no. Let me get this right.

The acid is fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, dihydroxy butenedioic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? No, wait, no. Let me correct this: 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH? No, that's not right.

Wait, no. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2Câ€“CH2â€“CH2â€“CO2H with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HO2Câ€“CH=CHâ€“CO2H, but in the trans configuration. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents (the COOH groups) are on opposite sides. So when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which would be OMeO-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe, with the substituents on opposite sides.

But wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine it: if you have two identical groups (OCH3) on each end of a trans double bond, the molecule is symmetric. So the structure would be symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is achiral, meaning it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is achiral and doesn't show it.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. If the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetric. Each carbon in the double bond has two OCH3 groups, right? No, each carbon has one OCH3 and one COOCH3 group? No, wait, each carbon of the double bond is attached to one OCH3 group. No, wait, no. Let me think: the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end, but connected via a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups? No, each is attached to one. Wait, maybe it's like this:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
      O

Wait, no, each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to an OCH3 group. So each is O=C-OCH3 on both ends. So because both ends are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, which compound shows optical isomerism? Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does because it has a chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't because it's symmetric and thus achiral.

Putting it all together: A is benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. So for B, that would be the incorrect choice because dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That fits.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait I thought for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism, which matches what option B says.

So the correct option is B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen atom and a double bond shift positions, such as in keto-enol tautomerism. This typically requires adjacent carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on opposite positions of a benzene ring (1,4-quinone). Since the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, tautomerism is not possible.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring, with each carbonyl group separated by one carbon. This arrangement allows for adjacent carbonyl groups, enabling tautomerism.

Thus, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-C(OH)-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The central carbon (C(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, OH, COOCHâ‚ƒ, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure O=C-OCHâ‚ƒ connected by a double bond to another O=C-OCHâ‚ƒ in a trans configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical groups on either side of the double bond, making it achiral and unable to show optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned: constitutional and stereoisomers. Oh wait, stereoisomers include things like enantiomers and diastereomers, right? But the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism, which I think are related to different aspects of structure.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond. It's like keto-enol tautomerism, which occurs in compounds that have adjacent carbonyl groups. For instance, in a diketone, if there are two carbonyl groups next to each other, the compound can undergo tautomerism. But wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent positions of the benzene ring. So, that structure shouldn't allow for keto-enol tautomerism because the necessary proximity for the shift isn't there. Because in tautomerism, the hydrogen has to be adjacent to a carbonyl group, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are across from each other, not adjacent. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, all on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring. So each ketone is next to another, which would allow for tautomerism. Wait, no. Wait, 1,3,5-trione in a cyclohexane ring would have each ketone separated by one carbon. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Hmm, wait, no. The numbering would be 1,3,5, so each is separated by two carbons. Wait, no, 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring would mean each is two carbons apart. So positions 1, 3, and 5 are each next to two other carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 3, 5 are alternate positions. So each is across from each other? No, 1 and 4 would be across. So 1,3,5 are all adjacent to each other in a way that they are spaced two carbons apart. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to picture it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't such that the carbonyl groups are adjacent. So for tautomerism to occur, the molecule should have adjacent carbonyl groups. If the molecule doesn't have that, it can't tautomerize.

So benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but they're on adjacent positions of the benzene ring. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are at positions 1 and 2, right? Because benzoquinone is 1,2-quinone. So the two carbonyl groups are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, no. Benzoquinone is actually a six-membered ring with two ketone groups on opposite positions. So 1,4 positions? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can be either 1,2-diketone (para-quinone?) or 1,4-diketone. No, wait, I think benzoquinone is 1,4-diketone. Let me think: benzene has six positions. If two ketone groups are opposite each other (para positions, 1 and 4), then the structure would have two carbonyls across the ring. So in that case, the two carbonyl groups are across from each other, not adjacent. So for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, maybe the structure doesn't allow for that because the carbonyl groups are too far apart. So tautomerism is possible only when the carbonyls are adjacent, allowing the keto-enol shift. So if the two carbonyls are adjacent, like in 1,2 positions, then tautomerism is possible. But in benzoquinone, which is 1,4, the two are opposite, so no adjacent H and C=O groups. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize. 

So which of the two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, wait. Let's think again. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, so the two ketone groups are opposite each other. So no adjacent C=O groups. Therefore, can't tautomerize. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. 

Wait, but the other compound is 1,3,5-cyclohexane-trione. So in a six-membered ring, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by one carbon. So they are 1,3,5 positions. So each is adjacent to another carbonyl group. Like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but in a ring. So each carbonyl is adjacent to another. So that structure would allow for tautomerism. Because each C=O is next to another C=O, so the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

So for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says part A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then for part A, A is benzoquinone. So the options for A are either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-trione.

So in the options, choices are:

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain rings, can also cause optical activity.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's write its structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is: the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but as an ester, the -OH would be replaced by OMe (methyl). So the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-O-Me. Wait, no. Wait, the formula of 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COO-Me? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid. But as the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. 

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. Let's look for a chiral center. The central carbon (the one attached to the OH) in CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me: what's attached? The central carbon is attached to:

- CH2OH (since it's CH2(OH)), wait no: the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-Me. So the central carbon is the one in the middle, which is CH2. Wait, noâ€”if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The propanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COO-Me? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So:

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-O-Me. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)(H)-COO-Me. 

Wait, the central carbon (the one with the OH) has the following groups attached:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- COO-Me group (from the other side)
- Another H.

So the groups are: CH3, OH, COO-Me, and H. So the central carbon has four different groups? Let's see:

- CH3: a methyl group
- OH: hydroxyl
- COO-Me: the ester group (which is like a carbonyl connected to OMe)
- H: a hydrogen.

So yes, all four are different. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. So fumarate would be the diester, with two ester groups on adjacent carbons. The structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
      O

Wait, more accurately, it's:

CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait: no. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid, which has a double bond between the two central carbons. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
So it's a trans configuration, or is it the cis? Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, so fumarate would be the diester of maleic acid, so it's the cis diester. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. Wait, no, I think I have this mixed up. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, which has the trans configuration.

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. So fumaric acid is trans, so dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
But in a trans configuration, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, in terms of optical activity, do esters of di-carboxylic acids have any? Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is a diester of a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the molecule would be symmetric if the substituents are the same on both sides. Because if you have two ester groups (OCH3) on each end of the double bond, and the double bond is trans, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, let me visualize: the two ester groups are on opposite ends of a double bond. So for the structure O=C-OCH3 on one end and O=C-OCH3 on the other, but on opposite sides. So the molecule would have two identical groups on either side, making it symmetric. Thus, it would not have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral even though it has stereocenters.

Wait, but wait: the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond to another O=C-OCH3, but in trans configuration. So each C in the double bond is connected to two OCH3 groups? Or no, each C in the double bond is connected to one OCH3 and one CH3 group? Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the di-ester. So each C of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So each end is a COOCH3 group, but in a trans configuration.

Wait, in that case, the molecule is symmetric. Because if the two substituents on each C of the double bond are the same, it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate would have a plane of symmetry. For example, in the case of meso-tartaric acid, the molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral due to the plane of symmetry.

So in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But with the substituents arranged trans. So each of the two C's in the double bond has two OCH3 groups attached? No, each has one OCH3 group. Wait, noâ€”each C in the double bond is connected to two ester groups. No, wait, each C is in the middle of two ester groups? No, probably each C is connected to one ester group. No, wait, no. Let me get this right.

The acid is fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, dihydroxy butenedioic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? No, wait, no. Let me correct this: 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH? No, that's not right.

Wait, no. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2Câ€“CH2â€“CH2â€“CO2H with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HO2Câ€“CH=CHâ€“CO2H, but in the trans configuration. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents (the COOH groups) are on opposite sides. So when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which would be OMeO-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe, with the substituents on opposite sides.

But wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine it: if you have two identical groups (OCH3) on each end of a trans double bond, the molecule is symmetric. So the structure would be symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is achiral, meaning it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is achiral and doesn't show it.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. If the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetric. Each carbon in the double bond has two OCH3 groups, right? No, each carbon has one OCH3 and one COOCH3 group? No, wait, each carbon of the double bond is attached to one OCH3 group. No, wait, no. Let me think: the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end, but connected via a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups? No, each is attached to one. Wait, maybe it's like this:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
      O

Wait, no, each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to an OCH3 group. So each is O=C-OCH3 on both ends. So because both ends are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, which compound shows optical isomerism? Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does because it has a chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't because it's symmetric and thus achiral.

Putting it all together: A is benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. So for B, that would be the incorrect choice because dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That fits.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait I thought for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism, which matches what option B says.

So the correct option is B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen atom and a double bond shift positions, such as in keto-enol tautomerism. This typically requires adjacent carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on opposite positions of a benzene ring (1,4-quinone). Since the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, tautomerism is not possible.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring, with each carbonyl group separated by one carbon. This arrangement allows for adjacent carbonyl groups, enabling tautomerism.

Thus, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-C(OH)-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The central carbon (C(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, OH, COOCHâ‚ƒ, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure O=C-OCHâ‚ƒ connected by a double bond to another O=C-OCHâ‚ƒ in a trans configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical groups on either side of the double bond, making it achiral and unable to show optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.
