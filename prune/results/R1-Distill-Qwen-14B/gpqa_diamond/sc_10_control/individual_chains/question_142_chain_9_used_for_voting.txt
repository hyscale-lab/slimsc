Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is located in the qubits space. The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. 

Wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. So, the density matrix given must correspond to a point in this space.

First, let's break down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because |0><0| is a projector, and same with |1><1|. So ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

Wait, but wait, the density matrix for a pure state would have trace 1 and be idempotent (ρ² = ρ). Let me check. For the given ρ, trace is (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1, which is correct. But what about ρ squared? Let's compute ρ².

ρ squared would be (1/2)^2 (|0><0| + |1><1|)². But when you square this, the cross terms would be |0><0| |1><1|, which is |0><1| and |1><0|. But wait, no, actually when you multiply |0><0| with |1><1|, the product is 0 because <0|1> is zero. So each term squares to itself, and the cross terms vanish. So ρ² is (1/4)(|0> <0| + |1> <1| + |0><1| + |1><0| )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no—no, when you square (A + B), it's A² + AB + BA + B². But in this case, A is |0><0| and B is |1><1|. So A² is |0><0|, same with B². AB is |0><0||1><1| which is zero because <0|1> is 0. Similarly BA is zero. So ρ² = (1/2)^2 (A + B)^2 = (1/4)(A + B) = (1/4)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (1/4)(2ρ) )? Wait, no, because ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So ρ² is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/4. But ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So ρ² = (ρ)/2. Therefore, ρ² is not equal to ρ. So ρ is not a pure state.

That makes sense because it's a mixture of two orthogonal pure states. So it's a mixed state, and in the Bloch sphere, it's somewhere inside, not on the surface.

Now, what's the Bloch vector for a density matrix? I remember that any 2x2 density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). 

So let's write ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is the same as [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2. 

Wait, so ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. So the Bloch vector r would be (0, 0, 0). Because (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 = ρ. In this case, ρ is I/2, so all the r components must be zero. So the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

Alternatively, I can think about the density matrix as a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 1/2 probability. So the expectation value for any Pauli matrix would be zero. Because for Pauli matrices, the expectation values of |0> are zero except for σ_z, which is +1 for |0> and -1 for |1>. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. No, ρ is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So the expectation value for σ_x would be ( (0.5)(<0|σ_x|0>) ) + 0.5(<1|σ_x|1>). But σ_x swaps |0> and |1>, so <0|σ_x|0> is <0|1> which is 0. Same for σ_y. And for σ_z, <0|σ_z|0> is +1, <1|σ_z|1> is -1. So 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(-1) = 0. So all the components of the Bloch vector are zero, so the point is at the origin.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). Since the matrix is a mixture of orthogonal pure states, it describes a mixed state, not a pure state. The Bloch sphere provides a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states lie on the surface and mixed states lie inside.

To determine the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the Bloch sphere, we express \(\rho\) in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), we observe that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the qubits space is at \((0, 0, 0)\).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Since the matrix is a mixture of orthogonal pure states, it describes a mixed state, not a pure state. The Bloch sphere provides a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states lie on the surface and mixed states lie inside.

To determine the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the Bloch sphere, we express \(\rho\) in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), we observe that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the qubits space is at \((0, 0, 0)\).
