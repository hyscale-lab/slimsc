Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the information carefully. So, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. There are four options given.

First, looking at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100% abundant. Then there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, I remember that molecular ions can sometimes lose or gain a small fragment. The difference between 158 and 156 is 2, which suggests maybe there's a chlorine involved because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35.5. Wait, but wait—no, 158 minus 156 is 2, which could be a Cl and a H, but wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is for a molecule with Cl, and the 158 is the M+2 peak because Cl has an isotope at about 37. So, the molecular formula likely includes a Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which typically indicates O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 could suggest a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches broad from 2500-3300 and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde might have a carbonyl. But the broad peak could also suggest an alcohol, but then the carbonyl is strong. Let me think—maybe a carboxylic acid?

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, likely from a carboxylic acid (-COOH) because those protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR data, it's a singlet, which suggests no neighboring protons. In a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually broad, but sometimes it can be a singlet if it's deuterated or if it's in a different environment. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, 11 is higher, which is more typical of carboxylic acid OH. But then, the OH in a carboxylic acid sometimes appears as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's exchanged or in a different solvent.

Looking further at the NMR: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are aromatic protons, showing up as doublets. The coupling suggests two sets of two protons each, which could be from a para-substituted ring. If the substituents are in the para positions, the protons would be two doublets of doublets, but in this case, each is a doublet, which implies two protons each. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in para positions, giving two doublets. For example, a benzene ring with a Cl and a COOH group in the para positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. But aldehyde protons are usually lower than 11 ppm. So more likely, the 11 ppm is a COOH proton.

Putting this together, the molecule is likely a chlorobenzoic acid. So looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

So, the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents would be para to each other. The benzoic acid group would be at position 1, and Cl at position 4. So the protons on the ring would be in positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent, and 3 and 5, which are equivalent. Wait, no. If the substituents are at 4 and 1 positions, then the ring would have two sets of two protons each. The H at position 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the Cl, and the H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the COOH. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me draw it out mentally.

Benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1. If the Cl is at position 4 (para to COOH), then the ring would have two H's next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two H's next to COOH (positions 3 and 5). Each of these sets would be equivalent and would couple with each other, leading to a doublet. So in the NMR, 8.02 ppm could be the two H's adjacent to Cl (since Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the protons, making them appear downfield), and 7.72 could be the H's adjacent to the COOH group, which is also an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but both substituents are para, so how would that affect the chemical shifts?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. Like if the COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 2, but then the NMR would have more complex splitting. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So, a para-substituted ring makes sense because each pair is equivalent.

So, looking at 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two sets of protons: the ones adjacent to Cl (downfield shifted) and the ones adjacent to COOH (also downfield, but perhaps less so). Alternatively, since COOH is a strong EWG, the protons adjacent to it would be more deshielded than those adjacent to Cl. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact shifts, but the positions are important.

Wait, in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm is a doublet, and 7.72 is another doublet. How does that come about? Let's think: if the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then the H's at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl) would be in one environment, and H's at 3 and 5 (adjacent to COOH) in another. Each pair would be equivalent and have their own coupling.

In that scenario, the H's next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than those next to COOH? Or the opposite? Actually, Cl is a weaker EWG compared to COOH. Wait, COOH is a strong EWG, so the protons next to it (3 and 5) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. Cl is also an EWG, but perhaps not as strong. So 3 and 5 H's would be downfield more than 2 and 6. So the 8.02 ppm could be the H's next to Cl, and 7.72 the H's next to COOH. But wait, that would suggest that the Cl is causing a larger deshielding than the COOH, which may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Let's say the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then, the H's at 2 and 6 are each ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. The H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl.

In such a case, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are more deshielded due to the strong EWG effect of COOH. Wait, no, because COOH is at position 1, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent (meta) to COOH, not ortho. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH. Similarly, the H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me number the benzene ring. COOH is at position 1. Then, position 2 is adjacent (ortho), position 3 is meta, position 4 para, etc. So, if Cl is at position 4, then the H at position 2 is ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps the key is that the two sets of doublets in NMR suggest a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each causing their own environment.

So, looking at the NMR data again: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). Let's think about substituents in para positions. If the substituents are meta, then the coupling would be different. But para substituents would lead to two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet.

Another thought: the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which is likely the COOH proton. But wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH would be in one position, and Cl in another. So, in NMR, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. But in the given data, it's a singlet. Could it be that the sample is in a different state, like deprotonated? No, because the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests O-H stretching—so it's likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would usually be a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Maybe it's an exchange with D2O or something, but the question says it's a white solid, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another option: maybe the molecule is an ester. But then the IR peak at 1720 would be consistent with an ester carbonyl. But the NMR would have different features. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, option C is Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be OCl-CO-O-Ph? Or Cl-CO-O-Ph? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, in the NMR, the carbonyl would be an ester, and the protons on the benzene ring would be in certain positions.

In phenyl chloroformate, the substituents are OCOCl and O attached to the ring. Wait, no—phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So, the benzene ring is connected to an OCOCl group. So, the benzene ring would have substituents at the ortho and para positions relative to the OCOCl group.

Wait, no, in that structure, the benzene ring is connected via an ester oxygen. So, the substituent is OCOCl attached to the benzene. So, the benzene ring would have that group in one position. Then, the other substituents would be as per the structure. But in that case, the NMR would have a singlet for the aromatic protons ortho and para to the substituent, but perhaps as multiplets.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. In phenyl chloroformate, the substituent is OCOCl. Let's imagine it's attached to the benzene ring at position 1. Then, the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent (ortho) to the substituent, and the H at 3,4,5 would be in other positions. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a strong EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But the NMR in the problem shows two doublets. So, perhaps the substituent is in such a position that the ring protons split into two sets of doublets. Maybe the substituent is in position 1, then the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho) would be one set, and the H's at 3 and 5 (meta) another. Wait, but that would give two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring has two para substituents? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring has two substituents, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe looking at the options can help. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows 11 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So this option might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl at position 4 (para). So, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6 positions. H2 and H6 (ortho to Cl) would be deshielded; H3 and H5 (ortho to COOH) would also be deshielded. Therefore, in the NMR, they'd show up as two doublets. The COOH proton would be a singlet at around 11 ppm, but in reality, it's usually a broad peak. Maybe in this case, it's a singlet due to exchange or other factors. So this could fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR. The NMR would have aromatic protons. The substituent is strong EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded. If the substituent is in position 1, then H2 and H6 are ortho, H3 and H5 are meta. H4 is para. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 1. So H2 and H6 would be adjacent, and H3 and H5 would be next to H2 and H6. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, but I'm not sure. The NMR for phenyl chloroformate would not have a singlet at 11 ppm, because that's the COOH in option B. So, option C's NMR wouldn't have that.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl at position 2 (ortho to COOH). So, the substituents are at position 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). Then, the H's at position 3 and 6 would be next to Cl and COOH. H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and meta to COOH (position 1). H6 is adjacent to COOH and meta to Cl. The H4 and H5 would be in other positions. But in this case, the aromatic protons might show more splitting because of the proximity of substituents. Would the NMR show two doublets? Let me think. If the substituents are at 1 and 2, then the H's at positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH, respectively. The H at position 4 would be para to substituent, but perhaps that's not relevant. Wait, this might lead to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet or something else. So, perhaps the NMR for option D would not show two simple doublets but more complex coupling.

So, going back. The NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two Hs. That suggests a para-substituted ring with two substituents. So, option B fits this scenario as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Additionally, the mass spectrum: molecular ion at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32= 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, which matches. The M+2 peak is at 158, which is 156 +2. This is consistent with the presence of Cl, as Cl has an isotope at 37 (about 30% abundance), so M+2 would be (35Cl and 37Cl) but wait, I think Cl has an approximate 75% abundance of 35Cl and 25% of 37Cl. Wait, no, the natural abundance of 35Cl is about 75%, and 37Cl is about 25%. So, the molecular ion would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The abundance of M is 100%, but wait, if it's a single isotope? No, wait, the molecular ion in mass spec is for the most abundant isotope (35Cl), which is 100% of the molecular ion. Then, the M+2 peak is at 158, which is 37Cl, and the abundance is 32%, which corresponds to the natural abundance of 37Cl (about 24.1%, so 32% is close). So, this supports option B.

The IR: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, which fits with the carboxylic acid or an ester. But since the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm, the carboxylic acid is more likely.

Putting all this together, the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The key spectral observations and their implications are as follows:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This corresponds to the most abundant isotope of the molecule, likely containing chlorine (Cl), as its natural abundance is 75% (atomic mass ~35).
- **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: This is consistent with the presence of chlorine, as the M+2 peak arises from the 37Cl isotope (natural abundance ~25%).

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, characteristic of a carboxylic acid.
- **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.

### Proton NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet in the aromatic region, likely corresponding to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains an aldehyde proton, which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. However, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, more consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of 156.5, matching the molecular ion peak.  
   - The IR spectrum is consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - The NMR shows two doublets (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), corresponding to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 11 ppm matches the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid.  
   - This option fits all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-Ph), which would produce a carbonyl peak in the IR around 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - However, the NMR does not show a singlet at 11 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group and chlorine in the ortho position.  
   - The aromatic protons would exhibit more complex splitting patterns due to the proximity of the substituents, inconsistent with the two simple doublets observed in the NMR.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. 

Answer: B

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the information carefully. So, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. There are four options given.

First, looking at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100% abundant. Then there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, I remember that molecular ions can sometimes lose or gain a small fragment. The difference between 158 and 156 is 2, which suggests maybe there's a chlorine involved because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35.5. Wait, but wait—no, 158 minus 156 is 2, which could be a Cl and a H, but wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is for a molecule with Cl, and the 158 is the M+2 peak because Cl has an isotope at about 37. So, the molecular formula likely includes a Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which typically indicates O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 could suggest a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches broad from 2500-3300 and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde might have a carbonyl. But the broad peak could also suggest an alcohol, but then the carbonyl is strong. Let me think—maybe a carboxylic acid?

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, likely from a carboxylic acid (-COOH) because those protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR data, it's a singlet, which suggests no neighboring protons. In a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually broad, but sometimes it can be a singlet if it's deuterated or if it's in a different environment. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, 11 is higher, which is more typical of carboxylic acid OH. But then, the OH in a carboxylic acid sometimes appears as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's exchanged or in a different solvent.

Looking further at the NMR: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are aromatic protons, showing up as doublets. The coupling suggests two sets of two protons each, which could be from a para-substituted ring. If the substituents are in the para positions, the protons would be two doublets of doublets, but in this case, each is a doublet, which implies two protons each. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in para positions, giving two doublets. For example, a benzene ring with a Cl and a COOH group in the para positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. But aldehyde protons are usually lower than 11 ppm. So more likely, the 11 ppm is a COOH proton.

Putting this together, the molecule is likely a chlorobenzoic acid. So looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

So, the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents would be para to each other. The benzoic acid group would be at position 1, and Cl at position 4. So the protons on the ring would be in positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent, and 3 and 5, which are equivalent. Wait, no. If the substituents are at 4 and 1 positions, then the ring would have two sets of two protons each. The H at position 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the Cl, and the H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the COOH. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me draw it out mentally.

Benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1. If the Cl is at position 4 (para to COOH), then the ring would have two H's next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two H's next to COOH (positions 3 and 5). Each of these sets would be equivalent and would couple with each other, leading to a doublet. So in the NMR, 8.02 ppm could be the two H's adjacent to Cl (since Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the protons, making them appear downfield), and 7.72 could be the H's adjacent to the COOH group, which is also an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but both substituents are para, so how would that affect the chemical shifts?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. Like if the COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 2, but then the NMR would have more complex splitting. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So, a para-substituted ring makes sense because each pair is equivalent.

So, looking at 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two sets of protons: the ones adjacent to Cl (downfield shifted) and the ones adjacent to COOH (also downfield, but perhaps less so). Alternatively, since COOH is a strong EWG, the protons adjacent to it would be more deshielded than those adjacent to Cl. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact shifts, but the positions are important.

Wait, in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm is a doublet, and 7.72 is another doublet. How does that come about? Let's think: if the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then the H's at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl) would be in one environment, and H's at 3 and 5 (adjacent to COOH) in another. Each pair would be equivalent and have their own coupling.

In that scenario, the H's next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than those next to COOH? Or the opposite? Actually, Cl is a weaker EWG compared to COOH. Wait, COOH is a strong EWG, so the protons next to it (3 and 5) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. Cl is also an EWG, but perhaps not as strong. So 3 and 5 H's would be downfield more than 2 and 6. So the 8.02 ppm could be the H's next to Cl, and 7.72 the H's next to COOH. But wait, that would suggest that the Cl is causing a larger deshielding than the COOH, which may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Let's say the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then, the H's at 2 and 6 are each ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. The H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl.

In such a case, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are more deshielded due to the strong EWG effect of COOH. Wait, no, because COOH is at position 1, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent (meta) to COOH, not ortho. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH. Similarly, the H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me number the benzene ring. COOH is at position 1. Then, position 2 is adjacent (ortho), position 3 is meta, position 4 para, etc. So, if Cl is at position 4, then the H at position 2 is ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps the key is that the two sets of doublets in NMR suggest a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each causing their own environment.

So, looking at the NMR data again: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). Let's think about substituents in para positions. If the substituents are meta, then the coupling would be different. But para substituents would lead to two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet.

Another thought: the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which is likely the COOH proton. But wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH would be in one position, and Cl in another. So, in NMR, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. But in the given data, it's a singlet. Could it be that the sample is in a different state, like deprotonated? No, because the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests O-H stretching—so it's likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would usually be a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Maybe it's an exchange with D2O or something, but the question says it's a white solid, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another option: maybe the molecule is an ester. But then the IR peak at 1720 would be consistent with an ester carbonyl. But the NMR would have different features. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, option C is Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be OCl-CO-O-Ph? Or Cl-CO-O-Ph? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, in the NMR, the carbonyl would be an ester, and the protons on the benzene ring would be in certain positions.

In phenyl chloroformate, the substituents are OCOCl and O attached to the ring. Wait, no—phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So, the benzene ring is connected to an OCOCl group. So, the benzene ring would have substituents at the ortho and para positions relative to the OCOCl group.

Wait, no, in that structure, the benzene ring is connected via an ester oxygen. So, the substituent is OCOCl attached to the benzene. So, the benzene ring would have that group in one position. Then, the other substituents would be as per the structure. But in that case, the NMR would have a singlet for the aromatic protons ortho and para to the substituent, but perhaps as multiplets.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. In phenyl chloroformate, the substituent is OCOCl. Let's imagine it's attached to the benzene ring at position 1. Then, the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent (ortho) to the substituent, and the H at 3,4,5 would be in other positions. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a strong EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But the NMR in the problem shows two doublets. So, perhaps the substituent is in such a position that the ring protons split into two sets of doublets. Maybe the substituent is in position 1, then the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho) would be one set, and the H's at 3 and 5 (meta) another. Wait, but that would give two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring has two para substituents? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring has two substituents, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe looking at the options can help. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows 11 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So this option might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl at position 4 (para). So, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6 positions. H2 and H6 (ortho to Cl) would be deshielded; H3 and H5 (ortho to COOH) would also be deshielded. Therefore, in the NMR, they'd show up as two doublets. The COOH proton would be a singlet at around 11 ppm, but in reality, it's usually a broad peak. Maybe in this case, it's a singlet due to exchange or other factors. So this could fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR. The NMR would have aromatic protons. The substituent is strong EWG, so the ortho protons would be deshielded. If the substituent is in position 1, then H2 and H6 are ortho, H3 and H5 are meta. H4 is para. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 1. So H2 and H6 would be adjacent, and H3 and H5 would be next to H2 and H6. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, but I'm not sure. The NMR for phenyl chloroformate would not have a singlet at 11 ppm, because that's the COOH in option B. So, option C's NMR wouldn't have that.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl at position 2 (ortho to COOH). So, the substituents are at position 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). Then, the H's at position 3 and 6 would be next to Cl and COOH. H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and meta to COOH (position 1). H6 is adjacent to COOH and meta to Cl. The H4 and H5 would be in other positions. But in this case, the aromatic protons might show more splitting because of the proximity of substituents. Would the NMR show two doublets? Let me think. If the substituents are at 1 and 2, then the H's at positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH, respectively. The H at position 4 would be para to substituent, but perhaps that's not relevant. Wait, this might lead to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet or something else. So, perhaps the NMR for option D would not show two simple doublets but more complex coupling.

So, going back. The NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two Hs. That suggests a para-substituted ring with two substituents. So, option B fits this scenario as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Additionally, the mass spectrum: molecular ion at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32= 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, which matches. The M+2 peak is at 158, which is 156 +2. This is consistent with the presence of Cl, as Cl has an isotope at 37 (about 30% abundance), so M+2 would be (35Cl and 37Cl) but wait, I think Cl has an approximate 75% abundance of 35Cl and 25% of 37Cl. Wait, no, the natural abundance of 35Cl is about 75%, and 37Cl is about 25%. So, the molecular ion would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The abundance of M is 100%, but wait, if it's a single isotope? No, wait, the molecular ion in mass spec is for the most abundant isotope (35Cl), which is 100% of the molecular ion. Then, the M+2 peak is at 158, which is 37Cl, and the abundance is 32%, which corresponds to the natural abundance of 37Cl (about 24.1%, so 32% is close). So, this supports option B.

The IR: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, which fits with the carboxylic acid or an ester. But since the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm, the carboxylic acid is more likely.

Putting all this together, the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The key spectral observations and their implications are as follows:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This corresponds to the most abundant isotope of the molecule, likely containing chlorine (Cl), as its natural abundance is 75% (atomic mass ~35).
- **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: This is consistent with the presence of chlorine, as the M+2 peak arises from the 37Cl isotope (natural abundance ~25%).

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, characteristic of a carboxylic acid.
- **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.

### Proton NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet in the aromatic region, likely corresponding to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains an aldehyde proton, which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. However, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, more consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of 156.5, matching the molecular ion peak.  
   - The IR spectrum is consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - The NMR shows two doublets (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), corresponding to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 11 ppm matches the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid.  
   - This option fits all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-Ph), which would produce a carbonyl peak in the IR around 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - However, the NMR does not show a singlet at 11 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group and chlorine in the ortho position.  
   - The aromatic protons would exhibit more complex splitting patterns due to the proximity of the substituents, inconsistent with the two simple doublets observed in the NMR.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.
