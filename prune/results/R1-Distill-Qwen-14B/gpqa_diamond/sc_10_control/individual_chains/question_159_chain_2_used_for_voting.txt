Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to figure it out.

So the question says that observations of a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that quasars often have emission lines, and sometimes when we observe them, their spectrum can be broad because of their high velocities. But wait, the peak being at 790 nm - what does that signify? Oh right, the peak might be from a specific emission line, like the Lyman-alpha line or something else. Wait, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm, which is in the UV. But wait, if the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790, maybe it's a redward shift? Or perhaps it's a Lyman break? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, quasars have strong emission lines. If the peak is in the near-infrared, maybe the quasar is so far away that its UV emission has been redshifted into the infrared. The Lyman break is a feature where the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than about 90 nm because the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium absorbs that. But wait, if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, that would imply a significant redshift.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm. If the quasar's emission line is observed at 790 nm, that would mean it's been redshifted by a factor of z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 ≈ 6.528. So z is about 5.528. Wait, that's a high redshift, which suggests it's very far away.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Oh, right, the comoving distance is the distance between two points at the same time (co-moving with the expansion of the universe). The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters.

The given cosmological parameters are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m = 0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_k = 0). So with these parameters, we can compute the comoving distance for a redshift z.

I need to find the comoving distance D_c for z ≈ 5.5. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, no, E(z) is the expansion factor. Let me think: the integral is ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^3? No, wait, dark energy density doesn't scale with (1+z)^3. Because dark energy is a cosmological constant, its density stays the same. So Omega_lambda is constant, while Omega_m scales as (1+z)^3.

So E(z) = [Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda]^0.5. So the integral is from 0 to z of dz' / E(z').

So I need to calculate the integral of 1/E(z') dz' from z'=0 to z=5.5. Hmmm. I don't remember the exact integral off the top of my head, but I know that for high redshifts, the integral is dominated by the matter density. At high z, (1+z) is large, so Omega_m*(1+z)^3 becomes much larger than Omega_lambda. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3) = (1+z)^{3/2} * sqrt(Omega_m). So 1/E(z) ≈ (1+z)^{-3/2} / sqrt(Omega_m).

But to get the precise value, I think I'll need to use an approximation or a lookup table. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to use a known approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe with Omega_m and Omega_lambda.

I remember that for z << 1, the comoving distance can be approximated with D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1 + (1 - q0)/2 z), where q0 is the deceleration parameter. But q0 is related to the cosmological parameters. Wait, q0 = (Omega_m/2) - Omega_lambda. But with our parameters, Omega_m is 0.3 and Omega_lambda is 0.7, so q0 = (0.3/2) - 0.7 = 0.15 - 0.7 = -0.55. So for small z, that approximation would be useful, but z=5.5 is not small. So that approach won't work here.

Another approach is to use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe dominated by dark energy or matter. For high redshifts, when matter dominates (z >> 1), the comoving distance scales roughly as (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1+z)^{3/2} / sqrt(Omega_m). Let's plug in z=5.5:

(1+z) = 6.5 → (6.5)^(3/2) = sqrt(6.5^3) = sqrt(274.625) ≈ 16.568.

So D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * 16.568 / sqrt(0.3). Let's compute each part.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So (c/H0) = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by (2/3) → 4285.7 * (2/3) ≈ 2857 Mpc.

Then multiply by 16.568 → 2857 * 16.568 ≈ let's see, 2857 * 16 is 45,712, and 2857 * 0.568 is about 1,625. So total around 47,337 Mpc.

Then divide by sqrt(0.3). sqrt(0.3) is about 0.5477. So 47337 / 0.5477 ≈ roughly 86,300 Mpc.

Wait, but 86,300 Mpc is 86.3 gigaparsecs. But wait, that's way larger than the given options, which are up to 9 Gpc. So something's wrong with my approach. Maybe the high-z assumption isn't correct here? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me think again. The standard formula for comoving distance when matter dominates (z >> 1) is D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1+z)^(3/2) / sqrt(Omega_m). Did I get that right?

Wait, no, I think I might have confused the factors. Let me double-check the formula for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe. The comoving distance is (c/H0) * (2/(3 H0)) * (a_0/a)^(3/2) ) * [some factors], but perhaps I'm mixing terms.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps I should use a cosmology calculator or known look-up tables. But since I can't do that right now, maybe I can recall that for z=1, the comoving distance in this cosmology is about 2 Gpc (but I'm not sure). Wait, no, for z=1, the comoving distance is around 2 Gpc when H0 is 70. Wait, no, wait: for H0=70, 1/H0 is about 14 billion years. So 1/H0 in Mpc is roughly 14e9 yr * c (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) → 14e9 * 3e5 /70 → (14/70)*3e5 *1e9 yr → 0.2 *3e5 *1e9 → 6e13 Mpc·yr. But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula from some standard textbooks. I recall that for a flat universe with Omega_m and Omega_lambda, the comoving distance for a given redshift can be approximated using certain integrals. However, without computational tools, I might have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm suggests that the emission line is redshifted into the infrared. If the rest wavelength is, say, 121 nm (Lyman alpha), then the redshift z is (790/121) -1 ≈ 6.52 -1 = 5.52. So z≈5.5.

Now, I need to compute the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a universe with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

I remember that for such parameters, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. The comoving distance for z=5.5 would be roughly higher than the age of the universe times the speed of light, but wait, that's not correct because comoving distance is not the same as the light travel distance.

Wait, no. The comoving distance is related to the expansion during the light's journey. So for z=5.5, the comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), with E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Hmm, I think I can approximate the integral numerically. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Let me compute E(z) at various points between 0 and 5.5 to approximate the integral.

But without doing a detailed calculation, perhaps I can recall that for z=5.5, the comoving distance in a flat universe with these parameters is approximately 10 Gpc. But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because my earlier rough calculation gave around 86 Gpc, which is way higher than the options. That suggests I did a mistake in scaling.

Wait another thought: perhaps the peak is not from Lyman alpha but another line. Let's calculate the possible rest wavelength.

Suppose the observed peak is at 790 nm, and it's due to a certain emission line. Let's say it's the Lyman break, which is a drop in flux below about 90 nm in the rest frame. Wait, but if the peak is at 790, which is longer than 90, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series; maybe it's the Lyman-beta line at 102.6 nm. Then z = (790 / 102.6) -1 ≈ 7.7→ z≈6.67.

Hmm, but that would make it even higher.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from something else, like the Balmer series. The Balmer-alpha line is at 656 nm in the rest frame. So if observed at 790, z=(790/656) -1≈ 1.203. So z≈1.2. That's a much lower redshift. Then, the comoving distance would be different.

Wait, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths than 790. So if the rest frame is 656, observed at 790, then shorter wavelengths (in the observed frame) are bluer than 790, so that's 790 nm to shorter, which corresponds to higher wavelengths in the rest frame. Wait, but wait, H-alpha is at 656 nm. If the quasar emits H-alpha, and it's observed at 790, that's a redshift of (790/656)=1.204. So z≈1.2.

So that's a much more reasonable redshift, and the comoving distance for z=1.2 in this cosmology is about 2 Gpc. But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a near-infrared emission line, not optical.

Wait, another possibility: the peak is from the C IV emission line. Let me think, C IV is around 155 nm. So observed at 790, z=(790/155) -1 ≈ 4.77. So z≈4.77.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Mg II emission line, which is about 279 nm. Observed at 790, z=(790/279)-1≈2.8.

So in that case, z≈2.8. Then, the comoving distance for z≈3 is about 3 Gpc? Or wait, let me think.

Wait, I think I need a better approach. I should use a cosmology calculator or recall the formula for comoving distance.

The comoving distance D_c is given by:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / E(z')

with E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

But without the exact integral, maybe I can use an approximate formula or a known value.

I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is approximately 2 Gpc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for E(z) when z is not too high.

Alternatively, I can use the look-up table from the standard textbooks or online sources. But since I can't access that, I'll have to think.

Wait, I found that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is about 10 Gpc. But the options go up to 9 Gpc. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the redshift is lower.

Wait, the problem says that the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at wavelengths <790 nm. So perhaps the quasar's spectrum is dropping into the UV? Which is absorbed by the intergalactic medium beyond a certain wavelength (the Lyman break). So perhaps the quasar's own emission is in the UV, but beyond a certain wavelength, the flux drops due to the IGM's absorption. So the peak at 790 nm would be the Lyman limit (91 nm rest frame) redshifted.

Wait, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, that's the Lyman limit at z= (790/91) -1 ≈ 8.7 → z≈7.7. That's a very high redshift.

Wait, but in that case, the comoving distance would be way larger than the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman alpha is about 121 nm. So if observed at 790, that's z≈(790/121) -1 ≈6.52. So z≈5.5 (earlier calculation). Then the comoving distance for z≈5.5 in this cosmology.

Hmm. I think at z=5.5, the comoving distance would be around 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that. The highest option is 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, let me double-check: if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), and observed at 790 nm, the redshift z is (790/121)-1 = 6.528 -1=5.528. So z=5.528.

Now, I need to compute D_c(z=5.528) in a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

I recall that the comoving distance for high redshifts can be approximated using the formula:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / sqrt(Omega_m (1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'

But since doing this integral by hand is tedious, perhaps I can use an approximate method or recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 7 Gpc, and for z=6, it's about 9 Gpc. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z much larger than 1, the E(z) is dominated by the matter term, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^(3/2). Thus,

1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^(3/2)) )

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^z dz' / E(z') ≈ (1/sqrt(Omega_m)) ∫₀^z dz'/(1+z')^(3/2)

The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is -2/(1+z') ) + C. Evaluated from 0 to z:

[-2/(1+z) + 2/(1+0)] = 2 [1 - 1/(1+z)]

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(Omega_m)) * 2 [1 - 1/(1+z) ]

Thus,

D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2 / sqrt(Omega_m)) [1 - 1/(1+z) ]

Plug in the numbers:

c = 3e5 km/s

H0 =70 km/s/Mpc

So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

sqrt(Omega_m) = sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477.

So,

D_c ≈ 4285.7 Mpc * (2 / 0.5477) [1 - 1/(1+5.528)]

Compute [1 - 1/(6.528)] ≈ 1 - 0.153 → 0.847.

So,

D_c ≈ 4285.7 * (2/0.5477) * 0.847

Compute 2/0.5477 ≈ 3.656.

So,

4285.7 * 3.656 ≈ Let's compute 4285 *3.656.

Well, 4000 *3.656=14,624.

285 *3.656 ≈ 1,039.

Total ≈ 14,624 + 1,039 = 15,663.

Multiply by 0.847: 15,663 *0.847 ≈ 13,297 Mpc.

That's about 13,300 Mpc or 13.3 Gpc.

Wait, but the options are up to 9 Gpc. So this approach must be wrong. Because the approximation I used is only valid for very high z, where matter dominates. Maybe at z=5.5, dark energy has a significant effect, so the approximation overestimates the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a proper integration method. Let me try to compute the integral numerically using a few steps.

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

We can approximate the integral ∫₀^5.5 dz' / E(z').

Let me split the integral into intervals where the function changes more gradually.

But without computational tools, it's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula from the book "An Introduction to Modern Cosmology" by Andrew H. J. Riess or similar.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the age of the universe and the comoving distance.

The age of the universe at redshift z is given by:

t(z) = (1/H0) ∫(z to ∞) dz' / ( (1+z') E(z') )

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can refer to a table of comoving distances for various redshifts. I recall that in a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distances for z=1, 2, 3, etc., are:

z=1 → ~2 Gpc

z=2 → ~4 Gpc

z=3 → ~6 Gpc

z=4 → ~8 Gpc

z=5 → ~9 Gpc

z=6 → ~10 Gpc

Wait, but I'm not sure about these figures. If that's the case, then for z=5.5, D_c would be around 9 Gpc. The options include 9 Gpc as option C.

Alternatively, if z=5, D_c is around 9 Gpc, then for z=5.5, perhaps it's about 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate approximation.

I found a formula for the comoving distance for a flat universe:

D_c = (c / H0) * [ (2 c)/(H0 a) ) * ∫(a to 1) da' / sqrt( a'^3 Omega_m + a'^4 Omega_lambda ) ]

Wait, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately 10 Gpc. But again, the options don't include that.

Wait, looking back at the options: A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

If z=5.5, and for a flat universe with these parameters, I think D_c is about 9 Gpc. So option C is 9 Gpc.

But let me think again. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm and the rest is 121 nm, z=5.5.

In a universe with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, and Omega_lambda=0.7.

Another approach: using the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda )

We can approximate this integral numerically. Let's compute it in parts.

Let me define E(z) as sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

We'll break the integral from 0 to 5.5 into intervals of Δz=1, and approximate each part with the midpoint value.

So the integral becomes sum over each interval of (Δz) * (1/E(z_i)), where z_i is the midpoint.

So let's compute each interval:

From z=0 to 1: midpoint z=0.5.

E(0.5) = sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(3.375) +0.7) = sqrt(1.0125 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=≈1.3086.

So 1/E(0.5)=0.765.

Δz=1, so contribution: 1 * 0.765 =0.765.

z=1 to 2: midpoint z=1.5.

E(1.5)=sqrt(0.3*(2.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*15.625 +0.7)= sqrt(4.6875 +0.7)=sqrt(5.3875)=~2.321.

1/E=0.4307.

Contribution: 1 * 0.4307=0.4307.

z=2 to3: midpoint z=2.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(3.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*42.875 +0.7)= sqrt(12.8625 +0.7)=sqrt(13.5625)=3.682.

1/E=0.2717.

Contribution: 0.2717.

z=3 to4: midpoint z=3.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(4.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*91.125 +0.7)= sqrt(27.3375 +0.7)=sqrt(28.0375)=5.294.

1/E=0.1889.

Contribution: 0.1889.

z=4 to5: midpoint z=4.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(5.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*166.375 +0.7)= sqrt(49.9125 +0.7)=sqrt(50.6125)=7.115.

1/E=0.1405.

Contribution: 0.1405.

z=5 to5.5: midpoint z=5.25.

E= sqrt(0.3*(6.25)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*244.14 +0.7)= sqrt(73.242 +0.7)=sqrt(73.942)=8.598.

1/E=0.1163.

Contribution: 0.1163.

Now, sum all contributions:

0.765 + 0.4307 = 1.1957

+0.2717 → 1.4674

+0.1889 → 1.6563

+0.1405 → 1.7968

+0.1163 → 1.9131.

So the integral is approximately 1.9131.

Now, multiply by (c/H0):

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0=3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

So D_c=4285.7 *1.9131 ≈ let's calculate:

4285.7 *1.9131 ≈ 4285.7 * 2 ≈8571.4, but minus 4285.7 * 0.0869.

0.0869 *4285≈ 373.

So 8571.4 -373 ≈ 8198 Mpc → 8.198 Gpc.

So approximately 8.2 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, and option C is 9 Gpc.

Hmm, 8.2 is closer to 8 Gpc. So the answer might be B)8 Gpc.

But wait, this is a rough approximation because I used only 5 intervals with Δz=1 and midpoints, which isn't very accurate. The actual integral would require more intervals for better precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc for z=5.5.

So the correct answer is B)8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, with flux dropping significantly at wavelengths shorter than this. This suggests the peak corresponds to a redshifted emission line. Assuming the rest wavelength of the emission line is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), the redshift is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.53
\]

With a redshift \( z \approx 5.53 \), the comoving distance \( D_c \) is computed using the formula:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')}
\]

where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} \), and the cosmological parameters are \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), and the universe is flat (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)).

### Key Steps:
1. **Integral Approximation**: The integral \( \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \) is approximated numerically by breaking it into intervals of \( \Delta z = 1 \) and evaluating \( E(z) \) at midpoints. This yields an approximate value for the integral.
2. **Comoving Distance Calculation**: Using \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the term \( c/H_0 \) is calculated as:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc}
\]

3. **Final Comoving Distance**: Multiplying \( c/H_0 \) by the approximated integral value gives the comoving distance. After performing the numerical integration, the result is approximately \( D_c \approx 8.2 \, \text{Gpc} \).

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance of the quasar is closest to 8 Gpc, corresponding to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to figure it out.

So the question says that observations of a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that quasars often have emission lines, and sometimes when we observe them, their spectrum can be broad because of their high velocities. But wait, the peak being at 790 nm - what does that signify? Oh right, the peak might be from a specific emission line, like the Lyman-alpha line or something else. Wait, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm, which is in the UV. But wait, if the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790, maybe it's a redward shift? Or perhaps it's a Lyman break? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, quasars have strong emission lines. If the peak is in the near-infrared, maybe the quasar is so far away that its UV emission has been redshifted into the infrared. The Lyman break is a feature where the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than about 90 nm because the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium absorbs that. But wait, if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, that would imply a significant redshift.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm. If the quasar's emission line is observed at 790 nm, that would mean it's been redshifted by a factor of z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 ≈ 6.528. So z is about 5.528. Wait, that's a high redshift, which suggests it's very far away.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Oh, right, the comoving distance is the distance between two points at the same time (co-moving with the expansion of the universe). The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters.

The given cosmological parameters are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m = 0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_k = 0). So with these parameters, we can compute the comoving distance for a redshift z.

I need to find the comoving distance D_c for z ≈ 5.5. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, no, E(z) is the expansion factor. Let me think: the integral is ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^3? No, wait, dark energy density doesn't scale with (1+z)^3. Because dark energy is a cosmological constant, its density stays the same. So Omega_lambda is constant, while Omega_m scales as (1+z)^3.

So E(z) = [Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda]^0.5. So the integral is from 0 to z of dz' / E(z').

So I need to calculate the integral of 1/E(z') dz' from z'=0 to z=5.5. Hmmm. I don't remember the exact integral off the top of my head, but I know that for high redshifts, the integral is dominated by the matter density. At high z, (1+z) is large, so Omega_m*(1+z)^3 becomes much larger than Omega_lambda. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3) = (1+z)^{3/2} * sqrt(Omega_m). So 1/E(z) ≈ (1+z)^{-3/2} / sqrt(Omega_m).

But to get the precise value, I think I'll need to use an approximation or a lookup table. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to use a known approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe with Omega_m and Omega_lambda.

I remember that for z << 1, the comoving distance can be approximated with D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1 + (1 - q0)/2 z), where q0 is the deceleration parameter. But q0 is related to the cosmological parameters. Wait, q0 = (Omega_m/2) - Omega_lambda. But with our parameters, Omega_m is 0.3 and Omega_lambda is 0.7, so q0 = (0.3/2) - 0.7 = 0.15 - 0.7 = -0.55. So for small z, that approximation would be useful, but z=5.5 is not small. So that approach won't work here.

Another approach is to use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe dominated by dark energy or matter. For high redshifts, when matter dominates (z >> 1), the comoving distance scales roughly as (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1+z)^{3/2} / sqrt(Omega_m). Let's plug in z=5.5:

(1+z) = 6.5 → (6.5)^(3/2) = sqrt(6.5^3) = sqrt(274.625) ≈ 16.568.

So D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * 16.568 / sqrt(0.3). Let's compute each part.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So (c/H0) = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by (2/3) → 4285.7 * (2/3) ≈ 2857 Mpc.

Then multiply by 16.568 → 2857 * 16.568 ≈ let's see, 2857 * 16 is 45,712, and 2857 * 0.568 is about 1,625. So total around 47,337 Mpc.

Then divide by sqrt(0.3). sqrt(0.3) is about 0.5477. So 47337 / 0.5477 ≈ roughly 86,300 Mpc.

Wait, but 86,300 Mpc is 86.3 gigaparsecs. But wait, that's way larger than the given options, which are up to 9 Gpc. So something's wrong with my approach. Maybe the high-z assumption isn't correct here? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me think again. The standard formula for comoving distance when matter dominates (z >> 1) is D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1+z)^(3/2) / sqrt(Omega_m). Did I get that right?

Wait, no, I think I might have confused the factors. Let me double-check the formula for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe. The comoving distance is (c/H0) * (2/(3 H0)) * (a_0/a)^(3/2) ) * [some factors], but perhaps I'm mixing terms.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps I should use a cosmology calculator or known look-up tables. But since I can't do that right now, maybe I can recall that for z=1, the comoving distance in this cosmology is about 2 Gpc (but I'm not sure). Wait, no, for z=1, the comoving distance is around 2 Gpc when H0 is 70. Wait, no, wait: for H0=70, 1/H0 is about 14 billion years. So 1/H0 in Mpc is roughly 14e9 yr * c (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) → 14e9 * 3e5 /70 → (14/70)*3e5 *1e9 yr → 0.2 *3e5 *1e9 → 6e13 Mpc·yr. But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula from some standard textbooks. I recall that for a flat universe with Omega_m and Omega_lambda, the comoving distance for a given redshift can be approximated using certain integrals. However, without computational tools, I might have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm suggests that the emission line is redshifted into the infrared. If the rest wavelength is, say, 121 nm (Lyman alpha), then the redshift z is (790/121) -1 ≈ 6.52 -1 = 5.52. So z≈5.5.

Now, I need to compute the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a universe with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

I remember that for such parameters, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. The comoving distance for z=5.5 would be roughly higher than the age of the universe times the speed of light, but wait, that's not correct because comoving distance is not the same as the light travel distance.

Wait, no. The comoving distance is related to the expansion during the light's journey. So for z=5.5, the comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), with E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Hmm, I think I can approximate the integral numerically. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Let me compute E(z) at various points between 0 and 5.5 to approximate the integral.

But without doing a detailed calculation, perhaps I can recall that for z=5.5, the comoving distance in a flat universe with these parameters is approximately 10 Gpc. But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because my earlier rough calculation gave around 86 Gpc, which is way higher than the options. That suggests I did a mistake in scaling.

Wait another thought: perhaps the peak is not from Lyman alpha but another line. Let's calculate the possible rest wavelength.

Suppose the observed peak is at 790 nm, and it's due to a certain emission line. Let's say it's the Lyman break, which is a drop in flux below about 90 nm in the rest frame. Wait, but if the peak is at 790, which is longer than 90, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series; maybe it's the Lyman-beta line at 102.6 nm. Then z = (790 / 102.6) -1 ≈ 7.7→ z≈6.67.

Hmm, but that would make it even higher.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from something else, like the Balmer series. The Balmer-alpha line is at 656 nm in the rest frame. So if observed at 790, z=(790/656) -1≈ 1.203. So z≈1.2. That's a much lower redshift. Then, the comoving distance would be different.

Wait, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths than 790. So if the rest frame is 656, observed at 790, then shorter wavelengths (in the observed frame) are bluer than 790, so that's 790 nm to shorter, which corresponds to higher wavelengths in the rest frame. Wait, but wait, H-alpha is at 656 nm. If the quasar emits H-alpha, and it's observed at 790, that's a redshift of (790/656)=1.204. So z≈1.2.

So that's a much more reasonable redshift, and the comoving distance for z=1.2 in this cosmology is about 2 Gpc. But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a near-infrared emission line, not optical.

Wait, another possibility: the peak is from the C IV emission line. Let me think, C IV is around 155 nm. So observed at 790, z=(790/155) -1 ≈ 4.77. So z≈4.77.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Mg II emission line, which is about 279 nm. Observed at 790, z=(790/279)-1≈2.8.

So in that case, z≈2.8. Then, the comoving distance for z≈3 is about 3 Gpc? Or wait, let me think.

Wait, I think I need a better approach. I should use a cosmology calculator or recall the formula for comoving distance.

The comoving distance D_c is given by:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z dz' / E(z')

with E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

But without the exact integral, maybe I can use an approximate formula or a known value.

I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is approximately 2 Gpc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for E(z) when z is not too high.

Alternatively, I can use the look-up table from the standard textbooks or online sources. But since I can't access that, I'll have to think.

Wait, I found that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is about 10 Gpc. But the options go up to 9 Gpc. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the redshift is lower.

Wait, the problem says that the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at wavelengths <790 nm. So perhaps the quasar's spectrum is dropping into the UV? Which is absorbed by the intergalactic medium beyond a certain wavelength (the Lyman break). So perhaps the quasar's own emission is in the UV, but beyond a certain wavelength, the flux drops due to the IGM's absorption. So the peak at 790 nm would be the Lyman limit (91 nm rest frame) redshifted.

Wait, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, that's the Lyman limit at z= (790/91) -1 ≈ 8.7 → z≈7.7. That's a very high redshift.

Wait, but in that case, the comoving distance would be way larger than the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman alpha is about 121 nm. So if observed at 790, that's z≈(790/121) -1 ≈6.52. So z≈5.5 (earlier calculation). Then the comoving distance for z≈5.5 in this cosmology.

Hmm. I think at z=5.5, the comoving distance would be around 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that. The highest option is 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, let me double-check: if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), and observed at 790 nm, the redshift z is (790/121)-1 = 6.528 -1=5.528. So z=5.528.

Now, I need to compute D_c(z=5.528) in a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

I recall that the comoving distance for high redshifts can be approximated using the formula:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / sqrt(Omega_m (1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'

But since doing this integral by hand is tedious, perhaps I can use an approximate method or recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 7 Gpc, and for z=6, it's about 9 Gpc. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z much larger than 1, the E(z) is dominated by the matter term, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^(3/2). Thus,

1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^(3/2)) )

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^z dz' / E(z') ≈ (1/sqrt(Omega_m)) ∫₀^z dz'/(1+z')^(3/2)

The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is -2/(1+z') ) + C. Evaluated from 0 to z:

[-2/(1+z) + 2/(1+0)] = 2 [1 - 1/(1+z)]

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(Omega_m)) * 2 [1 - 1/(1+z) ]

Thus,

D_c ≈ (c/H0) * (2 / sqrt(Omega_m)) [1 - 1/(1+z) ]

Plug in the numbers:

c = 3e5 km/s

H0 =70 km/s/Mpc

So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

sqrt(Omega_m) = sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477.

So,

D_c ≈ 4285.7 Mpc * (2 / 0.5477) [1 - 1/(1+5.528)]

Compute [1 - 1/(6.528)] ≈ 1 - 0.153 → 0.847.

So,

D_c ≈ 4285.7 * (2/0.5477) * 0.847

Compute 2/0.5477 ≈ 3.656.

So,

4285.7 * 3.656 ≈ Let's compute 4285 *3.656.

Well, 4000 *3.656=14,624.

285 *3.656 ≈ 1,039.

Total ≈ 14,624 + 1,039 = 15,663.

Multiply by 0.847: 15,663 *0.847 ≈ 13,297 Mpc.

That's about 13,300 Mpc or 13.3 Gpc.

Wait, but the options are up to 9 Gpc. So this approach must be wrong. Because the approximation I used is only valid for very high z, where matter dominates. Maybe at z=5.5, dark energy has a significant effect, so the approximation overestimates the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a proper integration method. Let me try to compute the integral numerically using a few steps.

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

We can approximate the integral ∫₀^5.5 dz' / E(z').

Let me split the integral into intervals where the function changes more gradually.

But without computational tools, it's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula from the book "An Introduction to Modern Cosmology" by Andrew H. J. Riess or similar.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the age of the universe and the comoving distance.

The age of the universe at redshift z is given by:

t(z) = (1/H0) ∫(z to ∞) dz' / ( (1+z') E(z') )

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can refer to a table of comoving distances for various redshifts. I recall that in a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distances for z=1, 2, 3, etc., are:

z=1 → ~2 Gpc

z=2 → ~4 Gpc

z=3 → ~6 Gpc

z=4 → ~8 Gpc

z=5 → ~9 Gpc

z=6 → ~10 Gpc

Wait, but I'm not sure about these figures. If that's the case, then for z=5.5, D_c would be around 9 Gpc. The options include 9 Gpc as option C.

Alternatively, if z=5, D_c is around 9 Gpc, then for z=5.5, perhaps it's about 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate approximation.

I found a formula for the comoving distance for a flat universe:

D_c = (c / H0) * [ (2 c)/(H0 a) ) * ∫(a to 1) da' / sqrt( a'^3 Omega_m + a'^4 Omega_lambda ) ]

Wait, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately 10 Gpc. But again, the options don't include that.

Wait, looking back at the options: A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

If z=5.5, and for a flat universe with these parameters, I think D_c is about 9 Gpc. So option C is 9 Gpc.

But let me think again. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm and the rest is 121 nm, z=5.5.

In a universe with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, and Omega_lambda=0.7.

Another approach: using the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda )

We can approximate this integral numerically. Let's compute it in parts.

Let me define E(z) as sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

We'll break the integral from 0 to 5.5 into intervals of Δz=1, and approximate each part with the midpoint value.

So the integral becomes sum over each interval of (Δz) * (1/E(z_i)), where z_i is the midpoint.

So let's compute each interval:

From z=0 to 1: midpoint z=0.5.

E(0.5) = sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(3.375) +0.7) = sqrt(1.0125 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=≈1.3086.

So 1/E(0.5)=0.765.

Δz=1, so contribution: 1 * 0.765 =0.765.

z=1 to 2: midpoint z=1.5.

E(1.5)=sqrt(0.3*(2.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*15.625 +0.7)= sqrt(4.6875 +0.7)=sqrt(5.3875)=~2.321.

1/E=0.4307.

Contribution: 1 * 0.4307=0.4307.

z=2 to3: midpoint z=2.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(3.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*42.875 +0.7)= sqrt(12.8625 +0.7)=sqrt(13.5625)=3.682.

1/E=0.2717.

Contribution: 0.2717.

z=3 to4: midpoint z=3.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(4.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*91.125 +0.7)= sqrt(27.3375 +0.7)=sqrt(28.0375)=5.294.

1/E=0.1889.

Contribution: 0.1889.

z=4 to5: midpoint z=4.5.

E= sqrt(0.3*(5.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*166.375 +0.7)= sqrt(49.9125 +0.7)=sqrt(50.6125)=7.115.

1/E=0.1405.

Contribution: 0.1405.

z=5 to5.5: midpoint z=5.25.

E= sqrt(0.3*(6.25)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*244.14 +0.7)= sqrt(73.242 +0.7)=sqrt(73.942)=8.598.

1/E=0.1163.

Contribution: 0.1163.

Now, sum all contributions:

0.765 + 0.4307 = 1.1957

+0.2717 → 1.4674

+0.1889 → 1.6563

+0.1405 → 1.7968

+0.1163 → 1.9131.

So the integral is approximately 1.9131.

Now, multiply by (c/H0):

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0=3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

So D_c=4285.7 *1.9131 ≈ let's calculate:

4285.7 *1.9131 ≈ 4285.7 * 2 ≈8571.4, but minus 4285.7 * 0.0869.

0.0869 *4285≈ 373.

So 8571.4 -373 ≈ 8198 Mpc → 8.198 Gpc.

So approximately 8.2 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, and option C is 9 Gpc.

Hmm, 8.2 is closer to 8 Gpc. So the answer might be B)8 Gpc.

But wait, this is a rough approximation because I used only 5 intervals with Δz=1 and midpoints, which isn't very accurate. The actual integral would require more intervals for better precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc for z=5.5.

So the correct answer is B)8 Gpc.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, with flux dropping significantly at wavelengths shorter than this. This suggests the peak corresponds to a redshifted emission line. Assuming the rest wavelength of the emission line is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), the redshift is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.53
\]

With a redshift \( z \approx 5.53 \), the comoving distance \( D_c \) is computed using the formula:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')}
\]

where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} \), and the cosmological parameters are \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), and the universe is flat (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)).

### Key Steps:
1. **Integral Approximation**: The integral \( \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \) is approximated numerically by breaking it into intervals of \( \Delta z = 1 \) and evaluating \( E(z) \) at midpoints. This yields an approximate value for the integral.
2. **Comoving Distance Calculation**: Using \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the term \( c/H_0 \) is calculated as:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc}
\]

3. **Final Comoving Distance**: Multiplying \( c/H_0 \) by the approximated integral value gives the comoving distance. After performing the numerical integration, the result is approximately \( D_c \approx 8.2 \, \text{Gpc} \).

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance of the quasar is closest to 8 Gpc, corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B
