Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles like electrons and positrons collide, they can annihilate each other and produce energy, often in the form of photons. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photon directions.

First, I think I should consider conservation laws here—conservation of energy and momentum. Since the electron and positron are annihilating into two photons, the total energy and momentum before collision must equal the total after.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is given for each. Lorentz factor gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², right? So gamma being 4 means the electron's total energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV. Similarly, the positron has a gamma of 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So I need to consider their momenta as vectors. Let me set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction.

So, the electron's momentum is gamma * m_e * c * beta in the +x direction. Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma * m_e * c * beta in the -x direction. Because they have opposite directions but same magnitude of velocity (since they're moving along the same axis towards each other), but different gammas.

Wait, no. Wait, beta is v/c. Each particle has their own beta. Oh wait, no, because Lorentz factors are different, their velocities are different. So I think I need to calculate their velocities.

But maybe I don't need their velocities directly. Let me think. The total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

So, total energy before collision is E_electron + E_positron.

E_electron = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.

E_positron = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

So total energy is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.

Total momentum is the sum of the two momenta. But since they're moving in opposite directions, the positron's momentum is negative compared to the electron's.

Momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But v is beta c. So p = gamma m_e beta c.

So let's compute beta for each particle. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

For the electron (gamma=4):

beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

So p_e = 4 * m_e c * (0.9682) ≈ 4 * m_e c * 0.9682.

Wait, no. Wait, p = gamma m_e v. v = beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

So for electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Wait, let me compute beta_e more accurately. sqrt(15) is about 3.87298. Divided by 4 is approximately 0.9682.

So p_e = 4 * m_e c * (0.9682) ≈ 3.87298 m_e c.

Similarly for the positron (gamma=2):

beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c = 2 * m_e c * (0.8660) ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -1.732 m_e c.

So total momentum is p_e + p_p = 3.87298 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.87298 -1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14098 m_e c.

Wait, but wait, momentum is a vector. So the positron's momentum is negative, so the total is p = (gamma_e m_e beta_e - gamma_p m_e beta_p) c.

Wait, let me get that right. Because the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative, so p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So the total momentum is p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e beta_e - gamma_p m_e beta_p) c.

Wait, no, wait. The electron is moving to the right (positive x), positron to the left (negative x). So their momenta in the same direction? Or opposite?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. If the electron is moving from left to right (positive x), its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So p_p is negative.

So the total momentum is p_e - p_p, since p_p is in the opposite direction.

Wait, no. Let's get this right.

In standard terms, let's say the electron is moving along +x, so its momentum is +p_e.

The positron is moving along -x, so its momentum is -p_p.

So total momentum is p_e - p_p.

But wait, p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum. So the total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, but the momentum of the positron is in the opposite direction, so it's subtracting that.

So, p_total = p_e - p_p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each momentum as a vector: p_e is +gamma_e m_e beta_e c, p_p is -gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So total momentum is (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.

So, substituting the numbers:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So (4 * 0.9682) - (2 * 0.8660) = 3.8728 -1.732 =2.1408.

So p_total ≈ 2.1408 m_e c.

But wait, m_e c is the unit of momentum. Let me just denote m_e c as units, so p_total is 2.1408 units.

So before annihilation, the system has energy 3.066 MeV and momentum 2.1408 m_e c.

After annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem says they have the same value. So E1 = E2.

And the directions are upper-right and lower-right, which implies they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, but what about the angle?

Wait, the problem states: one photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right direction. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, but maybe not exactly symmetric? Or maybe they are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the two photons must carry away the total energy and momentum. Since both photons have the same energy, that implies their momenta have the same magnitude because for photons, E = |p| c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude p1 = E/(c) and p2 = E/(c). But their directions are different.

But since the total momentum of the system after annihilation must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c in the +x direction.

So the sum of the two photon momenta must be equal to this.

Let me represent the photons' momenta as vectors.

Let me denote the first photon's momentum as p1, making an angle theta above the x-axis, and the second as p2, making an angle phi below the x-axis. But the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so their angles are in opposite vertical directions. But I'm not sure if they are symmetric or not.

Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy, so their momenta have the same magnitude. So |p1| = |p2| = E_photon / c.

Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors. So the first photon has components (p_x, p_y), and the second has (p'_x, p'_y). The sum of these must equal the initial momentum vector.

Because the photons' energies are same, their magnitudes are same. So |p1| = |p2|.

But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their y-components have opposite signs. Let's say photon 1 has y-component positive, and photon 2 has y-component negative.

So, equations:

p1_x + p2_x = total initial momentum along x: 2.1408 m_e c.

p1_y + p2_y = 0, because in the initial state, the momentum is along x, so any y-components must cancel out.

But since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are same. So:

|p1| = |p2| = E_ph / c.

Since E_photon is the same for both, and E_ph = |p_ph| c.

So, each photon's momentum has magnitude E_ph/c. Let me denote E_ph as E.

So, for photon 1: p1_x = E/c * cos(theta), p1_y = E/c * sin(theta).

For photon 2: p2_x = E/c * cos(phi), p2_y = -E/c * sin(phi).

Wait, but why is it -sin(phi)? Because it's moving in the lower-right direction, so the angle is measured below the x-axis, so sin would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps phi is the magnitude, and the y-component is negative.

So, summing the y-components: [E/c sin(theta)] - [E/c sin(phi)] = 0.

So E/c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) )=0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

Which implies that either theta = phi or theta = pi - phi.

But theta and phi are both angles in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. So if sin(theta) = sin(phi), the possibilities are theta = phi (but that would make both photons in same direction, but with same energy and same angle, which would not result in the sum of momenta adding up to the initial, which has only x-component), or theta = pi - phi.

Wait, if theta = pi - phi, then sin(theta) = sin(pi - phi) = sin(phi), which would satisfy the equation. Let's consider that case.

So, let me assume theta + phi = pi, meaning that they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So if theta is the angle above x-axis for photon 1, then photon 2 is at angle theta below x-axis. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but let's check what the problem says: one is upper-right, one is lower-right. So their angles from x-axis are theta and -theta, perhaps. So let's model that.

Thus, let me set the angles as theta and -theta.

So:

p1_y = E/c sin(theta)
p2_y = E/c sin(-theta) = - E/c sin(theta)

Summing p1_y + p2_y = 0, which is correct.

X-components:

p1_x = E/c cos(theta)
p2_x = E/c cos(-theta) = E/c cos(theta)

Summing p1_x + p2_x = 2 E cos(theta) / c.

This must equal the initial total momentum: 2.1408 m_e c.

So:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

But wait, E is the energy of each photon, which is the same.

Also, the total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of the two photons, which is 2E.

But the initial total energy is 3.066 MeV, which must equal 2E.

So 2E = 3.066 MeV → E = 1.533 MeV.

So E = 1.533 MeV.

So, substituting into the momentum equation: 2 (1.533 MeV / c) cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, wait. Let me be careful with units.

E is in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c, so E/(c) is (MeV/c²) * c = MeV/(c) → which is momentum.

Wait, but let me think in terms of units.

E_ph = 1.533 MeV.

So, p_ph = E_ph / c = (1.533 MeV) / c → which is momentum.

So, 2 * p_ph * cos(theta) = p_total.

p_total is 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, but m_e c is a unit of momentum. So 2.1408 m_e c is the total initial momentum.

So, 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, wait, this can't be right because units don't match. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial momentum is 2.1408 m_e c. The momentum of each photon is E_ph / c = 1.533 MeV / c.

So, let's compute 2 * (1.533 MeV/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

But m_e c is approximately 0.511 MeV/c² * c = 0.511 MeV/c.

Wait, because m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c.

So, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c = approximately 1.10 MeV/c.

So, left side: 2 * 1.533 MeV/c * cos(theta) = 3.066 MeV/c * cos(theta).

Right side: 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 1.10 MeV/c.

So, set 3.066 cos(theta) = 1.10.

So, cos(theta) = 1.10 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3585.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3585) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, that gives theta around 69 degrees. So each photon is at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2*69 = 138 degrees.

Wait a second, but let me compute it accurately.

Compute 1.10 / 3.066: 1.1 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3585.

Arccos(0.3585) is approximately 69 degrees, yes.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 times theta, so 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation of an electron and a positron into two photons, focusing on conservation of energy and momentum.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy and directions in the upper-right and lower-right.

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4(0.511 \, \text{MeV}) + 2(0.511 \, \text{MeV}) = 3.066 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - Since the photons have equal energy, the energy of each photon is:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{3.066 \, \text{MeV}}{2} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum before annihilation is the vector sum of the electron and positron momenta:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c - \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c,
     \]
     where \(\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\). Substituting the values:
     \[
     \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \approx 0.9682, \quad \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = 4(0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c)(0.9682) - 2(0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c)(0.8660) \approx 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has energy \(E_{\text{photon}} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}\), and its momentum magnitude is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{1.533 \, \text{MeV}}{c}.
     \]
   - Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The x-components of the photons' momenta are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{2x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta.
     \]
     The total momentum in the x-direction is:
     \[
     p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]
     Substituting \(p_{\text{photon}} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}/c\):
     \[
     2(1.533 \, \text{MeV}/c) \cos\theta = 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{2(1.533)} \approx 0.3585.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3585) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
     \[
     2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles like electrons and positrons collide, they can annihilate each other and produce energy, often in the form of photons. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photon directions.

First, I think I should consider conservation laws here—conservation of energy and momentum. Since the electron and positron are annihilating into two photons, the total energy and momentum before collision must equal the total after.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is given for each. Lorentz factor gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², right? So gamma being 4 means the electron's total energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV. Similarly, the positron has a gamma of 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So I need to consider their momenta as vectors. Let me set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction.

So, the electron's momentum is gamma * m_e * c * beta in the +x direction. Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma * m_e * c * beta in the -x direction. Because they have opposite directions but same magnitude of velocity (since they're moving along the same axis towards each other), but different gammas.

Wait, no. Wait, beta is v/c. Each particle has their own beta. Oh wait, no, because Lorentz factors are different, their velocities are different. So I think I need to calculate their velocities.

But maybe I don't need their velocities directly. Let me think. The total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

So, total energy before collision is E_electron + E_positron.

E_electron = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.

E_positron = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

So total energy is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.

Total momentum is the sum of the two momenta. But since they're moving in opposite directions, the positron's momentum is negative compared to the electron's.

Momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But v is beta c. So p = gamma m_e beta c.

So let's compute beta for each particle. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

For the electron (gamma=4):

beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

So p_e = 4 * m_e c * (0.9682) ≈ 4 * m_e c * 0.9682.

Wait, no. Wait, p = gamma m_e v. v = beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

So for electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Wait, let me compute beta_e more accurately. sqrt(15) is about 3.87298. Divided by 4 is approximately 0.9682.

So p_e = 4 * m_e c * (0.9682) ≈ 3.87298 m_e c.

Similarly for the positron (gamma=2):

beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c = 2 * m_e c * (0.8660) ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -1.732 m_e c.

So total momentum is p_e + p_p = 3.87298 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.87298 -1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14098 m_e c.

Wait, but wait, momentum is a vector. So the positron's momentum is negative, so the total is p = (gamma_e m_e beta_e - gamma_p m_e beta_p) c.

Wait, let me get that right. Because the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative, so p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So the total momentum is p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e beta_e - gamma_p m_e beta_p) c.

Wait, no, wait. The electron is moving to the right (positive x), positron to the left (negative x). So their momenta in the same direction? Or opposite?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. If the electron is moving from left to right (positive x), its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So p_p is negative.

So the total momentum is p_e - p_p, since p_p is in the opposite direction.

Wait, no. Let's get this right.

In standard terms, let's say the electron is moving along +x, so its momentum is +p_e.

The positron is moving along -x, so its momentum is -p_p.

So total momentum is p_e - p_p.

But wait, p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum. So the total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, but the momentum of the positron is in the opposite direction, so it's subtracting that.

So, p_total = p_e - p_p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each momentum as a vector: p_e is +gamma_e m_e beta_e c, p_p is -gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So total momentum is (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.

So, substituting the numbers:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So (4 * 0.9682) - (2 * 0.8660) = 3.8728 -1.732 =2.1408.

So p_total ≈ 2.1408 m_e c.

But wait, m_e c is the unit of momentum. Let me just denote m_e c as units, so p_total is 2.1408 units.

So before annihilation, the system has energy 3.066 MeV and momentum 2.1408 m_e c.

After annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem says they have the same value. So E1 = E2.

And the directions are upper-right and lower-right, which implies they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, but what about the angle?

Wait, the problem states: one photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right direction. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, but maybe not exactly symmetric? Or maybe they are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the two photons must carry away the total energy and momentum. Since both photons have the same energy, that implies their momenta have the same magnitude because for photons, E = |p| c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude p1 = E/(c) and p2 = E/(c). But their directions are different.

But since the total momentum of the system after annihilation must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c in the +x direction.

So the sum of the two photon momenta must be equal to this.

Let me represent the photons' momenta as vectors.

Let me denote the first photon's momentum as p1, making an angle theta above the x-axis, and the second as p2, making an angle phi below the x-axis. But the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so their angles are in opposite vertical directions. But I'm not sure if they are symmetric or not.

Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy, so their momenta have the same magnitude. So |p1| = |p2| = E_photon / c.

Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors. So the first photon has components (p_x, p_y), and the second has (p'_x, p'_y). The sum of these must equal the initial momentum vector.

Because the photons' energies are same, their magnitudes are same. So |p1| = |p2|.

But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their y-components have opposite signs. Let's say photon 1 has y-component positive, and photon 2 has y-component negative.

So, equations:

p1_x + p2_x = total initial momentum along x: 2.1408 m_e c.

p1_y + p2_y = 0, because in the initial state, the momentum is along x, so any y-components must cancel out.

But since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are same. So:

|p1| = |p2| = E_ph / c.

Since E_photon is the same for both, and E_ph = |p_ph| c.

So, each photon's momentum has magnitude E_ph/c. Let me denote E_ph as E.

So, for photon 1: p1_x = E/c * cos(theta), p1_y = E/c * sin(theta).

For photon 2: p2_x = E/c * cos(phi), p2_y = -E/c * sin(phi).

Wait, but why is it -sin(phi)? Because it's moving in the lower-right direction, so the angle is measured below the x-axis, so sin would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps phi is the magnitude, and the y-component is negative.

So, summing the y-components: [E/c sin(theta)] - [E/c sin(phi)] = 0.

So E/c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) )=0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

Which implies that either theta = phi or theta = pi - phi.

But theta and phi are both angles in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. So if sin(theta) = sin(phi), the possibilities are theta = phi (but that would make both photons in same direction, but with same energy and same angle, which would not result in the sum of momenta adding up to the initial, which has only x-component), or theta = pi - phi.

Wait, if theta = pi - phi, then sin(theta) = sin(pi - phi) = sin(phi), which would satisfy the equation. Let's consider that case.

So, let me assume theta + phi = pi, meaning that they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So if theta is the angle above x-axis for photon 1, then photon 2 is at angle theta below x-axis. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but let's check what the problem says: one is upper-right, one is lower-right. So their angles from x-axis are theta and -theta, perhaps. So let's model that.

Thus, let me set the angles as theta and -theta.

So:

p1_y = E/c sin(theta)
p2_y = E/c sin(-theta) = - E/c sin(theta)

Summing p1_y + p2_y = 0, which is correct.

X-components:

p1_x = E/c cos(theta)
p2_x = E/c cos(-theta) = E/c cos(theta)

Summing p1_x + p2_x = 2 E cos(theta) / c.

This must equal the initial total momentum: 2.1408 m_e c.

So:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

But wait, E is the energy of each photon, which is the same.

Also, the total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of the two photons, which is 2E.

But the initial total energy is 3.066 MeV, which must equal 2E.

So 2E = 3.066 MeV → E = 1.533 MeV.

So E = 1.533 MeV.

So, substituting into the momentum equation: 2 (1.533 MeV / c) cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, wait. Let me be careful with units.

E is in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c, so E/(c) is (MeV/c²) * c = MeV/(c) → which is momentum.

Wait, but let me think in terms of units.

E_ph = 1.533 MeV.

So, p_ph = E_ph / c = (1.533 MeV) / c → which is momentum.

So, 2 * p_ph * cos(theta) = p_total.

p_total is 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, but m_e c is a unit of momentum. So 2.1408 m_e c is the total initial momentum.

So, 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, wait, this can't be right because units don't match. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial momentum is 2.1408 m_e c. The momentum of each photon is E_ph / c = 1.533 MeV / c.

So, let's compute 2 * (1.533 MeV/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

But m_e c is approximately 0.511 MeV/c² * c = 0.511 MeV/c.

Wait, because m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c.

So, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c = approximately 1.10 MeV/c.

So, left side: 2 * 1.533 MeV/c * cos(theta) = 3.066 MeV/c * cos(theta).

Right side: 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 1.10 MeV/c.

So, set 3.066 cos(theta) = 1.10.

So, cos(theta) = 1.10 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3585.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3585) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, that gives theta around 69 degrees. So each photon is at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2*69 = 138 degrees.

Wait a second, but let me compute it accurately.

Compute 1.10 / 3.066: 1.1 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3585.

Arccos(0.3585) is approximately 69 degrees, yes.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 times theta, so 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation of an electron and a positron into two photons, focusing on conservation of energy and momentum.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy and directions in the upper-right and lower-right.

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4(0.511 \, \text{MeV}) + 2(0.511 \, \text{MeV}) = 3.066 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - Since the photons have equal energy, the energy of each photon is:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{3.066 \, \text{MeV}}{2} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum before annihilation is the vector sum of the electron and positron momenta:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c - \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c,
     \]
     where \(\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\). Substituting the values:
     \[
     \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \approx 0.9682, \quad \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = 4(0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c)(0.9682) - 2(0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c)(0.8660) \approx 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has energy \(E_{\text{photon}} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}\), and its momentum magnitude is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{1.533 \, \text{MeV}}{c}.
     \]
   - Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The x-components of the photons' momenta are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{2x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta.
     \]
     The total momentum in the x-direction is:
     \[
     p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]
     Substituting \(p_{\text{photon}} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}/c\):
     \[
     2(1.533 \, \text{MeV}/c) \cos\theta = 2.1408 \, \text{MeV}/c.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{2(1.533)} \approx 0.3585.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3585) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
     \[
     2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
