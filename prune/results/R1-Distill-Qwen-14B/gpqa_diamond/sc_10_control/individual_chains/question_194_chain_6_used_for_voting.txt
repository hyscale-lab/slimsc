Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them have the same energy, so we can group them. Let me think about all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But before that, let me think about the energy expression. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. Let me denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J S.

Hmm, so the energy depends on S. Let me figure out all possible values of S. Each of S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1, since each S is ±1.

Wait, no. Let's think: S1S2 is (+1)(+1)=1, (+1)(-1)=-1, etc. So for each pair, the product is either +1 or -1. So S is the sum of three such terms. The possible values of S could range from -3 to +3, but let's see what's actually possible.

Wait, no. Let me think: S is the sum of three terms each ±1. So the maximum sum is 3 (all +1), minimum is -3 (all -1). But are all these values possible?

Wait, but let's compute for each possible state of the spins.

Let me list all possible spin configurations and their S and E.

Each spin is S1, S2, S3. So 8 possibilities.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2 = 1*1=1
   S1S3=1
   S2S3=1
   S = 1+1+1=3
   E = -J*(3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1
   S = 1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1
   S= -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = J

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1
   S= -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = J

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1
   S= -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = J

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1
   S= -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = J

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1
   S=1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = J

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1
   S=1+1+1=3
   E = -J*(3) = -3J

Wait, so looking at these 8 states, let's group them by their energies.

Energy E = -3J occurs for two states: all spins up or all down.

Energy E = J occurs for the other six states.

So in terms of the partition function, each state contributes e^(-βE). So all the two states with E=-3J contribute e^(3Jβ) each. And the six states with E=J contribute e^(-Jβ) each.

So Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^{Jβ}

Wait, that would be if E was positive 3J and -J. But our E is -3J and +J, so the exponents would be 3Jβ and -Jβ.

So for each state with E=-3J, the term is e^{β*(-E)} = e^{β*3J}.

Similarly for E=J, the term is e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options, that's option A. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^{-3 J β} +6 e^{J β} → No, because that would be if E was +3J and -J. No, our E is -3J and +J.

Wait, no. Wait, in the partition function, each state's contribution is e^{-β E}.

So for the states with E=-3J, the exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3Jβ. So e^{3Jβ}.

For the states with E=J, exponent is -β*(J) → e^{-Jβ}.

So Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → Doesn't match.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I have.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me make sure.

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what we calculated.

So the answer is B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By enumerating all states, we compute the energy \( E \) for each configuration and group states with the same energy.

### Energy Analysis
1. **All spins aligned** (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \)):
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = -3J.
   \]
   There are 2 such states.

2. **Mixed spins** (all other configurations):
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = J.
   \]
   There are 6 such states.

### Partition Function
Each state contributes \( e^{-\beta E} \) to \( Z \):
- For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( e^{3J\beta} \).
- For the 6 states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer
The correct partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them have the same energy, so we can group them. Let me think about all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But before that, let me think about the energy expression. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. Let me denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J S.

Hmm, so the energy depends on S. Let me figure out all possible values of S. Each of S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1, since each S is ±1.

Wait, no. Let's think: S1S2 is (+1)(+1)=1, (+1)(-1)=-1, etc. So for each pair, the product is either +1 or -1. So S is the sum of three such terms. The possible values of S could range from -3 to +3, but let's see what's actually possible.

Wait, no. Let me think: S is the sum of three terms each ±1. So the maximum sum is 3 (all +1), minimum is -3 (all -1). But are all these values possible?

Wait, but let's compute for each possible state of the spins.

Let me list all possible spin configurations and their S and E.

Each spin is S1, S2, S3. So 8 possibilities.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2 = 1*1=1
   S1S3=1
   S2S3=1
   S = 1+1+1=3
   E = -J*(3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1
   S = 1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1
   S= -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = J

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1
   S= -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = J

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1
   S= -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = J

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1
   S= -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = J

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1
   S=1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = J

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1
   S=1+1+1=3
   E = -J*(3) = -3J

Wait, so looking at these 8 states, let's group them by their energies.

Energy E = -3J occurs for two states: all spins up or all down.

Energy E = J occurs for the other six states.

So in terms of the partition function, each state contributes e^(-βE). So all the two states with E=-3J contribute e^(3Jβ) each. And the six states with E=J contribute e^(-Jβ) each.

So Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^{Jβ}

Wait, that would be if E was positive 3J and -J. But our E is -3J and +J, so the exponents would be 3Jβ and -Jβ.

So for each state with E=-3J, the term is e^{β*(-E)} = e^{β*3J}.

Similarly for E=J, the term is e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options, that's option A. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^{-3 J β} +6 e^{J β} → No, because that would be if E was +3J and -J. No, our E is -3J and +J.

Wait, no. Wait, in the partition function, each state's contribution is e^{-β E}.

So for the states with E=-3J, the exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3Jβ. So e^{3Jβ}.

For the states with E=J, exponent is -β*(J) → e^{-Jβ}.

So Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → Doesn't match.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I have.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me make sure.

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what we calculated.

So the answer is B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By enumerating all states, we compute the energy \( E \) for each configuration and group states with the same energy.

### Energy Analysis
1. **All spins aligned** (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \)):
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = -3J.
   \]
   There are 2 such states.

2. **Mixed spins** (all other configurations):
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = J.
   \]
   There are 6 such states.

### Partition Function
Each state contributes \( e^{-\beta E} \) to \( Z \):
- For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( e^{3J\beta} \).
- For the 6 states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer
The correct partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Answer: B
