Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what the problem says.

So, first, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that luminosity is related to radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity L is proportional to R squared multiplied by T to the fourth power, so L = 4πσR²T⁴. Oh yeah, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so if T1 = T2, then the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) times (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that ratio becomes (R1²)/(R2²). R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So Star_1's luminosity is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options have some around 2.23 and 2.32, etc. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something because the problem also mentions radial velocities.

Wait, what do radial velocities have to do with luminosity? Hmm. Oh, maybe because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths. The observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength if the star is moving. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe they're referring to the observed wavelengths, which would mean the Doppler effect has to be considered.

Wait, this might complicate things. Because the actual temperature of the stars could be different if their light is Doppler shifted. Because the star moving towards us (with a positive radial velocity) would have its light blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be different from the actual λ_max emitted by the star.

So let me think. Suppose Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away because the radial velocity is positive (if positive means moving away). So for Star_2, the observed wavelength λ2_obs is longer than its emitted wavelength λ2_em. But in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, so the actual emitted λ for each star would be different. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelengths are longer when observed, so to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1 (which is not moving), Star_2's emitted λ would have to be shorter. Wait, no, wait: if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its emitted λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So Star_1's emitted λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's emitted λ_max is λ2.

Wait, but the Doppler shift formula is (λ_observed) = (λ_emitted) * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away). Wait, no, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt[(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)] for relativistic speeds, but for non-relativistic, it's approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but 700 km/s is about 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So v/c is about 0.00233, so the non-relativistic approximation should be okay. So for Star_2, which has v = 700 km/s, moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

So, given that, the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1, since its v is 0. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). And the problem states that λ1 = λ2_obs. So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v2 / c).

But wait, from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2. So since T1 = T2? No, wait no, because the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1 = λ2_obs.

So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v2/c). But λ1 = b/(T1), λ2 =b/(T2). So putting it together, (b/T1) = (b/T2) (1 + v2/c). So the T's are different. So T1 is not equal to T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed λ_max are the same, T1 = T2. But that's only if the stars are at rest. But since Star_2 is moving, the observed λ_max depends on both the intrinsic temperature and the Doppler shift. So my initial assumption was incorrect. So now I need to find the actual temperatures of the stars.

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both have the same observed λ_max. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, since v1 is zero, λ1_obs = λ1_emitted. And for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emitted * (1 + v2/c). So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2. So substituting:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

The b's cancel out. So 1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). Wait, because 1/(T1) = [1/(T2)] (1 + v/c), so T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + v2/c)].

Alternatively, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). Since Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive. So T1 is less than T2? Wait, that can't be right because Star_1 is larger in radius and mass. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's plug in numbers.

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So T2 is approximately 0.997667 * T1? No, wait, wait:

Wait, T1 = T2 / (1.0023333) → T2 = T1 * 1.0023333.

So T2 is higher than T1 by ~0.23%.

But wait, that's a very small difference. So maybe it's acceptable to approximate T1 ≈ T2, but in this problem, perhaps we can't ignore it because the answer depends on the exact value.

Hmm, but let's not approximate yet. Let's proceed.

The luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πσR²T⁴.

So we can write the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = 2.25 R2².

So L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * (T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) → 2.25 (T1^4 / T2^4).

But from earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T2 = 1.0023333 T1.

So T2^4 = (1.0023333)^4 T1^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.0023333)^4.

Compute (1.0023333)^4:

First, compute ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈x for small x).

So 4 * ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.009317.

Then exp(0.009317) ≈ 1.00936.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So 1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.9907.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23, which matches this result.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without considering velocities, it would have been 2.25, but with the velocity, it's a bit less.

So the answer must be option D, 2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check the math, perhaps I made an approximation error.

Wait, let's compute (1.0023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.0023333^2 first.

1.0023333 * 1.0023333: 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2. So about 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444 → approx 1.004672044.

Then square that: (1.004672044)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*0.004672044 + (0.004672044)^2.

Calculating:

2 * 0.004672044 = 0.009344088.

(0.004672044)^2 ≈ (0.004672)^2 ≈ 0.000021827.

So total is 1 + 0.009344088 + 0.000021827 ≈ 1.009365915.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659.

So 1/(1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228, which is about 2.23.

So the correct option is D.

To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius Ratio**: Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)). Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperatures of the stars are affected by their radial velocities due to the Doppler effect.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,1}} \)). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is redshifted:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c),
   \]
   where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). This gives:
   \[
   1 + v_2/c = 1 + 700/300,000 \approx 1.002333.
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the emitted wavelengths:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{em,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
   \]
   Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)^{-1}.
   \]
   Substituting \( 1 + v_2/c \approx 1.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997667.
   \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**: The fourth power of the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.997667)^4.
   \]
   Approximating \( (1 - 0.002333)^4 \) using the binomial expansion:
   \[
   (1 - 0.002333)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 0.9907.
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = 2.25 \) and \( T_1^4 / T_2^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228.
   \]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what the problem says.

Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so if T1 = T2, then the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) times (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that ratio becomes (R1²)/(R2²). R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So Star_1's luminosity is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options have some around 2.23 and 2.32, etc. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something because the problem also mentions radial velocities.

Wait, what do radial velocities have to do with luminosity? Hmm. Oh, maybe because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths. The observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength if the star is moving. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe they're referring to the observed wavelengths, which would mean the Doppler effect has to be considered.

Wait, this might complicate things. Because the actual temperature of the stars could be different if their light is Doppler shifted. Because the star moving towards us (with a positive radial velocity) would have its light blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be different from the actual λ_max emitted by the star.

So let me think. Suppose Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away because the radial velocity is positive (if positive means moving away). So for Star_2, the observed wavelength λ2_obs is longer than its emitted wavelength λ2_em. But in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, so the actual emitted λ for each star would be different. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelengths are longer when observed, so to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1 (which is not moving), Star_2's emitted λ would have to be shorter. Wait, no, wait: if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its emitted λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So Star_1's emitted λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's emitted λ_max is λ2.

Wait, but the Doppler shift formula is (λ_observed) = (λ_emitted) * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away). Wait, no, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt[(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)] for relativistic speeds, but for non-relativistic, it's approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but 700 km/s is about 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So v/c is about 0.00233, so the non-relativistic approximation should be okay. So for Star_2, which has v = 700 km/s, moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

So, given that, the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1, since its v is 0. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). And the problem states that λ1 = λ2_obs. So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v2 / c).

But wait, from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2. So since T1 = T2? No, wait no, because the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1 = λ2_obs.

So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v2/c). But λ1 = b/(T1), λ2 =b/(T2). So putting it together, (b/T1) = (b/T2) (1 + v2/c). So the T's are different. So T1 is not equal to T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed λ_max are the same, T1 = T2. But that's only if the stars are at rest. But since Star_2 is moving, the observed λ_max depends on both the intrinsic temperature and the Doppler shift. So my initial assumption was incorrect. So now I need to find the actual temperatures of the stars.

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both have the same observed λ_max. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, since v1 is zero, λ1_obs = λ1_emitted. And for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emitted * (1 + v2/c). So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2. So substituting:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

The b's cancel out. So 1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). Wait, because 1/(T1) = [1/(T2)] (1 + v/c), so T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + v2/c)].

Alternatively, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). Since Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive. So T1 is less than T2? Wait, that can't be right because Star_1 is larger in radius and mass. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's plug in numbers.

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So T2 is approximately 0.997667 * T1? No, wait, wait:

Wait, T1 = T2 / (1.0023333) → T2 = T1 * 1.0023333.

So T2 is higher than T1 by ~0.23%.

But wait, that's a very small difference. So maybe it's acceptable to approximate T1 ≈ T2, but in this problem, perhaps we can't ignore it because the answer depends on the exact value.

Hmm, but let's not approximate yet. Let's proceed.

The luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πσR²T⁴.

So we can write the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = 2.25 R2².

So L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * (T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) → 2.25 (T1^4 / T2^4).

But from earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T2 = 1.0023333 T1.

So T2^4 = (1.0023333)^4 T1^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.0023333)^4.

Compute (1.0023333)^4:

First, compute ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈x for small x).

So 4 * ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.009317.

Then exp(0.009317) ≈ 1.00936.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So 1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.9907.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23, which matches this result.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without considering velocities, it would have been 2.25, but with the velocity, it's a bit less.

So the answer must be option D, 2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check the math, perhaps I made an approximation error.

Wait, let's compute (1.0023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.0023333^2 first.

1.0023333 * 1.0023333: 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2. So about 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444 → approx 1.004672044.

Then square that: (1.004672044)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*0.004672044 + (0.004672044)^2.

Calculating:

2 * 0.004672044 = 0.009344088.

(0.004672044)^2 ≈ (0.004672)^2 ≈ 0.000021827.

So total is 1 + 0.009344088 + 0.000021827 ≈ 1.009365915.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659.

So 1/(1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228, which is about 2.23.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius Ratio**: Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)). Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperatures of the stars are affected by their radial velocities due to the Doppler effect.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,1}} \)). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is redshifted:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c),
   \]
   where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). This gives:
   \[
   1 + v_2/c = 1 + 700/300,000 \approx 1.002333.
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the emitted wavelengths:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{em,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
   \]
   Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)^{-1}.
   \]
   Substituting \( 1 + v_2/c \approx 1.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997667.
   \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**: The fourth power of the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.997667)^4.
   \]
   Approximating \( (1 - 0.002333)^4 \) using the binomial expansion:
   \[
   (1 - 0.002333)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 0.9907.
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = 2.25 \) and \( T_1^4 / T_2^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228.
   \]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
