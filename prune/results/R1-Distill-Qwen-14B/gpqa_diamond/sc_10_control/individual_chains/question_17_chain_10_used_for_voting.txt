Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Alright, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So, calcium-EDTA complex must be something like Ca-EDTA.

The problem says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Stochiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, I think. So, each mole of Ca-EDTA contains one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the free calcium ions concentration, not the complex. Because in solution, some of the EDTA might dissociate, right? So I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions when the complex is present.

The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, formation constant (Kf) represents the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So since K is really large, almost all the Ca²+ would be bound by EDTA, leaving a very small concentration of free Ca²+.

I think the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Let me check that. Yes, that's right. So, because initially, we have 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that initially, there's no free Ca²+ or EDTA, but that's probably not the case. Wait, no. Wait, the solution is formed by the dissociation of the complex. Wait, wait. Let's think carefully.

When the Ca-EDTA complex is dissolved in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that. But wait, in reality, EDTA is usually in a different form depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says to assume the pH is ideal, so I guess the EDTA is in its correct form to form the complex. So the pH is such that EDTA is in the correct deprotonated form to bind Ca²+.

So, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let’s let s be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. Wait, no, actually, the complex is in solution, and it's in equilibrium with the ions. So, the initial concentration would dissociate a little bit, but since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

Let me set up the equilibrium. Let’s say the concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, each unit releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, the equilibrium expression is:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, because the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and when it dissociates, the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] will both increase by some small amount x. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. But wait, that's not correct. Because if the complex is dissociating, the [Ca-EDTA] would decrease by x, but wait, that's only if we started with pure complex. Or perhaps I should think of it as the complex is present, and the initial concentration is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to let the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA be 0.02 M, and upon dissociation, [Ca²+] = s, [EDTA^4-] = s, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole of each ion.

So, the expression becomes:

Kf = (0.02 - s) / (s * s) ≈ (0.02) / s². Because s is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02.

So, solving for s:

s² = 0.02 / Kf.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so s² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-13 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, wait. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

s² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-6 * 1e-7; the square root is 1e-6.5.

So, 2 * 1e-6.5 is 2e-6.5. Let me compute that. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So, s is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that would make [Ca²+] equal to s, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. So s squared is 0.02 / 5e10. Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is indeed about 6.32e-7.

Yes, so the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( s \). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Thus, \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = s \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = s \), and \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] \approx 0.02 \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( s^2 \):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

So, solving for s:

s² = 0.02 / Kf.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so s² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-13 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, wait. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

s² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-6 * 1e-7; the square root is 1e-6.5.

So, 2 * 1e-6.5 is 2e-6.5. Let me compute that. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So, s is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. So s squared is 0.02 / 5e10. Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is indeed about 6.32e-7.
