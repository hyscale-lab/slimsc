Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four possible pairs, each with different tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what kind of structures these compounds have. The molecular formula C10H14 suggests that each compound is a substituted benzene ring. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: each benzene ring has 4 degrees (3 double bonds equivalent because of the ring plus the double bonds). So 10 carbons, 14 hydrogens. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees, which fits with one benzene ring and maybe some substituents.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would add more carbons. Let me check the molecular formulas.

Wait, the question says the mixture is of two compounds, each with C10H14. So each compound must have 10 carbons. Let me check each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's C8H10 because benzene (6 carbons) plus 4 methyl groups (each adds 1 C, 3 H). Wait, no, wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is C1H3. Four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So total is 6+4=10 C, and 6 H (from benzene) +12 H from methyl =18 H. Wait, but the formula is C10H14. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, so maybe I miscalculated. Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to the benzene. So the formula would be C6H5(CH3)4? Wait, C6H5 has five H? No wait, benzene is C6H6. When you add substituents, each substitution replaces an H. So four methyl groups would replace four H. So the formula would be C6H6 - 4 H + 4*(CH3) = C10H10? Because each CH3 adds 3 H. Let me compute: C6 +4 C= C10. H: 6 -4 (since 4 substituents) + 4*3 = 6-4=2 +12=14 H. Oh, okay, so each tetramethylbenzene would be C10H14. So option A's two compounds are both C10H14, which matches the question. Similarly, option D has two tetramethylbenzenes, so correct formula. Option B has two tetramethylbenzenes, correct formula. Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is also C10H14. But the other option in C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Each ethyl has 2 carbons, so two ethyl groups add 4 C. Benzene is 6, so 6 +4=10 C. But each ethyl is CH2CH3. So each ethyl group has 5 H: CH2CH3 is 2+3=5 H. So two ethyl groups would add 10 H. Benzene has 6 H, but each substitution replaces an H. So two substituents: 6 - 2 =4 H. Plus 10 from ethyls: total H is 14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C8H10? Wait no: wait, benzene is C6H6; each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups: C4H10. So the molecule is C6+4=10 C. H: 6 -2 (substituted H) + 10 (ethyls) = 14 H. So yes, C10H14. So option C's compounds are correct.

So all the options have two compounds with C10H14.

Now, looking at the NMR data.

The aromatic region: two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet integrates to 2 protons (since 1:1 and total two signals). Wait, but wait, the integral is a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet is integrating to the same number of protons. The mixture is 1:1, so each compound contributes equally. So perhaps each compound has the same number of equivalent aromatic protons. Alternatively, each compound has a certain number of equivalent protons, and their signals are averaging.

Wait, but the aromatic region shows two signals, each a singlet. So each aromatic protons in each compound are equivalent. Or perhaps each compound has a certain pattern, but in the mixture, their signals are separate and in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait, the question says the NMR is of a 1:1 mixture. So each compound contributes equally. The aromatic signals are at 6.7 ppm, two singlets, 1:1 ratio. So each singlet corresponds to a set of aromatic protons from one compound. So each compound has one set of aromatic protons, which is a singlet. So each compound must have all equivalent aromatic protons, which would mean that each aromatic ring is symmetric enough that all the remaining protons are equivalent.

Wait, benzene with substituents. In a tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are four methyl groups. Depending on their positions, the remaining protons on the ring could be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the substituents make the aromatic protons into equivalent sets, leading to a singlet.

Let me think about each structure:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6. Are those two positions equivalent? Let's imagine the ring. Positions 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. 4 is between 3 and 5. 5 is next to 4 and 6. 6 is next to 5 and 1. Wait, but with substituents at 1,2,3,4—so positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ring has symmetry. The substituents are at 1,2,3,4. The ring would have a certain symmetry. Let me visualize: positions 1,2,3,4 are substituted with methyl groups. Positions 5 and 6 are H. So how are these Hs arranged? Are they in equivalent positions?

Wait, if I rotate the ring 180 degrees, position 5 would swap with position 1, but that's a substituent. Hmm, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So perhaps the two Hs in positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. So their NMR would be a singlet.

Alternatively, maybe it's para positions, but no, in 1,2,3,4 substitution, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4, then the ring would look something like this:

Positions: 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (H), 6 (H).

Now, considering the symmetry, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane along the 1-4 axis. If so, then the H in position 5 would be equivalent to the H in position 6. So their NMR would be a singlet.

So in this case, the aromatic region would show a singlet integrating for 2 H. So when the compound is in the mixture, it would contribute a singlet at 6.7 ppm. So that's one compound.

The other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let's see the positions:

Positions 1,2,3,5 are methyl. So the H's are at 4 and 6.

Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me think about the structure's symmetry. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then positions 4 and 6 are across from each other. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric about a certain axis. Let me imagine: substituents at 1,2,3,5. If you consider the ring, maybe the molecule is symmetric across the axis that goes through position 4 and position 6, but no, position 5 is methyl. Wait, maybe it's a mirror plane. Hmm, perhaps the H at position 4 and 6 are not equivalent.

Wait, perhaps if you look at the substituents, substituents are at 1,2,3,5: so positions 4 and 6 are each adjacent to substituents. But are they in equivalent environments?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5 (both methyl), and position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So positions 4 and 6 each have two methyl neighbors. But wait, position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So the environments are the same. So the two Hs (positions 4 and 6) would be equivalent, and their NMR would be a singlet.

So each of the two compounds in option A would have a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, each integrating to 2 H. So in the NMR, each would give a singlet, and because it's a 1:1 mixture, the peaks would be in a 1:1 ratio. That matches the data given.

So that's the aromatic part. Now, the other signals are at 2.2 ppm, three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These are likely from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings.

Each compound has four methyl groups attached to the benzene. But depending on their positions, some methyl groups might be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. For each compound, how many different types of methyl groups are present?

Option A's first compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let's see: considering the symmetry, perhaps positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. Wait, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let me think about the dihedral angles. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some methyl groups equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are in a square arrangement around the ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent. So the molecule is like 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted benzene. Now, in this structure, are any of the methyl groups equivalent? Let's see: methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Methyl at position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Methyl at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Methyl at 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Wait, but substituents are at 1,2,3,4, so the positions 5 and 6 are H. So in this structure, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Because the ring is symmetric across a plane that passes through positions 1 and 4 and the opposite side.

So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be equivalent, giving a singlet, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be equivalent, giving another singlet. But wait, how many methyl groups are there? Four, so if 1 and 4 are equivalent, that's two methyls, and 2 and 3 are equivalent, that's another two. So in the NMR, two sets of methyl groups. So their signals would be two singlets, each integrating for two methyl groups (but wait, each group is two CH3, so each would integrate to 6 H? Or wait, each methyl group is three H. So two equivalent methyl groups would give a peak integrating for 6 H. Wait, but in the NMR data, we have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound contributes a certain number of methyl groups, but when mixed, their signals add up.

Wait, but the question says that there are three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the sum of all methyl groups from both compounds must have three different types, with their respective integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let's think about each compound's methyl groups and how they contribute to the NMR.

First, for the first compound in option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

As discussed, it has two sets of equivalent methyl groups: let's say group A (positions 1 and 4) and group B (positions 2 and 3). Each group has two methyls. So in the NMR, this would give two signals: group A integrating for 6 H (two CH3) and group B integrating for another 6 H. So two signals from this compound.

The other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its substituents. Positions 1,2,3,5 are methyl. So the H's are at 4 and 6, which we thought are equivalent. Now, the methyl groups: groups at 1,2,3,5.

Are any of these equivalent? Let's see. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the ring is substituted at four positions, but not all adjacent. Positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, and 5 is across from 4. So perhaps the symmetry is different here.

In this case, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, because they are symmetric across a certain axis. Let's see: position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4. Wait, but substituent at 5 is methyl. So the structure might be less symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1,2,3,5 cause the methyl groups to split into different environments.

Wait, perhaps the methyl at position 5 is in a different environment compared to the others. Let me think: the other methyl groups are at 1,2,3. So the methyl at 5 is across from position 4 (which is H in this case) and next to 4 and 6. Wait, but 4 is H in this compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and the methyl at 2 and 5 are also equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's see: if the plane is along the 4-5 axis, then position 1 would mirror to position 3, and position 2 would mirror to itself. Wait, position 2 is in the middle. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C2 axis. If the molecule is rotated 180 degrees, perhaps positions 1 and 3 would swap, and 2 would stay the same, but position 5 would swap with position 5. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1,2,3,5 make each methyl group unique. That would give four distinct methyl groups, but that can't be, because in the NMR data, there are only three signals. So perhaps the methyl groups in this compound are split into two or three sets.

Wait, perhaps in this structure, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So that would be two sets of two methyl groups each. So the NMR would show two signals from this compound.

But wait, in that case, each compound would contribute two signals (the first compound has two, the second has two). So the total would be four signals. But in the data, there are three signals. So perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about each possible option and analyze their NMR signals.

The question mentions that the three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total integration is 2 +1 +1 =4. Each integral corresponds to the number of H in each group. Wait, each methyl group is 3 H. So let's think in terms of groups.

If the three signals are in 2:1:1 ratio, that could mean:

- The first signal integrates for 6 H (2 groups of CH3)
- Second: 3 H (1 group)
- Third: 3 H (1 group)

So in total, 6 +3 +3=12 H from CH3 groups. Since each compound has four CH3 groups, that's 4 *2 =8 CH3 groups, but wait, no: each compound is tetramethyl (four CH3), so two compounds would have 8 CH3 groups. But 8 CH3 groups would be 8 *3=24 H. But in the NMR, the integral is 12 H. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the integral is for the sum of all protons in the three signals, which is 2:1:1. The total is 4 parts. So 2 parts would be 6 H, 1 part is 3 H, another part is 3 H. So 6 +3 +3 =12 H. So 12 H from CH3 groups.

But each CH3 is 3 H, so 12 H would correspond to 4 CH3 groups. So in the mixture, the sum of all CH3 groups is 4. But wait, each compound is a tetramethyl (4 CH3), so two compounds would have 8 CH3. How does this reconcile?

Ah, wait, no: the integral in the NMR is for the mixture. So the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. So each contributes their own CH3 groups. So if each compound has four CH3, the mixture would have 4 +4 =8 CH3 groups. But the NMR shows 12 H in the three signals. 8 CH3 groups would be 24 H, but the data says 12 H. That can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the 2:1:1 ratio is not the integral of H, but the area. So for each signal, the ratio is 2:1:1, meaning one signal is twice as high as the others. So perhaps the CH3 groups are in proportions 2:1:1.

Wait, but each CH3 is a singlet, which implies that each set is a unique environment and none are split by neighboring Hs.

So perhaps for each compound, the CH3 groups split into multiple signals, and when mixed, the total is three signals.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at each option and see what their CH3 groups would look like.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me see: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

So positions 3 and 6 are H. Are the H's at 3 and 6 equivalent? Let's see. The substituents at 1 and 2 are adjacent, then 4 and 5 are adjacent. So structure-wise, perhaps this molecule has a symmetry that makes the H's at 3 and 6 equivalent.

As for the methyl groups: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent?

Looking at substituents 1 and 4: are they in equivalent positions? If you rotate the ring 180 degrees, substituent 1 would move to position 4, and substituent 2 would move to position 5. So perhaps substituents 1 and 4 are equivalent, and substituents 2 and 5 are also equivalent. So in this case, the methyl groups would be in two sets: two methyl groups are equivalent at 1 and 4, and another two at 2 and 5.

So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups would split into two signals: each set of two CH3. So in the NMR, one singlet integrating for 6 H (two methyl groups) and another integrating for 6 H (the other two methyl groups).

Wait, but that's two signals. So when mixed with another compound, perhaps the other compound has three types of CH3 groups.

Wait, the other compound in option B is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Earlier, I thought that this compound has two sets of CH3 groups: two in positions 1 and 4 (equivalent) and two in positions 2 and 3 (equivalent). So when mixed, the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would contribute two signals (each 6 H), and the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would contribute two signals (each 6 H). But the NMR shows three signals, so perhaps this is not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total CH3 groups from both compounds. If each gives two signals, that would be four signals, but the NMR shows three. So option B can't be the answer, perhaps.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, diethyl is CH2CH3, so 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Let me think about its structure.

In this case, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the ethyl groups are para to each other. Now, the CH2 groups in the ethyl would be attached to the ring, each with their own sets.

In this structure, the ethyl groups are at 1 and 4. Each ethyl group would have two sets of protons: the CH2 next to the ring and the CH3 at the end.

But wait, the question states that the three signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets. So no splitting. So, for the ethyl groups, the CH2 and CH3 would be in different environments.

Wait, each ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The CH2 attached to the ring would be in a different environment than the CH3. So each ethyl would give two signals: the CH2 and the CH3. But since there are two ethyl groups, perhaps the CH2 and CH3 from each ethyl are equivalent.

So in 1,4-diethylbenzene, each ethyl group would have two types of H: the CH2 and CH3. So in the NMR, for each ethyl group, we would see two signals. So for two ethyl groups, perhaps we have two sets of CH2 and two sets of CH3. But wait, if the ethyl groups are in para positions, maybe their CH2 and CH3 groups are equivalent. So the CH2's would be a singlet, and the CH3's would be another singlet.

Wait, but let me think about it. For 1,4-diethylbenzene, each ethyl is attached to the ring. So the CH2's on each ethyl are in the same environment as the other CH2, and the CH3's are also in the same environment. So there would be two signals: one for all CH2 protons, and another for all CH3 protons.

But wait, the ethyl group is -CH2-CH3. The CH2 is attached to the ring. So each CH2 would have two H's, and each CH3 has three H's. But if the two ethyl groups are identical, their CH2 and CH3 would be equivalent, leading to two singlets: one for all CH2 (4 H, since two ethyl groups each contribute 2 H), and one for all CH3 (6 H, since two ethyl groups each contribute 3 H).

Wait, but the NMR data shows three signals at 2.2 ppm. So if the diethylbenzene contributes two signals (CH2 and CH3), and the tetramethylbenzene contributes one or two signals, the total could be three.

Let's take the tetramethylbenzene in option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its CH3 groups.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5.

So the CH3 groups are at positions 1,2,3,5. Are any of these CH3 groups equivalent?

As before, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent? Let me see: substituent 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H), substituent 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). Hmm, maybe 1 and 5 are in similar environments.

Alternatively, considering the substituents, perhaps positions 1 and 3 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 5 are equivalent. No, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, which are H's. So perhaps it's symmetric.

Alternatively, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry that makes some CH3 groups equivalent.

Wait, maybe the tetramethylbenzene in option C (1,2,3,5) has three equivalent CH3 groups and one different. That would lead to two signals: three CH3 in one environment and one in another.

Wait, but how? Let's imagine substituents at 1,2,3,5. The CH3 at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H). CH3 at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. CH3 at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4 (H). CH3 at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). So perhaps the CH3 at 5 is in a different environment than the others. So in this case, the CH3 groups at 1,2,3 would be in one environment, and the CH3 at 5 would be another. So in the NMR, two signals: one for three CH3 groups (each contributes 3 H, so 9 H) and another for one CH3 (3 H).

Wait, no: each CH3 is a group of three H. If three groups are equivalent, they would contribute 3 *3=9 H. The fourth is 3 H. So two signals: 9 H and 3 H. So when mixed with 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contributes two signals (CH2 and CH3), the total signals would be:

From tetramethyl: two signals (9 H and 3 H)
From diethyl: two signals (4 H and 6 H)
But wait, the question says three signals. So perhaps some of these signals combine.

Wait, the diethylbenzene would have CH2 (4 H) and CH3 (6 H) as two signals. The tetramethyl would have two signals. But in the NMR, there are three signals. So perhaps one of the signals from the tetramethyl and the diethyl coincide, making it a single peak.

But the diethyl's CH2 is probably around δ 1.5-2.0, but the CH3 would be around δ 0.9-1.3. Wait, but the data says all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. So maybe I'm wrong about the diethyl's CH2 and CH3 regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the chemical shifts.

Methyl groups attached to benzene rings are typically around δ 2.3-2.5 ppm. Ethyl groups' CH3 are generally around δ 1.2 ppm, and the CH2 attached to the ring might be around δ 2.2 ppm.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in ethylbenzene, the CH2 next to the benzene is usually around δ 1.2 (the CH2CH3 group's CH2 is split into a quartet around 1.2 ppm, but maybe if it's para diethyl, the coupling is different. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of diethylbenzene, the CH2 groups are more deshielded, so their shift is higher, around 2.2 ppm.

So if the diethylbenzene contributes a CH2 signal at 2.2 ppm (4 H) and a CH3 signal at a lower ppm (say, 1.2 ppm), but the data says all three signals are around 2.2. So perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, option C might not explain the NMR data because two of the signals would be elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider. Let's look at another option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First, the first compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

As before, substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 have H. Are the CH3 groups in this compound equivalent?

Looking at substituents: positions 1 and 4 are across from each other (if it's a para arrangement), and positions 2 and 5 are across as well. So substituents 1 and 4 are para, and substituents 2 and5 are para. So the molecule has a certain symmetry.

In this structure, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, this would give two signals: each integrating to 6 H (two CH3 groups).

The other compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Earlier analysis suggested that in this structure, the CH3 groups at 1,2,3 are equivalent in one environment, and the CH3 at 5 is in a different environment. So two signals: 9 H (from three CH3) and 3 H (from one CH3).

So when mixed, the first compound (1,2,4,5) contributes two signals (6 H each), and the second (1,2,3,5) contributes two signals (9 H and 3 H).

Wait, but in the NMR, there are three signals. So perhaps one of the signals overlaps or is split into another. Alternatively, maybe the CH3 groups in the first compound (1,2,4,5) are in such a way that when mixed with the second, the signals combine.

Wait, the NMR shows three signals: 2:1:1 ratio. So the total H from CH3 is 2+1+1 =4 parts. But each part corresponds to the integral. If the three signals are from the CH3 groups, each would be a certain number of H.

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two sets of CH3: set A (6 H) and set B (6 H). The second compound (1,2,3,5) has set C (9 H) and set D (3 H). But when mixed, the signals would combine if any are overlapping.

Wait, is there any chance that in the two compounds, some CH3 groups are equivalent? For example, if in both compounds, there's a CH3 group in a certain position, their signals would overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the two compounds in option D have some CH3 groups that are in similar environments, leading to overlapping signals. Let me think.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are at positions 1 and 4 (equivalent) and 2 and5 (equivalent).

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are at 1,2,3 (equivalent) and 5 (different).

So in the first compound, the CH3 at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and in the second compound, CH3 at 1,2,3 are equivalent. Are these groups in the same environment? Or are they different?

Wait, the environment of a CH3 depends on the substituents around it. For example, in the first compound, the CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (H), but in the second compound, the CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (H). Wait, but in the second compound, substituent at 3 is also a CH3. So the environments are different.

Hmm, perhaps not. Therefore, the CH3 groups from the two compounds might be in different environments, leading to separate signals.

So for the first compound (1,2,4,5): two signals (6 H each).

Second compound (1,2,3,5): two signals (9 H, 3 H).

Thus, in the mixture, we would have four signals, but the data shows three. So this can't be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are overlapping? No, because 9 H is one signal, 6 H is another.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the chemical shifts. Maybe in the two compounds, some CH3 groups are in the same environment and thus have the same chemical shift, leading to their signals merging.

For example, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 at position 1 is in a certain environment. In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 at 1 is in a different environment. So their shifts would be different, leading to separate signals.

But perhaps in some cases, like the CH3 at position 2 in both compounds, their environments are similar. Wait, in the first compound, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (CH3) and 3 (H). In the second compound, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (CH3) and 3 (CH3). So different environments, so different shifts.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's go back to the data.

The three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So possible integrals could be 6 H, 3 H, 3 H (if considering 2 parts to 1 part to 1 part). Or, if each is a different number, perhaps 4 H, 2 H, 2 H.

Wait, but each CH3 is 3 H. So the only way to get integrals in 2:1:1 is to have either two CH3 groups (6 H), and two single CH3 (3 H each), but that would sum to 6+3+3=12. Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the number of groups, not H. So two groups, each contributing 3 H, and one group contributing 3 H. But that would be 3 groups, 3 H each, which is 9 H. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the ratio refers to the area, not the number of H. So the areas are in 2:1:1. For example, one signal is twice as high as the others. So perhaps one signal has 6 H, and the other two have 3 H each (6:3:3 = 2:1:1).

So the three signals are 6 H, 3 H, and 3 H. So in total, 12 H.

Since each compound contributes four CH3 groups (each CH3 is 3 H), two compounds would contribute 8 CH3 (24 H). But wait, the three signals sum to 12 H. That doesn't add up. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio refers to the number of groups, not H. So two groups contribute twice as much as the others. For example, two groups each with 3 H (total 6 H) and two groups with 3 H each (total 6 H). But that would not explain a 2:1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, the three signals could be for two different types of methyl groups, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to think again about each option.

Option D: compounds 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound:

Methyl groups at 1,2,4,5.

Symmetry: likely two sets (positions 1 &4; 2&5), each giving a singlet. So two signals: each 6 H.

Second compound: methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.

Symmetry: perhaps the CH3 at 1,2,3 are equivalent (so 9 H) and CH3 at 5 is different (3 H), so two signals.

When mixed, the first contributes two signals (6 H each), second contributes two signals (9 H and 3 H).

Total signals: four. But the NMR shows three.

Hmm, so this can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the two CH3 groups from the first compound (each 6 H) and the CH3 groups from the second (9 H and 3 H) combine in such a way that one of the signals overlaps.

Wait, but unless the chemical shifts are the same, which is unlikely unless the environments are identical.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some symmetry in the compounds.

Let me think about the first compound in option D again: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, the molecule is symmetrical along a certain axis. So perhaps the CH3 groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the CH3 groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent.

Thus, in this case, the CH3 groups would be in two sets: each set has two CH3, so each gives a signal of 6 H.

The second compound in option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The CH3 groups at 1,2,3 are in one set, and 5 is another.

So the CH3 groups would be in two sets: three CH3 (9 H) and one CH3 (3 H).

When these two compounds are mixed, the signals from the first compound (6 H and 6 H) and the second (9 H and 3 H) would add up to four signals. But the data shows three, so perhaps this is not the correct option.

Wait, perhaps the diethylbenzene in option C could contribute three signals, but earlier analysis suggested it would contribute two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene's CH3 groups split into two signals, and the tetramethylbenzene's CH3 groups into two, but one of them coincides. Let's see.

In option C:

First compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. CH3 groups: 9 H and 3 H.

Second compound: 1,4-diethylbenzene. CH3 groups: 6 H (two CH3) and CH2 groups: 4 H.

But the CH2's chemical shift might be around 2.2 ppm. So in this case, the three signals would be:

- 9 H (from tetramethyl)
- 6 H (from diethyl's CH3)
- 4 H (from diethyl's CH2)
and another 3 H (from tetramethyl's other CH3), but wait, that's four signals. But the data shows three.

Hmm, perhaps the diethyl's CH2 and one of the tetramethyl's CH3 have the same shift, causing them to merge into one signal. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 and the tetramethyl's 3 H CH3 have the same shift, leading to a combined signal. But that's not very likely unless their environments are identical.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

The aromatic signals are two singlets at 6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio. So each compound has one set of equivalent aromatic H, integrating to 2 H each.

The other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio. So 6 H, 3 H, 3 H.

Looking for a pair of compounds where one has two types of CH3 (each contributing 6 H), and the other has CH3 groups that sum to 6 H and 3 H. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: for each option, check how many distinct CH3 groups each compound has, then see if when mixed, the total would be three signals.

Option A: two compounds, each has two types of CH3.

First compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Two types of CH3 (each 6 H). So when mixed, each contributes 6 H, but in a 1:1 ratio, so each would be a singlet with 6 H. But in the data, the three signals are 2:1:1, which is 6, 3, 3.

So perhaps the other compound has three CH3 groups, but that's not possible because it's a tetramethyl.

Wait, no: the other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has two types of CH3 (9 H and 3 H).

When mixed, their CH3 signals would be:

From first compound: two signals (each 6 H).
From second compound: two signals (9 H and 3 H).

But the data shows three signals. So perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are separate, making four signals total. Doesn't fit.

Option B: two compounds, each with two types of CH3.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two signals (each 6 H).

Second compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two signals (each 6 H).

When mixed, four signals. Not matching.

Option C: first compound (tetramethyl) has two CH3 signals (9 H and 3 H), second compound (diethyl) has two signals (4 H and 6 H). So four signals. Doesn't match.

Option D: first compound (1,2,4,5) has two signals (6 H each). Second compound (1,2,3,5) has two signals (9 H and 3 H). Total four signals. Not matching.

Wait, but the data shows three signals. So perhaps one of the compounds in one of the options has three types of CH3 groups, and the other has one. Let me see.

Wait, let's consider 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Are there three types of CH3 groups? No, because substituents are at 1,2,3,4. The CH3 groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and 2 and 3 are equivalent. So only two types.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has three types of CH3 groups. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, perhaps the CH3 at 1 is in a different environment than those at 2 and 3, and the CH3 at 5 is another. So three types: 1, 2/3, and 5. So three signals.

In that case, the signals would be:

- CH3 at 1: 3 H.
- CH3 at 2 and 3: 6 H.
- CH3 at 5: 3 H.

So when mixed with another compound that has two types of CH3 (each 6 H), the total would be five signals. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the correct answer. The correct answer is likely option D or option B.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are two singlets. So each compound must have a single set of equivalent aromatic H.

In option D, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, so one singlet (2 H). For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H at 4 and 6 would be equivalent, so another singlet (2 H). Thus, the aromatic region would show two singlets, each integrating to 2 H. Which matches the data.

Now, the methyl groups:

First compound (1,2,4,5): two types of CH3 (each 6 H).

Second compound (1,2,3,5): two types of CH3 (9 H and 3 H).

Thus, when mixed, the four CH3 would give four signals. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps one of the signals overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene (in option C) would have a different contribution. Wait, no, option C is a different pair.

Wait, perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are merged into a single peak, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 is at the same shift as one of the other signals.

I'm going to have to make a best guess here. The aromatic region fits option D because each compound has a single set of equivalent H. Now, for the CH3 signals: if the first compound contributes two signals (6 H each), and the second contributes one signal (9 H) and another (3 H), but perhaps the 9 H and 6 H from the first compound combine, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the first compound's CH3 groups are in two sets (6 H each), and the second's are in two sets (9 and 3). So when mixed, the first's two signals are 6 H each, but the second's are 9 H and 3 H. So the total signals are four. But the NMR shows three, so option D can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: in the NMR, the three CH3 signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one of the compounds contributes a single CH3 signal (6 H), and the other contributes two signals (3 H and 3 H). But each compound is a tetramethyl, which has four CH3. So how?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one of the compounds has two equivalent CH3 groups (6 H), and the other has three equivalent CH3 groups. But that's impossible because they have four CH3 each.

Wait, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 would be 6 H (two CH3), and the tetramethyl's CH3 would split into two signals (6 H and 6 H), but that would make three signals: 6,6,6. No, the ratio would be 1:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 is 6 H, and the tetramethyl's CH3 groups are 6 H and 6 H, but that's not matching the 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the CH3 signals. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The correct answer is likely option D, because each compound in D has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, giving two singlets in the aromatic region. For the methyl groups, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two types of CH3 (each 6 H), and the second (1,2,3,5) has CH3 groups that, when mixed, combine into a single peak. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the three signals' integrals are 6 H, 3 H, 3 H. So one signal from the first compound (6 H), and two from the second (3 H each). So for the first compound, perhaps it contributes a single 6 H signal, implying that all four CH3 groups are equivalent. But that's impossible because in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are in two sets.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds contributes a 6 H signal and the other contributes two 3 H signals.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The aromatic region fits option D, and perhaps the CH3 signals also fit. So I'll go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture, both with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄**, based on their **¹H NMR** data. The aromatic region shows **two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio**, and the aliphatic region shows **three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio**. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Region**:
   - The two singlets at 6.7 ppm indicate that each compound has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, integrating to 2 H each. This suggests that the compounds have high symmetry, making the remaining aromatic protons equivalent.

2. **Aliphatic Region**:
   - The three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio correspond to methyl groups. The total integration suggests one signal for 6 H (two methyl groups) and two signals for 3 H each (one methyl group each). This implies that the compounds have methyl groups in distinct environments.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/3 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region (two from each compound), which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option B**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/5 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/3 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **Conclusion**: This option also produces four signals in the aliphatic region, which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option C**: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **1,4-diethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1 and 4 leave positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The ethyl groups contribute two signals in the aliphatic region: one for the CH₂ groups (4 H) and one for the CH₃ groups (6 H).
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region (two from each compound), which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option D**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/5 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region, which does not match the observed three signals.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, **Option D** is the most consistent with the aromatic region data, as each compound has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons. However, the aliphatic region data (three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio) does not perfectly match any option. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the best answer.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four possible pairs, each with different tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what kind of structures these compounds have. The molecular formula C10H14 suggests that each compound is a substituted benzene ring. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: each benzene ring has 4 degrees (3 double bonds equivalent because of the ring plus the double bonds). So 10 carbons, 14 hydrogens. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees, which fits with one benzene ring and maybe some substituents.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would add more carbons. Let me check the molecular formulas.

Wait, the question says the mixture is of two compounds, each with C10H14. So each compound must have 10 carbons. Let me check each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's C8H10 because benzene (6 carbons) plus 4 methyl groups (each adds 1 C, 3 H). Wait, no, wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is C1H3. Four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So total is 6+4=10 C, and 6 H (from benzene) +12 H from methyl =18 H. Wait, but the formula is C10H14. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, so maybe I miscalculated. Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to the benzene. So the formula would be C6H5(CH3)4? Wait, C6H5 has five H? No wait, benzene is C6H6. When you add substituents, each substitution replaces an H. So four methyl groups would replace four H. So the formula would be C6H6 - 4 H + 4*(CH3) = C10H10? Because each CH3 adds 3 H. Let me compute: C6 +4 C= C10. H: 6 -4 (since 4 substituents) + 4*3 = 6-4=2 +12=14 H. Oh, okay, so each tetramethylbenzene would be C10H14. So option A's two compounds are both C10H14, which matches the question. Similarly, option D has two tetramethylbenzenes, so correct formula. Option B has two tetramethylbenzenes, correct formula. Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is also C10H14. But the other option in C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Each ethyl has 2 carbons, so two ethyl groups add 4 C. Benzene is 6, so 6 +4=10 C. But each ethyl is CH2CH3. So each ethyl group has 5 H: CH2CH3 is 2+3=5 H. So two ethyl groups would add 10 H. Benzene has 6 H, but each substitution replaces an H. So two substituents: 6 - 2 =4 H. Plus 10 from ethyls: total H is 14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C8H10? Wait no: wait, benzene is C6H6; each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups: C4H10. So the molecule is C6+4=10 C. H: 6 -2 (substituted H) + 10 (ethyls) = 14 H. So yes, C10H14. So option C's compounds are correct.

So all the options have two compounds with C10H14.

Now, looking at the NMR data.

The aromatic region: two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet integrates to 2 protons (since 1:1 and total two signals). Wait, but wait, the integral is a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet is integrating to the same number of protons. The mixture is 1:1, so each compound contributes equally. So perhaps each compound has the same number of equivalent aromatic protons. Alternatively, each compound has a certain number of equivalent protons, and their signals are averaging.

Wait, but the aromatic region shows two signals, each a singlet. So each aromatic protons in each compound are equivalent. Or perhaps each compound has a certain pattern, but in the mixture, their signals are separate and in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait, the question says the NMR is of a 1:1 mixture. So each compound contributes equally. The aromatic signals are at 6.7 ppm, two singlets, 1:1 ratio. So each singlet corresponds to a set of aromatic protons from one compound. So each compound has one set of aromatic protons, which is a singlet. So each compound must have all equivalent aromatic protons, which would mean that each aromatic ring is symmetric enough that all the remaining protons are equivalent.

Wait, benzene with substituents. In a tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are four methyl groups. Depending on their positions, the remaining protons on the ring could be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the substituents make the aromatic protons into equivalent sets, leading to a singlet.

Let me think about each structure:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6. Are those two positions equivalent? Let's imagine the ring. Positions 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. 4 is between 3 and 5. 5 is next to 4 and 6. 6 is next to 5 and 1. Wait, but with substituents at 1,2,3,4—so positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ring has symmetry. The substituents are at 1,2,3,4. The ring would have a certain symmetry. Let me visualize: positions 1,2,3,4 are substituted with methyl groups. Positions 5 and 6 are H. So how are these Hs arranged? Are they in equivalent positions?

Wait, if I rotate the ring 180 degrees, position 5 would swap with position 1, but that's a substituent. Hmm, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So perhaps the two Hs in positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. So their NMR would be a singlet.

Alternatively, maybe it's para positions, but no, in 1,2,3,4 substitution, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4, then the ring would look something like this:

Positions: 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (H), 6 (H).

Now, considering the symmetry, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane along the 1-4 axis. If so, then the H in position 5 would be equivalent to the H in position 6. So their NMR would be a singlet.

So in this case, the aromatic region would show a singlet integrating for 2 H. So when the compound is in the mixture, it would contribute a singlet at 6.7 ppm. So that's one compound.

The other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let's see the positions:

Positions 1,2,3,5 are methyl. So the H's are at 4 and 6.

Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me think about the structure's symmetry. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then positions 4 and 6 are across from each other. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric about a certain axis. Let me imagine: substituents at 1,2,3,5. If you consider the ring, maybe the molecule is symmetric across the axis that goes through position 4 and position 6, but no, position 5 is methyl. Wait, maybe it's a mirror plane. Hmm, perhaps the H at position 4 and 6 are not equivalent.

Wait, perhaps if you look at the substituents, substituents are at 1,2,3,5: so positions 4 and 6 are each adjacent to substituents. But are they in equivalent environments?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5 (both methyl), and position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So positions 4 and 6 each have two methyl neighbors. But wait, position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So the environments are the same. So the two Hs (positions 4 and 6) would be equivalent, and their NMR would be a singlet.

So each of the two compounds in option A would have a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, each integrating to 2 H. So in the NMR, each would give a singlet, and because it's a 1:1 mixture, the peaks would be in a 1:1 ratio. That matches the data given.

So that's the aromatic part. Now, the other signals are at 2.2 ppm, three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These are likely from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings.

Each compound has four methyl groups attached to the benzene. But depending on their positions, some methyl groups might be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. For each compound, how many different types of methyl groups are present?

Option A's first compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let's see: considering the symmetry, perhaps positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. Wait, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let me think about the dihedral angles. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some methyl groups equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are in a square arrangement around the ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent. So the molecule is like 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted benzene. Now, in this structure, are any of the methyl groups equivalent? Let's see: methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Methyl at position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Methyl at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Methyl at 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Wait, but substituents are at 1,2,3,4, so the positions 5 and 6 are H. So in this structure, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Because the ring is symmetric across a plane that passes through positions 1 and 4 and the opposite side.

So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be equivalent, giving a singlet, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be equivalent, giving another singlet. But wait, how many methyl groups are there? Four, so if 1 and 4 are equivalent, that's two methyls, and 2 and 3 are equivalent, that's another two. So in the NMR, two sets of methyl groups. So their signals would be two singlets, each integrating for two methyl groups (but wait, each group is two CH3, so each would integrate to 6 H? Or wait, each methyl group is three H. So two equivalent methyl groups would give a peak integrating for 6 H. Wait, but in the NMR data, we have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound contributes a certain number of methyl groups, but when mixed, their signals add up.

Wait, but the question says that there are three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the sum of all methyl groups from both compounds must have three different types, with their respective integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let's think about each compound's methyl groups and how they contribute to the NMR.

First, for the first compound in option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

As discussed, it has two sets of equivalent methyl groups: let's say group A (positions 1 and 4) and group B (positions 2 and 3). Each group has two methyls. So in the NMR, this would give two signals: group A integrating for 6 H (two CH3) and group B integrating for another 6 H. So two signals from this compound.

The other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its substituents. Positions 1,2,3,5 are methyl. So the H's are at 4 and 6, which we thought are equivalent. Now, the methyl groups: groups at 1,2,3,5.

Are any of these equivalent? Let's see. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the ring is substituted at four positions, but not all adjacent. Positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, and 5 is across from 4. So perhaps the symmetry is different here.

In this case, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, because they are symmetric across a certain axis. Let's see: position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4. Wait, but substituent at 5 is methyl. So the structure might be less symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1,2,3,5 cause the methyl groups to split into different environments.

Wait, perhaps the methyl at position 5 is in a different environment compared to the others. Let me think: the other methyl groups are at 1,2,3. So the methyl at 5 is across from position 4 (which is H in this case) and next to 4 and 6. Wait, but 4 is H in this compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and the methyl at 2 and 5 are also equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's see: if the plane is along the 4-5 axis, then position 1 would mirror to position 3, and position 2 would mirror to itself. Wait, position 2 is in the middle. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C2 axis. If the molecule is rotated 180 degrees, perhaps positions 1 and 3 would swap, and 2 would stay the same, but position 5 would swap with position 5. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1,2,3,5 make each methyl group unique. That would give four distinct methyl groups, but that can't be, because in the NMR data, there are only three signals. So perhaps the methyl groups in this compound are split into two or three sets.

Wait, perhaps in this structure, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So that would be two sets of two methyl groups each. So the NMR would show two signals from this compound.

But wait, in that case, each compound would contribute two signals (the first compound has two, the second has two). So the total would be four signals. But in the data, there are three signals. So perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about each possible option and analyze their NMR signals.

The question mentions that the three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total integration is 2 +1 +1 =4. Each integral corresponds to the number of H in each group. Wait, each methyl group is 3 H. So let's think in terms of groups.

If the three signals are in 2:1:1 ratio, that could mean:

- The first signal integrates for 6 H (2 groups of CH3)
- Second: 3 H (1 group)
- Third: 3 H (1 group)

So in total, 6 +3 +3=12 H from CH3 groups. Since each compound has four CH3 groups, that's 4 *2 =8 CH3 groups, but wait, no: each compound is tetramethyl (four CH3), so two compounds would have 8 CH3 groups. But 8 CH3 groups would be 8 *3=24 H. But in the NMR, the integral is 12 H. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the integral is for the sum of all protons in the three signals, which is 2:1:1. The total is 4 parts. So 2 parts would be 6 H, 1 part is 3 H, another part is 3 H. So 6 +3 +3 =12 H. So 12 H from CH3 groups.

But each CH3 is 3 H, so 12 H would correspond to 4 CH3 groups. So in the mixture, the sum of all CH3 groups is 4. But wait, each compound is a tetramethyl (4 CH3), so two compounds would have 8 CH3. How does this reconcile?

Ah, wait, no: the integral in the NMR is for the mixture. So the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. So each contributes their own CH3 groups. So if each compound has four CH3, the mixture would have 4 +4 =8 CH3 groups. But the NMR shows 12 H in the three signals. 8 CH3 groups would be 24 H, but the data says 12 H. That can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the 2:1:1 ratio is not the integral of H, but the area. So for each signal, the ratio is 2:1:1, meaning one signal is twice as high as the others. So perhaps the CH3 groups are in proportions 2:1:1.

Wait, but each CH3 is a singlet, which implies that each set is a unique environment and none are split by neighboring Hs.

So perhaps for each compound, the CH3 groups split into multiple signals, and when mixed, the total is three signals.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at each option and see what their CH3 groups would look like.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me see: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

So positions 3 and 6 are H. Are the H's at 3 and 6 equivalent? Let's see. The substituents at 1 and 2 are adjacent, then 4 and 5 are adjacent. So structure-wise, perhaps this molecule has a symmetry that makes the H's at 3 and 6 equivalent.

As for the methyl groups: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent?

Looking at substituents 1 and 4: are they in equivalent positions? If you rotate the ring 180 degrees, substituent 1 would move to position 4, and substituent 2 would move to position 5. So perhaps substituents 1 and 4 are equivalent, and substituents 2 and 5 are also equivalent. So in this case, the methyl groups would be in two sets: two methyl groups are equivalent at 1 and 4, and another two at 2 and 5.

So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups would split into two signals: each set of two CH3. So in the NMR, one singlet integrating for 6 H (two methyl groups) and another integrating for 6 H (the other two methyl groups).

Wait, but that's two signals. So when mixed with another compound, perhaps the other compound has three types of CH3 groups.

Wait, the other compound in option B is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Earlier, I thought that this compound has two sets of CH3 groups: two in positions 1 and 4 (equivalent) and two in positions 2 and 3 (equivalent). So when mixed, the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would contribute two signals (each 6 H), and the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would contribute two signals (each 6 H). But the NMR shows three signals, so perhaps this is not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total CH3 groups from both compounds. If each gives two signals, that would be four signals, but the NMR shows three. So option B can't be the answer, perhaps.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, diethyl is CH2CH3, so 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Let me think about its structure.

In this case, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the ethyl groups are para to each other. Now, the CH2 groups in the ethyl would be attached to the ring, each with their own sets.

In this structure, the ethyl groups are at 1 and 4. Each ethyl group would have two sets of protons: the CH2 next to the ring and the CH3 at the end.

But wait, the question states that the three signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets. So no splitting. So, for the ethyl groups, the CH2 and CH3 would be in different environments.

Wait, each ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The CH2 attached to the ring would be in a different environment than the CH3. So each ethyl would give two signals: the CH2 and the CH3. But since there are two ethyl groups, perhaps the CH2 and CH3 from each ethyl are equivalent.

So in 1,4-diethylbenzene, each ethyl group would have two types of H: the CH2 and CH3. So in the NMR, for each ethyl group, we would see two signals. So for two ethyl groups, perhaps we have two sets of CH2 and two sets of CH3. But wait, if the ethyl groups are in para positions, maybe their CH2 and CH3 groups are equivalent. So the CH2's would be a singlet, and the CH3's would be another singlet.

Wait, but let me think about it. For 1,4-diethylbenzene, each ethyl is attached to the ring. So the CH2's on each ethyl are in the same environment as the other CH2, and the CH3's are also in the same environment. So there would be two signals: one for all CH2 protons, and another for all CH3 protons.

But wait, the ethyl group is -CH2-CH3. The CH2 is attached to the ring. So each CH2 would have two H's, and each CH3 has three H's. But if the two ethyl groups are identical, their CH2 and CH3 would be equivalent, leading to two singlets: one for all CH2 (4 H, since two ethyl groups each contribute 2 H), and one for all CH3 (6 H, since two ethyl groups each contribute 3 H).

Wait, but the NMR data shows three signals at 2.2 ppm. So if the diethylbenzene contributes two signals (CH2 and CH3), and the tetramethylbenzene contributes one or two signals, the total could be three.

Let's take the tetramethylbenzene in option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its CH3 groups.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5.

So the CH3 groups are at positions 1,2,3,5. Are any of these CH3 groups equivalent?

As before, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent? Let me see: substituent 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H), substituent 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). Hmm, maybe 1 and 5 are in similar environments.

Alternatively, considering the substituents, perhaps positions 1 and 3 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 5 are equivalent. No, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, which are H's. So perhaps it's symmetric.

Alternatively, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry that makes some CH3 groups equivalent.

Wait, maybe the tetramethylbenzene in option C (1,2,3,5) has three equivalent CH3 groups and one different. That would lead to two signals: three CH3 in one environment and one in another.

Wait, but how? Let's imagine substituents at 1,2,3,5. The CH3 at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H). CH3 at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. CH3 at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4 (H). CH3 at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). So perhaps the CH3 at 5 is in a different environment than the others. So in this case, the CH3 groups at 1,2,3 would be in one environment, and the CH3 at 5 would be another. So in the NMR, two signals: one for three CH3 groups (each contributes 3 H, so 9 H) and another for one CH3 (3 H).

Wait, no: each CH3 is a group of three H. If three groups are equivalent, they would contribute 3 *3=9 H. The fourth is 3 H. So two signals: 9 H and 3 H. So when mixed with 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contributes two signals (CH2 and CH3), the total signals would be:

From tetramethyl: two signals (9 H and 3 H)
From diethyl: two signals (4 H and 6 H)
But wait, the question says three signals. So perhaps some of these signals combine.

Wait, the diethylbenzene would have CH2 (4 H) and CH3 (6 H) as two signals. The tetramethyl would have two signals. But in the NMR, there are three signals. So perhaps one of the signals from the tetramethyl and the diethyl coincide, making it a single peak.

But the diethyl's CH2 is probably around δ 1.5-2.0, but the CH3 would be around δ 0.9-1.3. Wait, but the data says all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. So maybe I'm wrong about the diethyl's CH2 and CH3 regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the chemical shifts.

Methyl groups attached to benzene rings are typically around δ 2.3-2.5 ppm. Ethyl groups' CH3 are generally around δ 1.2 ppm, and the CH2 attached to the ring might be around δ 2.2 ppm.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in ethylbenzene, the CH2 next to the benzene is usually around δ 1.2 (the CH2CH3 group's CH2 is split into a quartet around 1.2 ppm, but maybe if it's para diethyl, the coupling is different. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of diethylbenzene, the CH2 groups are more deshielded, so their shift is higher, around 2.2 ppm.

So if the diethylbenzene contributes a CH2 signal at 2.2 ppm (4 H) and a CH3 signal at a lower ppm (say, 1.2 ppm), but the data says all three signals are around 2.2. So perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, option C might not explain the NMR data because two of the signals would be elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider. Let's look at another option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First, the first compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

As before, substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 have H. Are the CH3 groups in this compound equivalent?

Looking at substituents: positions 1 and 4 are across from each other (if it's a para arrangement), and positions 2 and 5 are across as well. So substituents 1 and 4 are para, and substituents 2 and5 are para. So the molecule has a certain symmetry.

In this structure, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, this would give two signals: each integrating to 6 H (two CH3 groups).

The other compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Earlier analysis suggested that in this structure, the CH3 groups at 1,2,3 are equivalent in one environment, and the CH3 at 5 is in a different environment. So two signals: 9 H (from three CH3) and 3 H (from one CH3).

So when mixed, the first compound (1,2,4,5) contributes two signals (6 H each), and the second (1,2,3,5) contributes two signals (9 H and 3 H).

Wait, but in the NMR, there are three signals. So perhaps one of the signals overlaps or is split into another. Alternatively, maybe the CH3 groups in the first compound (1,2,4,5) are in such a way that when mixed with the second, the signals combine.

Wait, the NMR shows three signals: 2:1:1 ratio. So the total H from CH3 is 2+1+1 =4 parts. But each part corresponds to the integral. If the three signals are from the CH3 groups, each would be a certain number of H.

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two sets of CH3: set A (6 H) and set B (6 H). The second compound (1,2,3,5) has set C (9 H) and set D (3 H). But when mixed, the signals would combine if any are overlapping.

Wait, is there any chance that in the two compounds, some CH3 groups are equivalent? For example, if in both compounds, there's a CH3 group in a certain position, their signals would overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the two compounds in option D have some CH3 groups that are in similar environments, leading to overlapping signals. Let me think.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are at positions 1 and 4 (equivalent) and 2 and5 (equivalent).

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are at 1,2,3 (equivalent) and 5 (different).

So in the first compound, the CH3 at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and in the second compound, CH3 at 1,2,3 are equivalent. Are these groups in the same environment? Or are they different?

Wait, the environment of a CH3 depends on the substituents around it. For example, in the first compound, the CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (H), but in the second compound, the CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (H). Wait, but in the second compound, substituent at 3 is also a CH3. So the environments are different.

Hmm, perhaps not. Therefore, the CH3 groups from the two compounds might be in different environments, leading to separate signals.

So for the first compound (1,2,4,5): two signals (6 H each).

Second compound (1,2,3,5): two signals (9 H, 3 H).

Thus, in the mixture, we would have four signals, but the data shows three. So this can't be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are overlapping? No, because 9 H is one signal, 6 H is another.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the chemical shifts. Maybe in the two compounds, some CH3 groups are in the same environment and thus have the same chemical shift, leading to their signals merging.

For example, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 at position 1 is in a certain environment. In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 at 1 is in a different environment. So their shifts would be different, leading to separate signals.

But perhaps in some cases, like the CH3 at position 2 in both compounds, their environments are similar. Wait, in the first compound, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (CH3) and 3 (H). In the second compound, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (CH3) and 3 (CH3). So different environments, so different shifts.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's go back to the data.

The three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So possible integrals could be 6 H, 3 H, 3 H (if considering 2 parts to 1 part to 1 part). Or, if each is a different number, perhaps 4 H, 2 H, 2 H.

Wait, but each CH3 is 3 H. So the only way to get integrals in 2:1:1 is to have either two CH3 groups (6 H), and two single CH3 (3 H each), but that would sum to 6+3+3=12. Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the number of groups, not H. So two groups, each contributing 3 H, and one group contributing 3 H. But that would be 3 groups, 3 H each, which is 9 H. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the ratio refers to the area, not the number of H. So the areas are in 2:1:1. For example, one signal is twice as high as the others. So perhaps one signal has 6 H, and the other two have 3 H each (6:3:3 = 2:1:1).

So the three signals are 6 H, 3 H, and 3 H. So in total, 12 H.

Since each compound contributes four CH3 groups (each CH3 is 3 H), two compounds would contribute 8 CH3 (24 H). But wait, the three signals sum to 12 H. That doesn't add up. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio refers to the number of groups, not H. So two groups contribute twice as much as the others. For example, two groups each with 3 H (total 6 H) and two groups with 3 H each (total 6 H). But that would not explain a 2:1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, the three signals could be for two different types of methyl groups, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to think again about each option.

Option D: compounds 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound:

Methyl groups at 1,2,4,5.

Symmetry: likely two sets (positions 1 &4; 2&5), each giving a singlet. So two signals: each 6 H.

Second compound: methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.

Symmetry: perhaps the CH3 at 1,2,3 are equivalent (so 9 H) and CH3 at 5 is different (3 H), so two signals.

When mixed, the first contributes two signals (6 H each), second contributes two signals (9 H and 3 H).

Total signals: four. But the NMR shows three.

Hmm, so this can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the two CH3 groups from the first compound (each 6 H) and the CH3 groups from the second (9 H and 3 H) combine in such a way that one of the signals overlaps.

Wait, but unless the chemical shifts are the same, which is unlikely unless the environments are identical.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some symmetry in the compounds.

Let me think about the first compound in option D again: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, the molecule is symmetrical along a certain axis. So perhaps the CH3 groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the CH3 groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent.

Thus, in this case, the CH3 groups would be in two sets: each set has two CH3, so each gives a signal of 6 H.

The second compound in option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The CH3 groups at 1,2,3 are in one set, and 5 is another.

So the CH3 groups would be in two sets: three CH3 (9 H) and one CH3 (3 H).

When these two compounds are mixed, the signals from the first compound (6 H and 6 H) and the second (9 H and 3 H) would add up to four signals. But the data shows three, so perhaps this is not the correct option.

Wait, perhaps the diethylbenzene in option C could contribute three signals, but earlier analysis suggested it would contribute two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene's CH3 groups split into two signals, and the tetramethylbenzene's CH3 groups into two, but one of them coincides. Let's see.

In option C:

First compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. CH3 groups: 9 H and 3 H.

Second compound: 1,4-diethylbenzene. CH3 groups: 6 H (two CH3) and CH2 groups: 4 H.

But the CH2's chemical shift might be around 2.2 ppm. So in this case, the three signals would be:

- 9 H (from tetramethyl)
- 6 H (from diethyl's CH3)
- 4 H (from diethyl's CH2)
and another 3 H (from tetramethyl's other CH3), but wait, that's four signals. But the data shows three.

Hmm, perhaps the diethyl's CH2 and one of the tetramethyl's CH3 have the same shift, causing them to merge into one signal. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 and the tetramethyl's 3 H CH3 have the same shift, leading to a combined signal. But that's not very likely unless their environments are identical.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

The aromatic signals are two singlets at 6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio. So each compound has one set of equivalent aromatic H, integrating to 2 H each.

The other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio. So 6 H, 3 H, 3 H.

Looking for a pair of compounds where one has two types of CH3 (each contributing 6 H), and the other has CH3 groups that sum to 6 H and 3 H. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: for each option, check how many distinct CH3 groups each compound has, then see if when mixed, the total would be three signals.

Option A: two compounds, each has two types of CH3.

First compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Two types of CH3 (each 6 H). So when mixed, each contributes 6 H, but in a 1:1 ratio, so each would be a singlet with 6 H. But in the data, the three signals are 2:1:1, which is 6, 3, 3.

So perhaps the other compound has three CH3 groups, but that's not possible because it's a tetramethyl.

Wait, no: the other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has two types of CH3 (9 H and 3 H).

When mixed, their CH3 signals would be:

From first compound: two signals (each 6 H).
From second compound: two signals (9 H and 3 H).

But the data shows three signals. So perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are separate, making four signals total. Doesn't fit.

Option B: two compounds, each with two types of CH3.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two signals (each 6 H).

Second compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two signals (each 6 H).

When mixed, four signals. Not matching.

Option C: first compound (tetramethyl) has two CH3 signals (9 H and 3 H), second compound (diethyl) has two signals (4 H and 6 H). So four signals. Doesn't match.

Option D: first compound (1,2,4,5) has two signals (6 H each). Second compound (1,2,3,5) has two signals (9 H and 3 H). Total four signals. Not matching.

Wait, but the data shows three signals. So perhaps one of the compounds in one of the options has three types of CH3 groups, and the other has one. Let me see.

Wait, let's consider 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Are there three types of CH3 groups? No, because substituents are at 1,2,3,4. The CH3 groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and 2 and 3 are equivalent. So only two types.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has three types of CH3 groups. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, perhaps the CH3 at 1 is in a different environment than those at 2 and 3, and the CH3 at 5 is another. So three types: 1, 2/3, and 5. So three signals.

In that case, the signals would be:

- CH3 at 1: 3 H.
- CH3 at 2 and 3: 6 H.
- CH3 at 5: 3 H.

So when mixed with another compound that has two types of CH3 (each 6 H), the total would be five signals. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the correct answer. The correct answer is likely option D or option B.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are two singlets. So each compound must have a single set of equivalent aromatic H.

In option D, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, so one singlet (2 H). For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H at 4 and 6 would be equivalent, so another singlet (2 H). Thus, the aromatic region would show two singlets, each integrating to 2 H. Which matches the data.

Now, the methyl groups:

First compound (1,2,4,5): two types of CH3 (each 6 H).

Second compound (1,2,3,5): two types of CH3 (9 H and 3 H).

Thus, when mixed, the four CH3 would give four signals. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps one of the signals overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene (in option C) would have a different contribution. Wait, no, option C is a different pair.

Wait, perhaps the 9 H and 6 H signals are merged into a single peak, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 is at the same shift as one of the other signals.

I'm going to have to make a best guess here. The aromatic region fits option D because each compound has a single set of equivalent H. Now, for the CH3 signals: if the first compound contributes two signals (6 H each), and the second contributes one signal (9 H) and another (3 H), but perhaps the 9 H and 6 H from the first compound combine, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the first compound's CH3 groups are in two sets (6 H each), and the second's are in two sets (9 and 3). So when mixed, the first's two signals are 6 H each, but the second's are 9 H and 3 H. So the total signals are four. But the NMR shows three, so option D can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: in the NMR, the three CH3 signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one of the compounds contributes a single CH3 signal (6 H), and the other contributes two signals (3 H and 3 H). But each compound is a tetramethyl, which has four CH3. So how?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one of the compounds has two equivalent CH3 groups (6 H), and the other has three equivalent CH3 groups. But that's impossible because they have four CH3 each.

Wait, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 would be 6 H (two CH3), and the tetramethyl's CH3 would split into two signals (6 H and 6 H), but that would make three signals: 6,6,6. No, the ratio would be 1:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH3 is 6 H, and the tetramethyl's CH3 groups are 6 H and 6 H, but that's not matching the 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the CH3 signals. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The correct answer is likely option D, because each compound in D has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, giving two singlets in the aromatic region. For the methyl groups, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two types of CH3 (each 6 H), and the second (1,2,3,5) has CH3 groups that, when mixed, combine into a single peak. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the three signals' integrals are 6 H, 3 H, 3 H. So one signal from the first compound (6 H), and two from the second (3 H each). So for the first compound, perhaps it contributes a single 6 H signal, implying that all four CH3 groups are equivalent. But that's impossible because in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the CH3 groups are in two sets.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds contributes a 6 H signal and the other contributes two 3 H signals.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The aromatic region fits option D, and perhaps the CH3 signals also fit. So I'll go with option D.


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture, both with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄**, based on their **¹H NMR** data. The aromatic region shows **two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio**, and the aliphatic region shows **three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio**. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Region**:
   - The two singlets at 6.7 ppm indicate that each compound has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, integrating to 2 H each. This suggests that the compounds have high symmetry, making the remaining aromatic protons equivalent.

2. **Aliphatic Region**:
   - The three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio correspond to methyl groups. The total integration suggests one signal for 6 H (two methyl groups) and two signals for 3 H each (one methyl group each). This implies that the compounds have methyl groups in distinct environments.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/3 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region (two from each compound), which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option B**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/5 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/3 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **Conclusion**: This option also produces four signals in the aliphatic region, which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option C**: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **1,4-diethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1 and 4 leave positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The ethyl groups contribute two signals in the aliphatic region: one for the CH₂ groups (4 H) and one for the CH₃ groups (6 H).
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region (two from each compound), which does not match the observed three signals.

#### **Option D**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/4 and 2/5 are equivalent, resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 as equivalent aromatic protons, giving a singlet at 6.7 ppm.
  - The methyl groups at positions 1/2/3 are equivalent (9 H), and the methyl group at position 5 is distinct (3 H), resulting in two signals in the aliphatic region.
- **Conclusion**: This option produces four signals in the aliphatic region, which does not match the observed three signals.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, **Option D** is the most consistent with the aromatic region data, as each compound has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons. However, the aliphatic region data (three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio) does not perfectly match any option. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the best answer.

**Answer: D**
