Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas in the photosphere is in equilibrium and follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for energy levels.

Wait, so when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, I think that refers to the population of the higher energy level being twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the excitation energy? No, I think it's the population ratio. So the number of atoms in the higher energy level (let's say level 2) relative to a lower one (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, the question says that in star_1, the excitation (n2/n1) is twice that of star_2. So n2/n1 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Each R is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), assuming g2 and g1 are the same for both stars, which they probably are since it's about the same element and same energy levels. So we can ignore the statistical weights since they are the same for both stars. So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

So R1 = 2 R2. Substituting the expressions, exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(kT2)).

Wait, let's write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 is positive if T is positive, but wait the signs. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation after taking ln was:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Wait no, wait, let me re-express the equation correctly.

Original equation after substitution: exp(A) = 2 exp(B), where A = -ΔE/(k T1), B = -ΔE/(k T2).

Taking ln of both sides: A = ln(2) + B.

So substituting:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Then, bring the ΔE terms to the same side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should factor it as [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ].

Wait, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So plugging that in:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait, the question is about the effective temperatures T1 and T2. We need to find an equation that relates T1 and T2 with ln(2) on one side.

Alternatively, perhaps rearranging the equation to solve for something else. Let me see.

Alternatively, from the equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

We can write [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

But wait, the question states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what ΔE/(k) is. Because k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K? Because k*T would be 1.38e-23 J when T is 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back, [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE. Wait, but wait, earlier equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = k * (1 K), so ΔE/k = 1 K.

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k * 1, so this becomes (ln(2) * k ) / (k * 1) ) = ln(2) * (k/(k*1)) ) = ln(2) * 1.

Wait no, wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the equation is:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

But ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T, but for T=1 K, right? So ΔE = k * (1 K).

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

But K is just a unit, so 1 * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait no, wait, because the equation is [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)/(ΔE/k). Wait, no, let's go back.

Wait, the equation is:

ΔE/(k) * [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

But ΔE/(k) = 1 K (since ΔE=k*1 K). So:

1 K * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, no, 1 K is just a number, but the equation is:

[ (ΔE)/(k) ) ] * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which becomes:

1 K * [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Wait, no, because ΔE/(k) is 1 K, but in the equation it's (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1), which is (1 K) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) K^-1, so the units are (K * 1/K) )= dimensionless, which matches the RHS, ln(2) is dimensionless.

So the equation becomes:

1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, that can't be right because it would imply 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). But looking at the options, none of them directly have 1/T2 - 1/T1. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me go back.

The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

From Boltzmann, (n2/n1) = exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Taking natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Rearranging terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2).

As before. But since ΔE = k * 1 K (since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k=1.38e-23 J/K), then ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So 1 K * (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But that would make (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/(1 K) ) → which is ln(2) per Kelvin. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the units would be 1/K, but ln(2) is unitless. So perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Let me think again. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Wait, but Boltzmann's equation is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming g2/g1 is the same for both stars, so I can write:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Bringing the terms involving T to one side:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

(ΔE/k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (1.38e-23 J/K), so ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) =1 K.

So substituting,

1 K [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, but 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) which is in 1/K. So the product is dimensionless, matching ln(2), which is correct.

So, 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (1 K) )? No, wait, because 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2). So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/1 K. But that's not dimensionally correct because ln(2) is unitless. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should express the equation without substituting ΔE/k. Let's see.

We have:

(ΔE / k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k * 1 K.

So (k*1 K) / k = 1 K.

So equation becomes:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)/(1 K) → but that can't be right because the units wouldn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to not substitute ΔE/k numerically yet and see what the equation looks like in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, let me write it again:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

But ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k, so ΔE = k. So,

k/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which simplifies to:

(1) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Rearranging:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, let's see. Let's manipulate the equation 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2.

Rearranged, this gives:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies, and the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \( T_1 T_2 \) to clear the denominators:

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1 T_2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

Or wait, maybe it's the excitation energy? No, I think it's the population ratio. So the number of atoms in the higher energy level (let's say level 2) relative to a lower one (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, the question says that in star_1, the excitation (n2/n1) is twice that of star_2. So n2/n1 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Each R is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), assuming g2 and g1 are the same for both stars, which they probably are since it's about the same element and same energy levels. So we can ignore the statistical weights since they are the same for both stars. So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

So R1 = 2 R2. Substituting the expressions, exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(kT2)).

Wait, let's write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 is positive if T is positive, but wait the signs. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation after taking ln was:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Wait no, wait, let me re-express the equation correctly.

Original equation after substitution: exp(A) = 2 exp(B), where A = -ΔE/(k T1), B = -ΔE/(k T2).

Taking ln of both sides: A = ln(2) + B.

So substituting:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Then, bring the ΔE terms to the same side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should factor it as [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ].

Wait, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So plugging that in:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait, the question is about the effective temperatures T1 and T2. We need to find an equation that relates T1 and T2 with ln(2) on one side.

Alternatively, perhaps rearranging the equation to solve for something else. Let me see.

Alternatively, from the equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

We can write [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

But wait, the question states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what ΔE/(k) is. Because k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K? Because k*T would be 1.38e-23 J when T is 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back, [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE. Wait, but wait, earlier equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = k * (1 K), so ΔE/k = 1 K.

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k * 1, so this becomes (ln(2) * k ) / (k * 1) ) = ln(2) * (k/(k*1)) ) = ln(2) * 1.

Wait no, wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the equation is:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

But ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T, but for T=1 K, right? So ΔE = k * (1 K).

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

But K is just a unit, so 1 * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

So [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait no, wait, because the equation is [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)/(ΔE/k). Wait, no, let's go back.

Wait, the equation is:

ΔE/(k) * [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

But ΔE/(k) = 1 K (since ΔE=k*1 K). So:

1 K * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, no, 1 K is just a number, but the equation is:

[ (ΔE)/(k) ) ] * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which becomes:

1 K * [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Wait, no, because ΔE/(k) is 1 K, but in the equation it's (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1), which is (1 K) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) K^-1, so the units are (K * 1/K) )= dimensionless, which matches the RHS, ln(2) is dimensionless.

From Boltzmann, (n2/n1) = exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Taking natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Rearranging terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2).

As before. But since ΔE = k * 1 K (since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k=1.38e-23 J/K), then ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So 1 K * (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But that would make (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/(1 K) ) → which is ln(2) per Kelvin. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the units would be 1/K, but ln(2) is unitless. So perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Let me think again. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Wait, but Boltzmann's equation is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming g2/g1 is the same for both stars, so I can write:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Bringing the terms involving T to one side:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

(ΔE/k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (1.38e-23 J/K), so ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) =1 K.

So substituting,

1 K [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, but 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) which is in 1/K. So the product is dimensionless, matching ln(2), which is correct.

So, 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (1 K) )? No, wait, because 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2). So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/1 K. But that's not dimensionally correct because ln(2) is unitless. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should express the equation without substituting ΔE/k. Let's see.

We have:

(ΔE / k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k * 1 K.

So (k*1 K) / k = 1 K.

So equation becomes:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)/(1 K) → but that can't be right because the units wouldn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to not substitute ΔE/k numerically yet and see what the equation looks like in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, let me write it again:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

But ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k, so ΔE = k. So,

k/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which simplifies to:

(1) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Rearranging:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, let's see. Let's manipulate the equation 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2.

Rearranged, this gives:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies, and the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \( T_1 T_2 \) to clear the denominators:

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1 T_2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
