Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I need to remember what each symmetry entails. So, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So Poincare is kind of a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz.

CP symmetry is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal, and it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that include spin-½ particles I think.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? Well, the SM is Lorentz invariant, and it has gauge symmetries like SU(2), SU(3), U(1), but SMEFT is a broader theory, so maybe it's more about the symmetries that are enforced beyond the gauge.

I recall that in SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the SM itself is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on top of it.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations. SMEFT operators are constructed as local operators, but when you integrate them into the action, you have to ensure that the theory is Poincare invariant. Wait, but the operators themselves are terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which transforms in a way that when integrated, gives the same result under Poincare. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and have the right transformation properties under other symmetries.

Wait, maybe the SMEFT operators are built to be Lorentz scalars, so they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare symmetry includes more than just Lorentz; it includes translations. So, in the Lagrangian, terms must transform as scalar densities, which includes their behavior under translations. But the way operators are constructed, like using the field strength tensors and covariant derivatives, should already account for that. So I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, but wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are written to be invariant under Lorentz symmetry (so they're Lorentz scalars), but do they have to respect Poincare? I'm not entirely sure. Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But in an effective theory, perhaps the form of the operators doesn't depend on where you are in spacetime, so they are automatically Poincare invariant.

Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible interactions that are consistent with the SM symmetries. So the SM has Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT must respect that as well. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, meaning options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, looking at the other options, CP and CPT. Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP symmetry? I don't think so. Because the SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP, as long as the SM doesn't already forbid it. For example, certain higher-dimensional operators could lead to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't have to individually respect CP symmetry. However, the SM is CP-violating in certain cases (like in the CKM matrix), but the question is about whether operators must respect these symmetries.

Wait, in the SM, the operators respect CPT symmetry but not necessarily CP. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. But I'm not sure if the SMEFT operators have to respect CPT. Wait, no, I think the operators themselves don't have to respect CPT symmetry. Wait, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT. Because any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT, right? Because in quantum field theory, the combination of CPT must be a symmetry if the theory is Lorentz invariant and unitary.

Wait, but each operator doesn't necessarily have to be CPT invariant on their own. Instead, the entire theory must be CPT symmetric. So individual operators can have terms that may not be CPT invariant, but when combined, the whole theory is.

Wait, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators can violate individual symmetries like C, P, or T, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. So, each operator doesn't have to be CPT symmetric; the sum must be. But the question is about what each operator must respect. So, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but they don't have to be CPT scalars themselves.

Similarly, for CP symmetry: operators can violate CP, so the operators don't have to respect CP. So, the operators are not required to respect CP. But they do have to respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about CPT? Since the theory must respect CPT (as it's a Lorentz-invariant theory), but individual operators don't have to. Because if you have CPT-odd operators, their presence would have to be balanced by other terms to maintain overall CPT invariance. But each operator in the SMEFT can have terms that are CPT-even or CPT-odd. So, operators don't need to individually respect CPT symmetry; it's the theory as a whole that must.

Wait, but how are operators constructed in SMEFT? Each operator is a Lorentz scalar, so it's a scalar under Lorentz. But what about CPT? I think that each operator is a Lorentz scalar but could transform as a scalar or pseudoscalar under CPT. So, for example, the operator could be a scalar (even under CPT) or a pseudoscalar (odd under CPT). So operators don't have to respect CPT themselves. So the operators don't have to be CPT-symmetric.

Wait, but when you write SMEFT operators, each term should be a Lorentz scalar. But what about their CPT properties? For example, the operator could be a scalar (CPT even) or a pseudoscalar (CPT odd). So operators can have terms that are CPT-even or CPT-odd. Therefore, the operators themselves don't have to respect CPT symmetry. So, the operators don't need to obey CPT symmetry.

So, that brings us back to the question: which symmetries must all operators respect? So, Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Poincare symmetry (2) would require that the operators are invariant under translations, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, because Poincare includes translations, and the SMEFT is built in such a way that the action is translationally invariant. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which includes correct transformation under translations. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and have the correct transformation under other symmetries, but I'm not sure if this requires Poincare symmetry as a separate condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are required to be Poincare-invariant. Poincare invariance is just a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since SMEFT is a translation-invariant theory, the operators must respect that. So, yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density, then the operators must be a scalar under Lorentz, and naturally, the Lagrangian is translationally invariant because it's a local theory.

So, SMEFT requires that all operators respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CPT symmetry? The theory as a whole must respect CPT, but individual operators don't have to. So, not all operators have to respect CPT; their sum must. So the operators aren't required to respect CPT (4 is not a must).

Similarly, for CP symmetry (3), operators can violate it, so option 3 is not a must.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare). Wait, but wait. Let's think again: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, then both 1 and 2 are correct. So the first two are correct.

Wait, but the question is "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". So which of the choices are correct?

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → So Lorentz and Poincare.

B) 3,4 → CP and CPT.

C) 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

D) 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT.

From my earlier reasoning, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. So that would be options 1 and 2, which is option A.

Wait, but another angle: The Poincare symmetry is a combination of the Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare also includes translation. Well, the operator being part of the Lagrangian implies that it transforms appropriately under translations, which are part of Poincare. So perhaps the SMEFT operators are constructed to respect Poincare, so 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the correct answer would include 1 and 2. So looking at the options, option A says 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait another point: The Poincare group includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators are written in a way that's invariant under Lorentz, do they also automatically respect translation? Because the operators are terms in the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each operator must be a scalar density, which implies it's invariant under translations? Because when you translate, you have to adjust the density so that the integral (the action) remains the same.

Wait, but when you translate, the fields change, but the operator is a function of the fields. So the operator itself doesn't have to change under translation because the fields are local. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe all operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant because the theory is Poincare-invariant. So 1 and 2 are correct.

So the correct answer is A) 1,2.

Wait, but another thought: The Poincare symmetry is required for the theory to be a local field theory, but the operators themselves don't have to be Poincare invariant. Because Poincare includes translations, but the operators are constructed at a point. So the operator O(x) doesn't have to transform under Poincare, because the theory's invariance is under global Poincare transformations. Wait, maybe I'm confusing global and local symmetries here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the SMEFT is a Lorentz invariant theory, which implies that all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Additionally, since SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant effective theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincare scalars. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but the operator's being a scalar under Lorentz and a scalar under translations (which is part of Poincare) would mean that they must respect both. So 1 and 2 are correct.

So the correct answer is A) 1 and 2.

But wait, I'm starting to get a bit uncertain. Another approach: in the SMEFT, the operators are built from SM fields, and each operator must form a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is essential. But for Poincare, since the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density, the operators must form a scalar density. So the operator itself must be a scalar under Lorentz and a scalar under translations. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1 and 2. So the answer would be A.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine this, we analyze each symmetry and its relevance to SMEFT operators.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement because SMEFT is built on the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM), which is Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a translation-invariant effective theory, the operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures that the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density, remains invariant under spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for SMEFT operators. The SM already allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not need to individually respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: While the SM and SMEFT as a whole respect CPT symmetry, individual operators do not need to be CPT-invariant. The theory ensures CPT invariance through the combination of operators, but there is no requirement for each operator to respect CPT symmetry on its own.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
