Okay, so I've got this question about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and their detection using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because I think the ultraviolet is around 10-400 nm, and 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV.

But the question is about detecting them with optical telescopes. Oh, because the absorbed light would be redshifted. Right, because as the universe expands, the wavelength stretches. So the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) line from these clouds would be shifted into a longer wavelength, possibly into the optical range if the redshift is high enough.

Wait, the quasar's light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda is lambda_rest * (1 + z). So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical range, which I think is about 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So, we need lambda >= 4000 Angstroms (since that's the start of optical in some definitions). Let me check: 1 micrometer is near-infrared, so optical is below that. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

So lambda >= 4000 Angstroms. But lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

Let's solve for z.

Divide both sides by 1216: 1 + z >= 4000 / 1216.

Calculate that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So 1 + z ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

So to have the observed wavelength be at least 4000 Angstroms, the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is around 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 2.29 is closer to 2.3 which isn't an option. Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm being a bit hasty. Let me recalculate: 4000 /1216 = ?

Let me compute 1216 ×3.3 = 1216 ×3 = 3648, 1216 ×0.3=364.8 → 3648+364.8=4012.8. Oh, so 3.3 ×1216 =4012.8 Angstroms. Which is just over 4000. So z=2.3 would give lambda=4012.8 Angstroms, which is just into the optical.

But the question says "estimate the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So if the redshift is z=2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, which is the start of optical. But since instruments have finite resolution, perhaps the lower limit is higher.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just at the optical threshold.

So 4000 Angstroms is the lower end of optical. So the minimal z would be when lambda_obs is 4000. So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1=2.29. So approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than this, but D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, so the minimal z is about 2.3. So the answer would be the option just above that. But wait, the options don't have 2.3.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) because of atmospheric absorption in the UV. Oh, right! The atmosphere blocks a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) in the optical. So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms needs to be redshifted beyond 3000 Angstroms to be seen.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is at higher wavelengths because of redshift. The neutral hydrogen cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is in the quasar's spectrum. So when the cloud is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line is observed at longer wavelengths. Since the quasar itself must emit light that, after passing through the cloud, has its Lyman alpha line shifted into a wavelength that the telescope can see.

Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha line would be at an even longer wavelength. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light, which passes through the intergalactic medium, which has neutral hydrogen clouds. These clouds absorb the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) from the quasar's light. When we observe this, the absorption line is at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

But for this absorption line to be in the optical range that a ground-based telescope can detect, the observed wavelength must be longer than 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) because below that, the atmosphere absorbs it (like the ozone layer blocking UV).

So, for the absorption line to be in the optical (i.e., observed wavelength > 3000 Angstroms), the cloud's redshift z must satisfy:

1216 (1 + z) > 3000 Angstroms.

So let's compute that:

1 + z > 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467.

So z > 1.467.

Hmm, that's like z ≈1.47. But that's way lower than the previous calculation. Wait, but earlier I thought the optical starts at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Maybe I got the definition wrong. So it's 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) which is near UV but perhaps within the range that can be observed from the ground.

Wait, but wait. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216 (1 + z). To be in the optical, which for ground-based telescopes, the cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), because below that, Earth's atmosphere doesn't let the light through (it's absorbed by the atmosphere, particularly by ozone). So for the absorption line to be visible, it must be in the range that the atmosphere allows.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216 (1 + z) = 3000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 3000 /1216 ≈ 2.467.

So z ≈1.467.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.467, and option B is 1.2 which is lower. So the lower limit would be z ≈1.467, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is D)1.9.

Wait, but why would the lower limit be 1.9? Because the minimal z is around 1.47, so any z above that would be detectable. So the lower limit is 1.47, so the minimal redshift is about 1.47. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the wavelength threshold.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha forest, which is a series of absorption lines in quasar spectra from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts. These absorption lines are observed in the optical range because the quasars themselves are at high redshifts. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms rest frame, so when observed, it's shifted to longer wavelengths.

But for a ground-based telescope to detect it, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) to avoid atmospheric absorption. So 1216 (1 + z) > 3000.

So 1 + z > 3000/1216 ≈2.467 → z>1.467.

So any z above about 1.47 would allow the Lyman alpha absorption to be in the observed optical range. So the minimal z is around 1.47, but looking at the options, the closest one is D)1.9, but that's higher than 1.47.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the lower end of the optical spectrum as 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Let me recalculate with 4000.

So 1216*(1 + z) =4000 → 1 + z =4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit would be about 2.29, which is close to option C)2.4 and D)1.9. Hmm, 2.29 is between option C and D.

Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is closer to 2.4. So the lower limit would be that z is at least 2.29, so the minimal is 2.29. So the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is C)2.4. But I'm not sure because the options don't have an exact match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, which starts at about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So the calculation would give z≈2.29.

In that case, the minimal z is about 2.3. Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is the next higher. So the correct answer would be C)2.4.

But wait, why would the lower limit be higher than 2.3? Maybe because the atmosphere also absorbs some of the longer wavelengths, but I don't think so. Or perhaps the quasar's own emission is redshifted into the optical, and the Lyman alpha absorption is at longer wavelengths.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) in the rest frame of the cloud. For this to be observed in the optical range (say, 4000 Angstroms or higher), the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

So solving for z:

z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is ~2.29. So the lowest redshift possible to enter the optical is about that. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.3. Among the options, only C is above that, so option C (2.4) is the answer.

Wait, but why is option D 1.9? Because if the redshift is 1.9, then 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms. 3526.4 is 352.6 nm, which is in the UV and would be absorbed by the atmosphere, making it undetectable by ground-based telescopes. So the observed wavelength must be beyond 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), but maybe for practical purposes, the lower limit is higher.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. On one hand, if the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) to be seen from the ground, then the minimal z is about 1.467, which would make option D (1.9) a possible answer. But if the optical is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then the minimal z is about 2.29, which would make option C the correct answer.

I think I need to clarify what wavelength range defines the optical for ground-based telescopes. From what I remember, Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (far UV). So any observed wavelength longer than that (i.e., redshifted beyond that) would be in the optical range. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =3000 → z≈ (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.467-1=1.467.

So any z higher than ~1.467 would make the Lyman alpha line observable from the ground. So the lower limit is z=1.467.

Looking at the options, the choices are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Wait, 1.467 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the minimal redshift is about 1.47, so the lower limit would be just above that. But none of the options exactly match. So the options don't have 1.47. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman-alpha line being in the visible spectrum (say, 500 nm or 5000 Angstroms) for detection. Let's recalculate:

lambda =1216*(1+z) =5000 → 1+z=5000/1216≈4.098 → z≈3.098. So that's above option A (3). But option A is 3, which would be higher than 3.098, so that's not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the standard Lyman-alpha forest. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelength) of the quasar's emission lines. These absorption lines are due to neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts along the line of sight. The Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical range when the cloud's redshift brings it into that range.

So for a ground-based telescope, the Lyman alpha line must be observed at wavelengths above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), as shorter wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z) =3000 → z≈1.467.

So any cloud with z>1.467 would have its Lyman alpha line in the optical range detectable from the ground.

Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the lower limit is about 1.47. So the minimal z is 1.47. The options have D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47. So that would allow the Lyman alpha line to be observed.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47, so any z >=1.47 can be detected. The question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z is 1.47. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the quasar's redshift. If the quasar itself is at a certain redshift, then the clouds in front of it would have to be at a higher redshift than the quasar. Wait, no. Quasars are typically very bright and at high redshifts. The Lyman alpha forest clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasars. Wait, no, that's not correct. The quasar's light comes from behind the clouds, so the clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasar. Or perhaps higher? Wait, no. The quasar is at a high redshift, and the clouds are at various lower redshifts along the line of sight. Because the quasar's light passes through material that is closer to us (lower redshifts) than the quasar itself.

Wait, no. Let me think: when we look at a quasar, which is at a high redshift (like z=2 or higher), the light passes through intergalactic clouds that are at various redshifts between us and the quasar. So the clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasar.

Wait, but if the quasar is at redshift z_q, then the clouds are at z_cloud < z_q.

But in this case, the question is about the clouds being detected. So the cloud's Lyman alpha line must be in the optical range. So for the cloud's z to satisfy 1216*(1+z_cloud) > 3000 Angstroms.

So z_cloud > (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z_cloud is about 1.47.

But in the options, the closest higher value is D)1.9, which is 1.9. So the lower limit is z_cloud ≈1.47, but the question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So any z_cloud >=1.47 would be detectable, meaning that the lower limit is z=1.47.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is D)1.9, assuming that the question expects the Lyman alpha to be in the visible spectrum (400 nm) and thus the redshift is about 2.29.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's own emission being in the optical, which would require a higher redshift, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The question is to find the minimal z such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical. So ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) because the atmosphere blocks it. Hence, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms.

So the minimal z is when 1216(1+z) =3000 → z= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. So the lower limit is z>1.47.

Looking at the options, D is 1.9, which is above 1.47, so any cloud with z=1.9 would have the Lyman alpha line in the detectable range. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal possible z is 1.47, so any z above that can be detected. So the lower limit is z=1.47, but that's not an option. So the question might be expecting that the Lyman alpha line must be in the visible range (400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), which would require higher z.

Wait, but 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is near UV. But perhaps the question considers optical to start at 400 nm. So let's redo:

1216 (1+z) =4000 → z= (4000/1216)-1 ≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. The option closest to that is C)2.4.

So the correct answer would be C)2.4.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the atmosphere allows some UV to pass. Like, for example, the HST can observe in UV, but ground-based can't. So perhaps the correct approach is considering that the minimal z is when the wavelength is just beyond what the atmosphere allows, which is 3000 Angstroms (300 nm). That would be z≈1.47.

But the options don't have that. So the available options are B)1.2 (which is lower than 1.47) and D)1.9. So if the minimal z is 1.47, then any cloud with z>1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D)1.9 because it's the smallest option above 1.47.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha line being redshifted into the visible spectrum (400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), which would require a higher z, around 2.3.

So considering the options, the answer would be C)2.4.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another point to consider: the Lyman-alpha absorption line is at 121.6 nm. To be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted to longer wavelengths. For a ground-based telescope, the maximum wavelength that can be observed is about 300 nm, but wait, no. Wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) because of atmospheric absorption. So wavelengths longer than 300 nm (like 350 nm, 400 nm) are in the near-UV and visible range, respectively.

So for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical (i.e., in the range that can pass through the atmosphere), it must be redshifted to wavelengths longer than 300 nm. So:

1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) > 3000 Angstroms → z > (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47, meaning that with z=1.9, the line is in the optical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be in the visible range (say, above 400 nm), which would require higher redshift.

So recalculate:

1216*(1 + z) =4000 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is z≈2.29, which would correspond to option C)2.4.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. I think the key point is whether the optical range is considered to start at 300 nm (which is near-UV) or 400 nm (visible). If the question is considering the optical as starting at 400 nm, then the lower limit is around 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4.

But if the question considers the optical to allow up to 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), then the lower limit is 1.47, and the correct answer would be D)1.9.

I'm more confident in the first approach, that the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms. So the minimal z is about 1.47, but since that's not an option, the next possible is D)1.9.

But wait, another approach: the quasar's light that we receive must have the Lyman alpha line in the optical part of the spectrum that the telescope can see. If the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line from intervening clouds would be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's redshift. For example, if the quasar is at z=3, the cloud at z=1.9 would have its Lyman alpha line at 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms (352.6 nm), which is near-UV, which can't be seen from the ground.

Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha line would be at a wavelength that is longer than the quasar's emission line. Hmm, maybe I should think about the quasar's emission line.

Wait, quasars emit light across the spectrum. The Lyman alpha emission line from the quasar itself would be at 1216 Angstroms*(1+z_quasar). But the intervening clouds absorb the quasar's light at their own z_cloud: 1216*(1+z_cloud).

So for the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range.

So again, the same condition applies: 1216*(1+z_cloud) >3000 Angstroms.

So minimal z_cloud is about 1.47.

But if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. So perhaps the quasar's z is such that when the cloud's Lyman alpha is redshifted to the optical, the quasar's own light is in the infrared.

But that might not directly affect the calculation of the cloud's minimal z.

Another consideration: what's the typical redshift for the Lyman-alpha forest? I recall that it's observed at z up to around 6 or more, but the question is about the lower limit.

But perhaps the correct approach is to consider the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range observable from the ground, which is above 3000 Angstroms.

So, 1216*(1+z) >=3000 → z >= (3000/1216)−1≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. The options don't have this, but the closest higher option is D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the formula for the Lyman-alpha forest, where the clouds are at a redshift higher than the quasar, but that doesn't make sense because the quasar is behind the clouds.

Wait, no. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the clouds. So when the quasar's light passes through a cloud at z_cloud, the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). So for the absorption line to be visible in the optical, (1+z_cloud) must be such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical.

So the minimal z_cloud is 1.47, as before.

Since the options don't include 1.47, perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the lower limit on the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's.

Wait, the question says: "estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?"

Wait, wait! The question says: "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars". So the object in question is the cloud, and its redshift. So I think the cloud's redshift is what we're calculating.

So, the cloud's z must be such that 1216*(1+z) >=3000 → z >=1.467.

So the options are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Since 1.467 is higher than B)1.2, the lower limit is z>1.467. So the minimal z is 1.467, which is higher than 1.2, meaning that B)1.2 is too low. So the answer must be D)1.9, as it's the next option higher than 1.467.

But wait, 1.9 is higher than 1.467, so any cloud at z=1.9 would satisfy the condition. But the question is about the lower limit, which would be the minimal z where it's detectable. So the minimal is 1.467, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9 as the minimal z in the options that satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different threshold for the optical. Like, perhaps 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) is considered the start of optical. Then, z= (4000/1216)-1≈2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, and the closest option is C)2.4.

I think I'm going in circles. To conclude, I think the correct approach is to use 3000 Angstroms as the threshold, leading to z=1.47, but since that's not an option, the intended correct answer is D)1.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we must consider the following:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The Lyman-alpha absorption line has a rest wavelength of 1216 Å.  
   - Optical ground-based telescopes cannot observe wavelengths shorter than approximately 3000 Å (300 nm) due to atmospheric absorption.  
   - The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is given by:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
     \]  
     where \( z \) is the redshift of the cloud.

2. **Threshold for Optical Detection**:  
   For the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), we solve for \( z \):  
   \[
   1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 3000.
   \]  
   Dividing through by 1216:  
   \[
   1 + z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467.
   \]  
   Subtracting 1:  
   \[
   z \geq 1.467.
   \]  
   Thus, the minimal redshift for the cloud is approximately \( z \approx 1.47 \).

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (3)**: This is much higher than the calculated lower limit of \( z \approx 1.47 \).  
   - **Option B (1.2)**: This is lower than the calculated lower limit, so it is too small to satisfy the condition.  
   - **Option C (2.4)**: This is higher than \( z \approx 1.47 \) and would satisfy the condition, but it is not the minimal redshift.  
   - **Option D (1.9)**: This is also higher than \( z \approx 1.47 \) and satisfies the condition.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The lower limit on the redshift is \( z \approx 1.47 \). Among the given options, the smallest value that satisfies this condition is **D (1.9)**. While \( z = 1.9 \) is not exact, it is the closest option provided and represents a valid redshift for detecting the Lyman-alpha line in the optical range.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this question about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and their detection using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because I think the ultraviolet is around 10-400 nm, and 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV.

But the question is about detecting them with optical telescopes. Oh, because the absorbed light would be redshifted. Right, because as the universe expands, the wavelength stretches. So the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) line from these clouds would be shifted into a longer wavelength, possibly into the optical range if the redshift is high enough.

Wait, the quasar's light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda is lambda_rest * (1 + z). So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical range, which I think is about 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So, we need lambda >= 4000 Angstroms (since that's the start of optical in some definitions). Let me check: 1 micrometer is near-infrared, so optical is below that. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

So lambda >= 4000 Angstroms. But lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

Let's solve for z.

Divide both sides by 1216: 1 + z >= 4000 / 1216.

Calculate that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So 1 + z ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

So to have the observed wavelength be at least 4000 Angstroms, the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is around 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 2.29 is closer to 2.3 which isn't an option. Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm being a bit hasty. Let me recalculate: 4000 /1216 = ?

Let me compute 1216 ×3.3 = 1216 ×3 = 3648, 1216 ×0.3=364.8 → 3648+364.8=4012.8. Oh, so 3.3 ×1216 =4012.8 Angstroms. Which is just over 4000. So z=2.3 would give lambda=4012.8 Angstroms, which is just into the optical.

But the question says "estimate the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So if the redshift is z=2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, which is the start of optical. But since instruments have finite resolution, perhaps the lower limit is higher.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just at the optical threshold.

So 4000 Angstroms is the lower end of optical. So the minimal z would be when lambda_obs is 4000. So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1=2.29. So approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than this, but D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, so the minimal z is about 2.3. So the answer would be the option just above that. But wait, the options don't have 2.3.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) because of atmospheric absorption in the UV. Oh, right! The atmosphere blocks a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) in the optical. So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms needs to be redshifted beyond 3000 Angstroms to be seen.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is at higher wavelengths because of redshift. The neutral hydrogen cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is in the quasar's spectrum. So when the cloud is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line is observed at longer wavelengths. Since the quasar itself must emit light that, after passing through the cloud, has its Lyman alpha line shifted into a wavelength that the telescope can see.

Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha line would be at an even longer wavelength. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light, which passes through the intergalactic medium, which has neutral hydrogen clouds. These clouds absorb the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) from the quasar's light. When we observe this, the absorption line is at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

But for this absorption line to be in the optical range that a ground-based telescope can detect, the observed wavelength must be longer than 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) because below that, the atmosphere absorbs it (like the ozone layer blocking UV).

So, for the absorption line to be in the optical (i.e., observed wavelength > 3000 Angstroms), the cloud's redshift z must satisfy:

1216 (1 + z) > 3000 Angstroms.

So let's compute that:

1 + z > 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467.

So z > 1.467.

Hmm, that's like z ≈1.47. But that's way lower than the previous calculation. Wait, but earlier I thought the optical starts at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Maybe I got the definition wrong. So it's 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) which is near UV but perhaps within the range that can be observed from the ground.

Wait, but wait. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216 (1 + z). To be in the optical, which for ground-based telescopes, the cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), because below that, Earth's atmosphere doesn't let the light through (it's absorbed by the atmosphere, particularly by ozone). So for the absorption line to be visible, it must be in the range that the atmosphere allows.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216 (1 + z) = 3000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 3000 /1216 ≈ 2.467.

So z ≈1.467.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.467, and option B is 1.2 which is lower. So the lower limit would be z ≈1.467, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is D)1.9.

Wait, but why would the lower limit be 1.9? Because the minimal z is around 1.47, so any z above that would be detectable. So the lower limit is 1.47, so the minimal redshift is about 1.47. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the wavelength threshold.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha forest, which is a series of absorption lines in quasar spectra from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts. These absorption lines are observed in the optical range because the quasars themselves are at high redshifts. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms rest frame, so when observed, it's shifted to longer wavelengths.

But for a ground-based telescope to detect it, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) to avoid atmospheric absorption. So 1216 (1 + z) > 3000.

So 1 + z > 3000/1216 ≈2.467 → z>1.467.

So any z above about 1.47 would allow the Lyman alpha absorption to be in the observed optical range. So the minimal z is around 1.47, but looking at the options, the closest one is D)1.9, but that's higher than 1.47.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the lower end of the optical spectrum as 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Let me recalculate with 4000.

So 1216*(1 + z) =4000 → 1 + z =4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit would be about 2.29, which is close to option C)2.4 and D)1.9. Hmm, 2.29 is between option C and D.

Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is closer to 2.4. So the lower limit would be that z is at least 2.29, so the minimal is 2.29. So the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is C)2.4. But I'm not sure because the options don't have an exact match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, which starts at about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So the calculation would give z≈2.29.

In that case, the minimal z is about 2.3. Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is the next higher. So the correct answer would be C)2.4.

But wait, why would the lower limit be higher than 2.3? Maybe because the atmosphere also absorbs some of the longer wavelengths, but I don't think so. Or perhaps the quasar's own emission is redshifted into the optical, and the Lyman alpha absorption is at longer wavelengths.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) in the rest frame of the cloud. For this to be observed in the optical range (say, 4000 Angstroms or higher), the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

So solving for z:

z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is ~2.29. So the lowest redshift possible to enter the optical is about that. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.3. Among the options, only C is above that, so option C (2.4) is the answer.

Wait, but why is option D 1.9? Because if the redshift is 1.9, then 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms. 3526.4 is 352.6 nm, which is in the UV and would be absorbed by the atmosphere, making it undetectable by ground-based telescopes. So the observed wavelength must be beyond 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), but maybe for practical purposes, the lower limit is higher.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. On one hand, if the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) to be seen from the ground, then the minimal z is about 1.467, which would make option D (1.9) a possible answer. But if the optical is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then the minimal z is about 2.29, which would make option C the correct answer.

I think I need to clarify what wavelength range defines the optical for ground-based telescopes. From what I remember, Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (far UV). So any observed wavelength longer than that (i.e., redshifted beyond that) would be in the optical range. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =3000 → z≈ (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.467-1=1.467.

So any z higher than ~1.467 would make the Lyman alpha line observable from the ground. So the lower limit is z=1.467.

Looking at the options, the choices are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Wait, 1.467 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the minimal redshift is about 1.47, so the lower limit would be just above that. But none of the options exactly match. So the options don't have 1.47. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman-alpha line being in the visible spectrum (say, 500 nm or 5000 Angstroms) for detection. Let's recalculate:

lambda =1216*(1+z) =5000 → 1+z=5000/1216≈4.098 → z≈3.098. So that's above option A (3). But option A is 3, which would be higher than 3.098, so that's not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the standard Lyman-alpha forest. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelength) of the quasar's emission lines. These absorption lines are due to neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts along the line of sight. The Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical range when the cloud's redshift brings it into that range.

So for a ground-based telescope, the Lyman alpha line must be observed at wavelengths above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), as shorter wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z) =3000 → z≈1.467.

So any cloud with z>1.467 would have its Lyman alpha line in the optical range detectable from the ground.

Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the lower limit is about 1.47. So the minimal z is 1.47. The options have D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47. So that would allow the Lyman alpha line to be observed.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47, so any z >=1.47 can be detected. The question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z is 1.47. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the quasar's redshift. If the quasar itself is at a certain redshift, then the clouds in front of it would have to be at a higher redshift than the quasar. Wait, no. Quasars are typically very bright and at high redshifts. The Lyman alpha forest clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasars. Wait, no, that's not correct. The quasar's light comes from behind the clouds, so the clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasar. Or perhaps higher? Wait, no. The quasar is at a high redshift, and the clouds are at various lower redshifts along the line of sight. Because the quasar's light passes through material that is closer to us (lower redshifts) than the quasar itself.

Wait, no. Let me think: when we look at a quasar, which is at a high redshift (like z=2 or higher), the light passes through intergalactic clouds that are at various redshifts between us and the quasar. So the clouds are at lower redshifts than the quasar.

Wait, but if the quasar is at redshift z_q, then the clouds are at z_cloud < z_q.

But in this case, the question is about the clouds being detected. So the cloud's Lyman alpha line must be in the optical range. So for the cloud's z to satisfy 1216*(1+z_cloud) > 3000 Angstroms.

So z_cloud > (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z_cloud is about 1.47.

But in the options, the closest higher value is D)1.9, which is 1.9. So the lower limit is z_cloud ≈1.47, but the question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So any z_cloud >=1.47 would be detectable, meaning that the lower limit is z=1.47.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is D)1.9, assuming that the question expects the Lyman alpha to be in the visible spectrum (400 nm) and thus the redshift is about 2.29.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's own emission being in the optical, which would require a higher redshift, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The question is to find the minimal z such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical. So ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) because the atmosphere blocks it. Hence, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 Angstroms.

So the minimal z is when 1216(1+z) =3000 → z= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. So the lower limit is z>1.47.

Looking at the options, D is 1.9, which is above 1.47, so any cloud with z=1.9 would have the Lyman alpha line in the detectable range. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal possible z is 1.47, so any z above that can be detected. So the lower limit is z=1.47, but that's not an option. So the question might be expecting that the Lyman alpha line must be in the visible range (400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), which would require higher z.

Wait, but 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is near UV. But perhaps the question considers optical to start at 400 nm. So let's redo:

1216 (1+z) =4000 → z= (4000/1216)-1 ≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. The option closest to that is C)2.4.

So the correct answer would be C)2.4.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the atmosphere allows some UV to pass. Like, for example, the HST can observe in UV, but ground-based can't. So perhaps the correct approach is considering that the minimal z is when the wavelength is just beyond what the atmosphere allows, which is 3000 Angstroms (300 nm). That would be z≈1.47.

But the options don't have that. So the available options are B)1.2 (which is lower than 1.47) and D)1.9. So if the minimal z is 1.47, then any cloud with z>1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D)1.9 because it's the smallest option above 1.47.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha line being redshifted into the visible spectrum (400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), which would require a higher z, around 2.3.

So considering the options, the answer would be C)2.4.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another point to consider: the Lyman-alpha absorption line is at 121.6 nm. To be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted to longer wavelengths. For a ground-based telescope, the maximum wavelength that can be observed is about 300 nm, but wait, no. Wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) because of atmospheric absorption. So wavelengths longer than 300 nm (like 350 nm, 400 nm) are in the near-UV and visible range, respectively.

So for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical (i.e., in the range that can pass through the atmosphere), it must be redshifted to wavelengths longer than 300 nm. So:

1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) > 3000 Angstroms → z > (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47, meaning that with z=1.9, the line is in the optical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be in the visible range (say, above 400 nm), which would require higher redshift.

So recalculate:

1216*(1 + z) =4000 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is z≈2.29, which would correspond to option C)2.4.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. I think the key point is whether the optical range is considered to start at 300 nm (which is near-UV) or 400 nm (visible). If the question is considering the optical as starting at 400 nm, then the lower limit is around 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4.

But if the question considers the optical to allow up to 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), then the lower limit is 1.47, and the correct answer would be D)1.9.

I'm more confident in the first approach, that the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms. So the minimal z is about 1.47, but since that's not an option, the next possible is D)1.9.

But wait, another approach: the quasar's light that we receive must have the Lyman alpha line in the optical part of the spectrum that the telescope can see. If the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line from intervening clouds would be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's redshift. For example, if the quasar is at z=3, the cloud at z=1.9 would have its Lyman alpha line at 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms (352.6 nm), which is near-UV, which can't be seen from the ground.

Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha line would be at a wavelength that is longer than the quasar's emission line. Hmm, maybe I should think about the quasar's emission line.

Wait, quasars emit light across the spectrum. The Lyman alpha emission line from the quasar itself would be at 1216 Angstroms*(1+z_quasar). But the intervening clouds absorb the quasar's light at their own z_cloud: 1216*(1+z_cloud).

So for the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range.

So again, the same condition applies: 1216*(1+z_cloud) >3000 Angstroms.

So minimal z_cloud is about 1.47.

But if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. So perhaps the quasar's z is such that when the cloud's Lyman alpha is redshifted to the optical, the quasar's own light is in the infrared.

But that might not directly affect the calculation of the cloud's minimal z.

Another consideration: what's the typical redshift for the Lyman-alpha forest? I recall that it's observed at z up to around 6 or more, but the question is about the lower limit.

But perhaps the correct approach is to consider the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range observable from the ground, which is above 3000 Angstroms.

So, 1216*(1+z) >=3000 → z >= (3000/1216)−1≈1.467.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. The options don't have this, but the closest higher option is D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the formula for the Lyman-alpha forest, where the clouds are at a redshift higher than the quasar, but that doesn't make sense because the quasar is behind the clouds.

Wait, no. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the clouds. So when the quasar's light passes through a cloud at z_cloud, the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). So for the absorption line to be visible in the optical, (1+z_cloud) must be such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical.

So the minimal z_cloud is 1.47, as before.

Since the options don't include 1.47, perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the lower limit on the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's.

Wait, the question says: "estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?"

Wait, wait! The question says: "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars". So the object in question is the cloud, and its redshift. So I think the cloud's redshift is what we're calculating.

So, the cloud's z must be such that 1216*(1+z) >=3000 → z >=1.467.

So the options are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Since 1.467 is higher than B)1.2, the lower limit is z>1.467. So the minimal z is 1.467, which is higher than 1.2, meaning that B)1.2 is too low. So the answer must be D)1.9, as it's the next option higher than 1.467.

But wait, 1.9 is higher than 1.467, so any cloud at z=1.9 would satisfy the condition. But the question is about the lower limit, which would be the minimal z where it's detectable. So the minimal is 1.467, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is D)1.9 as the minimal z in the options that satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different threshold for the optical. Like, perhaps 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) is considered the start of optical. Then, z= (4000/1216)-1≈2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, and the closest option is C)2.4.

I think I'm going in circles. To conclude, I think the correct approach is to use 3000 Angstroms as the threshold, leading to z=1.47, but since that's not an option, the intended correct answer is D)1.9.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we must consider the following:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The Lyman-alpha absorption line has a rest wavelength of 1216 Å.  
   - Optical ground-based telescopes cannot observe wavelengths shorter than approximately 3000 Å (300 nm) due to atmospheric absorption.  
   - The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is given by:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
     \]  
     where \( z \) is the redshift of the cloud.

2. **Threshold for Optical Detection**:  
   For the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), we solve for \( z \):  
   \[
   1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 3000.
   \]  
   Dividing through by 1216:  
   \[
   1 + z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467.
   \]  
   Subtracting 1:  
   \[
   z \geq 1.467.
   \]  
   Thus, the minimal redshift for the cloud is approximately \( z \approx 1.47 \).

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (3)**: This is much higher than the calculated lower limit of \( z \approx 1.47 \).  
   - **Option B (1.2)**: This is lower than the calculated lower limit, so it is too small to satisfy the condition.  
   - **Option C (2.4)**: This is higher than \( z \approx 1.47 \) and would satisfy the condition, but it is not the minimal redshift.  
   - **Option D (1.9)**: This is also higher than \( z \approx 1.47 \) and satisfies the condition.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The lower limit on the redshift is \( z \approx 1.47 \). Among the given options, the smallest value that satisfies this condition is **D (1.9)**. While \( z = 1.9 \) is not exact, it is the closest option provided and represents a valid redshift for detecting the Lyman-alpha line in the optical range.

**Answer: D**
