Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns, both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide structure.

Wait, so for each starting material, an epoxide is formed. Let's think about each reaction step by step.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. The E isomer has the two substituents (the groups on each end of the double bond) opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the epoxide formation leads to a trans configuration in the epoxide ring. Wait, no, wait—epoxidation of a trans double bond (E) would give an epoxide with the substituents on adjacent carbons being trans. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two methyl groups (assuming oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3? Let me get that right. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, that's not right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, octene is eight carbons. So positions 4 and 5 are double bond. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, no. Let me think again: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The exact structure might not matter right now, but the key is that the double bond is in position 4.

Anyway, when you have an E and Z isomer of the same double bond, and you treat each with mCPBA, you form epoxides. The key point is whether the epoxide can open in a way that leads to different products, or maybe different diastereomers.

Wait, after epoxidation, when treated with aqueous acid, what happens? Oh, right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then, a nucleophile (like water) attacks. In acid conditions, the nucleophile is water.

So, for each epoxide, when you treat with aqueous acid, the ring opens. The ring opening can lead to different products depending on the structure of the epoxide and the conditions.

Wait, but for each starting alkene (E and Z), the epoxide formed will have a certain stereochemistry. Let me think about (E)-oct-4-ene first. When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide forms with the trans configuration because the reaction is stereospecific. So the substituents on the epoxide will be on opposite sides.

Wait, when a trans (E) double bond forms an epoxide, the resulting epoxide has the two substituents (the groups from each end of the double bond) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the substituents (like the CH2 groups) trans to each other.

Now, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring will open. The ring opening can proceed via a partial mechanism where the most substituted carbocation is formed, or maybe via some other pathway. Wait, in acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized. Wait, no, actually, in acid, the ring opens when a water molecule attacks the less substituted carbon because the epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me recall: the epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions typically leads to the nucleophile attacking the more substituted carbon because it can better stabilize the transition state (or the carbocation, if that's the mechanism). Or wait, perhaps it's a two-step process: protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons positively polarized. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when it forms a carbocation. But wait, in epoxide ring-opening, the mechanism is a concerted process, so maybe it's more about which carbon is more electrophilic.

Wait, another thought: for an epoxide derived from a trans double bond, the ring opening in acid may lead to different products than if the starting alkene is cis. So when the epoxide is formed from (E) isomer, the substituents are trans, so when the epoxide ring opens, what happens? Let me think about the structure.

Suppose the epoxide is trans, so when it opens, the attack can occur on either side, leading to different diastereomers or maybe the same product. Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to a single diastereomer upon ring opening.

Wait, but the exact products are probably a pair of diastereomers. Let me think: when you have an epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans epoxide. Then, upon treatment with acid, it opens. The ring opening can happen in two different ways, leading to two different diastereomers.

Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to a single product upon ring opening because the ring is symmetric. Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond because it's in the middle. So the epoxide would be symmetric, meaning that the ring opening would lead to the same product regardless of which side the attack occurs on. Hmm, that might be the case.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound, perhaps. So when it forms an epoxide, the epoxide is also symmetric. Therefore, when it rings open under acidic conditions, it would form a single product.

Wait, but let's think about the ring opening. For a symmetric epoxide, like the one from (E)-oct-4-ene, the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product because the molecule is symmetric. So the product would be a single diol.

Wait, but wait, no. The diol's configuration would depend on how the epoxide opens. For a symmetric epoxide, like that formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol formed would have both stereocenters in a certain configuration. But since the epoxide is symmetric, attacking either side would give the same product. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, or maybe even a single enantiomer? Wait, no, because the molecule could be meso.

Wait, let me think again. If the epoxide is symmetric, then during ring opening, the attack could happen equally on either carbon, but the resulting diol could have two stereocenters. But due to symmetry, these stereocenters would be in a configuration that makes the molecule meso. So the diol would be a meso compound. Therefore, it would have two stereocenters but be achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. So the diol from the (E)-epoxide would be a single, achiral molecule.

Now, what about the (Z)-oct-4-ene? Its epoxide would be formed from a cis double bond. So, the substituents on the epoxide would be cis. Now, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

Again, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring opening would still happen on either carbon. But wait, the epoxide from (Z) isomer is not necessarily symmetric in the same way. Wait, no, because (Z)-oct-4-ene is symmetric as well. So the epoxide would also be symmetric. So, perhaps for both E and Z starting materials, the epoxide is symmetric, leading to a single diol each, but each with different configurations.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkenes are E and Z, but the epoxide from E is trans and from Z is cis. When each is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. For the (E)-epoxide (trans), the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same face because the ring opening would add them in a way that's opposite to the epoxide substituents. Or wait, maybe the diastereomer formed depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the trans epoxide leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides, but given the symmetry, it forms a meso compound. Similarly, the cis epoxide would lead to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side, but again, due to symmetry, it might also be a meso compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Let's say the epoxide is trans. So, the two substituents (like CH2CH2CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. When it opens in acid, the attack of water can occur from either face. But because the molecule is symmetric, the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans), but due to symmetry, it would result in a meso compound either way.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the epoxide structure. Let's say the epoxide is between carbons 4 and 5 of octene. So the structure is C-O-C, with each C connected to two CH2 groups on either side. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. When the epoxide opens, each CH2 group is attached to an oxygen. So when the ring opens, each CH2-O becomes a CH-OH group, but the positions of the hydroxyl groups would depend on where the attack occurs.

Wait, perhaps in the case of (E) epoxide, the attack occurs from the same face, leading to the two hydroxyl groups being on the same side of the original double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it leads to trans diol because the substituents were trans in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe an example would help. Suppose we have ethylene oxide (a simple epoxide). If you open it with acid, you get a diol. But in more complex structures, the configuration depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible products. Let's think about each reaction:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → ring opens in acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → ring opens in acid → diol.

Now, for each reaction, how many stereoisomers are formed?

In Reaction 1, the (E) epoxide is symmetric. When it opens, the diol's stereochemistry will depend on the attack direction. Because the molecule is symmetric, the attack on either side would lead to the same product. So the product is a single diastereomer. But wait, is that diastereomer a meso compound? If so, it's achiral. So Reaction 1 gives a single product, which is a meso diol.

Reaction 2: the (Z) epoxide is also symmetric. So when it opens, the same reasoning applies. But wait, the epoxide is cis, so when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups may end up on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, perhaps for the (E) epoxide, the diol has the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces (trans), and for the (Z) epoxide, the hydroxyls are on the same face (cis). But wait, no. Let me think again.

When the epoxide oxygen is protonated, the ring opens with the nucleophile (water) attacking the more substituted carbon. Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxide, each carbon is equally substituted, so the attack can occur on either carbon.

But perhaps in the case of the (E) epoxide, the attack leads to a trans diol, while for the (Z) epoxide, the attack leads to a cis diol. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the epoxide's substituents would affect the approach of water.

Wait, another approach: The reaction with mCPBA adds an epoxide across the double bond in a syn addition. So, for a trans (E) double bond, the addition of the oxygen occurs on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide. Then, when the epoxide opens, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opening leads to the diol with the same stereochemistry as the epoxide. So, a trans epoxide would form a trans diol, and a cis epoxide would form a cis diol.

Wait, let me think of an example. If I have (E)-2-butene reacting with mCPBA, the epoxide formed would have the substituents on opposite sides. Then, when treated with acid, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side if the epoxide was trans. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a general rule.

In general, the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide can lead to the formation of a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the stereochemistry of the epoxide and the mechanism of ring opening.

For a trans epoxide (from E double bond), the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face (cis) because the attack occurs from the same face. Wait, no, the attack could be from either side, but given the trans arrangement, perhaps the diol ends up with the hydroxyls on the same face.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when the epoxide is formed from a trans double bond (E), the two substituents on the epoxide are trans. When the epoxide opens in acid, the nucleophile (water) can attack either carbon. Each attack would lead to a different diastereomer. But due to the symmetry of the epoxide, both attacks would yield the same product, a meso diol.

Similarly, for the cis epoxide (from Z double bond), the attack can occur in a way that produces a diol with two chiral centers, and due to the symmetry, it might also result in a meso compound.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce meso diols, each being a single, achiral product. So, the products from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are two different diastereomeric meso compounds.

Wait, but no. Wait, if both epoxides are symmetric and each ring opening leads to a single meso diol, then the products from each reaction are single compounds. So in Reaction 1, you get one product (meso diol from E epoxide), and in Reaction 2, another product (meso diol from Z epoxide). Are these two products the same or different?

Wait, no, because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxides are different, and thus the resulting diols are different. So Reaction 1 gives a diol that's a meso compound, and Reaction 2 gives another diol that's also a meso compound but different.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide is symmetric in both E and Z forms. Therefore, when each is treated with mCPBA, the resulting epoxides are both meso compounds. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the diols formed are also meso compounds. So each reaction gives a single, achiral product.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans double bond in the middle of the molecule. Its epoxide is a trans epoxide, which is a meso compound because of the symmetry. Then, when it opens, the diol would also be a meso compound. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis double bond, leading to a cis epoxide, which is also a meso compound due to the symmetry. Therefore, when each is treated with acid, each gives a diol that's a meso compound.

So each reaction produces a single product, which is a meso diol. Now, the two meso diols are different because the starting materials were different. So, in the product mixture, there are two different diols.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: Reaction 1 gives one diol (from E), and Reaction 2 gives another diol (from Z). Are these two diols enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same compound?

No, because the starting alkenes are different, the diols should be different. Wait, but considering the symmetry, maybe the diols are the same? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me imagine the structures.

Suppose (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3 (but correctly, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5). When epoxidized, the E isomer would form an epoxide where the substituents (like the CH2CH2CH2 groups on C4 and C5) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Then, upon acid treatment, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face, but due to the symmetry, it would be a meso compound.

Similarly, the Z epoxide would form from a cis double bond, leading to substituents on the same side of the epoxide ring. Upon opening, the diol would have hydroxyls on the same face, but again due to symmetry, it's a meso compound.

Wait, but the diols from E and Z epoxides might have different configurations. For example, the E diol could be a meso compound where the hydroxyls are on the same face, while the Z diol is another meso compound where the hydroxyls are on the same face but a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the diols from E and Z are actually the same compound because of the symmetry. No, that can't be right. Because the starting alkenes are different, the diols should be different. So, the products of the two reactions are two different diols. Each is a meso compound, so each is achiral.

Wait, but if each product is a single, achiral molecule, then when they're combined, you have two different, achiral compounds. So when you run them on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, each would elute as a single peak because they're separate compounds. So you'd see two peaks: one for each diol. But wait, each diol is itself a single compound, so each would give a peak.

But wait, each diol is a meso compound, so they are achiral. So when run on a standard HPLC column, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, each diol would elute as a single peak. So the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

Now, when run on a chiral HPLC column, which can separate enantiomers, what happens? Since each diol is a meso compound, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, a chiral HPLC column wouldn't separate them; each would still elute as a single peak. So, the chiral column would also show two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the diols are not meso compounds. Maybe each diol has two stereocenters and is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, for a molecule to be meso, it must have stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry. If the diols from E and Z are each achiral (meso), then their chiral HPLC wouldn't separate them; each would give a single peak.

Alternatively, if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would see them as a single peak (since it's achiral), but the chiral HPLC would split each into two peaks. But in this problem, the products from each reaction are 100% conversion, so each is a single diastereomer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the diols.

For (E)-oct-4-ene:

Epoxide structure: C-O-C, with substituents (CH2CH2CH2-) on opposite sides.

Upon ring opening, the diol would have hydroxyl groups on the same side of each carbon.

Wait, more accurately, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons in a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene would have a trans configuration between the hydroxyls, while the diol from (Z) would have a cis configuration.

Wait, that's possible. Because the E epoxide would lead to a trans diol, and the Z would lead to a cis diol.

But wait, considering the symmetry, for (E) epoxide, the diol would be a meso compound. For (Z), perhaps it's also a meso compound but with a different configuration.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the possible products.

Assuming that each reaction gives a single diol product, which is a meso compound, then each product is a single, achiral compound. So when you combine both products, you have two different, achiral diols.

When you run them on a standard HPLC, which doesn't discriminate between enantiomers, each diol would give a single peak. So the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

When run on a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since each diol is achiral, each would give a single peak. So the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: the starting alkenes are E and Z. Each gives a different epoxide. Each epoxide, when treated with acid, gives a diol. Each diol is a meso compound (achiral). So the products are two different diols, each achiral.

So when the products are combined, they have two different diols. On standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each would elute as a single peak as well, so two peaks. So the answer would be 2 peaks in both HPLC columns.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 2 peaks in both. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could the diols themselves be enantiomers, making them chiral and thus showing different peaks on chiral HPLC?

Wait, no. Because each diol is a meso compound, they are achiral. So the chiral HPLC won't separate them. Each diol would still give a single peak.

But wait, perhaps the diols from E and Z are not meso. Maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but in a racemic form. Wait, but in the problem statement, each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each would form a single enantiomer, or a single diastereomer.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

When (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, you get a trans epoxide. Then, acid treatment leads to a diol. The attack of water would lead to two possible diastereomers, but due to the symmetry, they might form a single meso compound.

Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would form a cis diol, which is also a meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, for (E) epoxide, the diol would have the hydroxyls on the same face, but due to the symmetry, it's meso. Similarly, for (Z) epoxide, the diol would have hydroxyls on the same face, but maybe a different configuration, but due to symmetry, it's also meso.

Wait, but if the diol from (E) is meso and the diol from (Z) is also meso, but different compounds, then each would have a single peak.

So, in the combined product, you have two different diols, each a meso compound. When run on an achiral column, each would produce a single peak. So two peaks. On a chiral column, each would still be a single peak (since they're achiral), so again two peaks.

So the correct option should be C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Looking at the options:

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Yes, that makes sense.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the resulting products are analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA is a stereospecific oxidizing agent that forms epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a trans configuration, while for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a cis configuration.
   - Acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxides leads to the formation of diols. The stereochemistry of the diols depends on the stereochemistry of the starting epoxides.

2. **Epoxide to Diol Conversion**:
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the trans epoxide forms a meso diol upon ring opening. This diol has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the cis epoxide also forms a meso diol upon ring opening. This diol is also achiral for the same reason.

3. **Products**:
   - Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso diol from the (E)-oct-4-ene.
   - Reaction 2 produces a single, achiral meso diol from the (Z)-oct-4-ene.
   - The two diols are structurally distinct and do not interconvert.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Since both diols are achiral, they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, but since both diols are achiral (meso compounds), they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the chiral HPLC will also show **2 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in both the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns, both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide structure.

Wait, so for each starting material, an epoxide is formed. Let's think about each reaction step by step.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. The E isomer has the two substituents (the groups on each end of the double bond) opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the epoxide formation leads to a trans configuration in the epoxide ring. Wait, no, wait—epoxidation of a trans double bond (E) would give an epoxide with the substituents on adjacent carbons being trans. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two methyl groups (assuming oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3? Let me get that right. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, that's not right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, octene is eight carbons. So positions 4 and 5 are double bond. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, no. Let me think again: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The exact structure might not matter right now, but the key is that the double bond is in position 4.

Anyway, when you have an E and Z isomer of the same double bond, and you treat each with mCPBA, you form epoxides. The key point is whether the epoxide can open in a way that leads to different products, or maybe different diastereomers.

Wait, after epoxidation, when treated with aqueous acid, what happens? Oh, right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then, a nucleophile (like water) attacks. In acid conditions, the nucleophile is water.

So, for each epoxide, when you treat with aqueous acid, the ring opens. The ring opening can lead to different products depending on the structure of the epoxide and the conditions.

Wait, but for each starting alkene (E and Z), the epoxide formed will have a certain stereochemistry. Let me think about (E)-oct-4-ene first. When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide forms with the trans configuration because the reaction is stereospecific. So the substituents on the epoxide will be on opposite sides.

Wait, when a trans (E) double bond forms an epoxide, the resulting epoxide has the two substituents (the groups from each end of the double bond) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the substituents (like the CH2 groups) trans to each other.

Now, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring will open. The ring opening can proceed via a partial mechanism where the most substituted carbocation is formed, or maybe via some other pathway. Wait, in acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized. Wait, no, actually, in acid, the ring opens when a water molecule attacks the less substituted carbon because the epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me recall: the epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions typically leads to the nucleophile attacking the more substituted carbon because it can better stabilize the transition state (or the carbocation, if that's the mechanism). Or wait, perhaps it's a two-step process: protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons positively polarized. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when it forms a carbocation. But wait, in epoxide ring-opening, the mechanism is a concerted process, so maybe it's more about which carbon is more electrophilic.

Wait, another thought: for an epoxide derived from a trans double bond, the ring opening in acid may lead to different products than if the starting alkene is cis. So when the epoxide is formed from (E) isomer, the substituents are trans, so when the epoxide ring opens, what happens? Let me think about the structure.

Suppose the epoxide is trans, so when it opens, the attack can occur on either side, leading to different diastereomers or maybe the same product. Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to a single diastereomer upon ring opening.

Wait, but the exact products are probably a pair of diastereomers. Let me think: when you have an epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans epoxide. Then, upon treatment with acid, it opens. The ring opening can happen in two different ways, leading to two different diastereomers.

Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to a single product upon ring opening because the ring is symmetric. Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond because it's in the middle. So the epoxide would be symmetric, meaning that the ring opening would lead to the same product regardless of which side the attack occurs on. Hmm, that might be the case.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound, perhaps. So when it forms an epoxide, the epoxide is also symmetric. Therefore, when it rings open under acidic conditions, it would form a single product.

Wait, but let's think about the ring opening. For a symmetric epoxide, like the one from (E)-oct-4-ene, the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product because the molecule is symmetric. So the product would be a single diol.

Wait, but wait, no. The diol's configuration would depend on how the epoxide opens. For a symmetric epoxide, like that formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol formed would have both stereocenters in a certain configuration. But since the epoxide is symmetric, attacking either side would give the same product. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, or maybe even a single enantiomer? Wait, no, because the molecule could be meso.

Wait, let me think again. If the epoxide is symmetric, then during ring opening, the attack could happen equally on either carbon, but the resulting diol could have two stereocenters. But due to symmetry, these stereocenters would be in a configuration that makes the molecule meso. So the diol would be a meso compound. Therefore, it would have two stereocenters but be achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. So the diol from the (E)-epoxide would be a single, achiral molecule.

Now, what about the (Z)-oct-4-ene? Its epoxide would be formed from a cis double bond. So, the substituents on the epoxide would be cis. Now, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

Again, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring opening would still happen on either carbon. But wait, the epoxide from (Z) isomer is not necessarily symmetric in the same way. Wait, no, because (Z)-oct-4-ene is symmetric as well. So the epoxide would also be symmetric. So, perhaps for both E and Z starting materials, the epoxide is symmetric, leading to a single diol each, but each with different configurations.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkenes are E and Z, but the epoxide from E is trans and from Z is cis. When each is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. For the (E)-epoxide (trans), the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same face because the ring opening would add them in a way that's opposite to the epoxide substituents. Or wait, maybe the diastereomer formed depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the trans epoxide leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides, but given the symmetry, it forms a meso compound. Similarly, the cis epoxide would lead to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side, but again, due to symmetry, it might also be a meso compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Let's say the epoxide is trans. So, the two substituents (like CH2CH2CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. When it opens in acid, the attack of water can occur from either face. But because the molecule is symmetric, the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans), but due to symmetry, it would result in a meso compound either way.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the epoxide structure. Let's say the epoxide is between carbons 4 and 5 of octene. So the structure is C-O-C, with each C connected to two CH2 groups on either side. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. When the epoxide opens, each CH2 group is attached to an oxygen. So when the ring opens, each CH2-O becomes a CH-OH group, but the positions of the hydroxyl groups would depend on where the attack occurs.

Wait, perhaps in the case of (E) epoxide, the attack occurs from the same face, leading to the two hydroxyl groups being on the same side of the original double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it leads to trans diol because the substituents were trans in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe an example would help. Suppose we have ethylene oxide (a simple epoxide). If you open it with acid, you get a diol. But in more complex structures, the configuration depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible products. Let's think about each reaction:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → ring opens in acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → ring opens in acid → diol.

Now, for each reaction, how many stereoisomers are formed?

In Reaction 1, the (E) epoxide is symmetric. When it opens, the diol's stereochemistry will depend on the attack direction. Because the molecule is symmetric, the attack on either side would lead to the same product. So the product is a single diastereomer. But wait, is that diastereomer a meso compound? If so, it's achiral. So Reaction 1 gives a single product, which is a meso diol.

Reaction 2: the (Z) epoxide is also symmetric. So when it opens, the same reasoning applies. But wait, the epoxide is cis, so when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups may end up on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, perhaps for the (E) epoxide, the diol has the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces (trans), and for the (Z) epoxide, the hydroxyls are on the same face (cis). But wait, no. Let me think again.

When the epoxide oxygen is protonated, the ring opens with the nucleophile (water) attacking the more substituted carbon. Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxide, each carbon is equally substituted, so the attack can occur on either carbon.

But perhaps in the case of the (E) epoxide, the attack leads to a trans diol, while for the (Z) epoxide, the attack leads to a cis diol. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the epoxide's substituents would affect the approach of water.

Wait, another approach: The reaction with mCPBA adds an epoxide across the double bond in a syn addition. So, for a trans (E) double bond, the addition of the oxygen occurs on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide. Then, when the epoxide opens, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opening leads to the diol with the same stereochemistry as the epoxide. So, a trans epoxide would form a trans diol, and a cis epoxide would form a cis diol.

Wait, let me think of an example. If I have (E)-2-butene reacting with mCPBA, the epoxide formed would have the substituents on opposite sides. Then, when treated with acid, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side if the epoxide was trans. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a general rule.

In general, the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide can lead to the formation of a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the stereochemistry of the epoxide and the mechanism of ring opening.

For a trans epoxide (from E double bond), the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face (cis) because the attack occurs from the same face. Wait, no, the attack could be from either side, but given the trans arrangement, perhaps the diol ends up with the hydroxyls on the same face.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when the epoxide is formed from a trans double bond (E), the two substituents on the epoxide are trans. When the epoxide opens in acid, the nucleophile (water) can attack either carbon. Each attack would lead to a different diastereomer. But due to the symmetry of the epoxide, both attacks would yield the same product, a meso diol.

Similarly, for the cis epoxide (from Z double bond), the attack can occur in a way that produces a diol with two chiral centers, and due to the symmetry, it might also result in a meso compound.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce meso diols, each being a single, achiral product. So, the products from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are two different diastereomeric meso compounds.

Wait, but no. Wait, if both epoxides are symmetric and each ring opening leads to a single meso diol, then the products from each reaction are single compounds. So in Reaction 1, you get one product (meso diol from E epoxide), and in Reaction 2, another product (meso diol from Z epoxide). Are these two products the same or different?

Wait, no, because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxides are different, and thus the resulting diols are different. So Reaction 1 gives a diol that's a meso compound, and Reaction 2 gives another diol that's also a meso compound but different.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide is symmetric in both E and Z forms. Therefore, when each is treated with mCPBA, the resulting epoxides are both meso compounds. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the diols formed are also meso compounds. So each reaction gives a single, achiral product.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans double bond in the middle of the molecule. Its epoxide is a trans epoxide, which is a meso compound because of the symmetry. Then, when it opens, the diol would also be a meso compound. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis double bond, leading to a cis epoxide, which is also a meso compound due to the symmetry. Therefore, when each is treated with acid, each gives a diol that's a meso compound.

So each reaction produces a single product, which is a meso diol. Now, the two meso diols are different because the starting materials were different. So, in the product mixture, there are two different diols.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: Reaction 1 gives one diol (from E), and Reaction 2 gives another diol (from Z). Are these two diols enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same compound?

No, because the starting alkenes are different, the diols should be different. Wait, but considering the symmetry, maybe the diols are the same? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me imagine the structures.

Suppose (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3 (but correctly, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5). When epoxidized, the E isomer would form an epoxide where the substituents (like the CH2CH2CH2 groups on C4 and C5) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Then, upon acid treatment, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face, but due to the symmetry, it would be a meso compound.

Similarly, the Z epoxide would form from a cis double bond, leading to substituents on the same side of the epoxide ring. Upon opening, the diol would have hydroxyls on the same face, but again due to symmetry, it's a meso compound.

Wait, but the diols from E and Z epoxides might have different configurations. For example, the E diol could be a meso compound where the hydroxyls are on the same face, while the Z diol is another meso compound where the hydroxyls are on the same face but a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the diols from E and Z are actually the same compound because of the symmetry. No, that can't be right. Because the starting alkenes are different, the diols should be different. So, the products of the two reactions are two different diols. Each is a meso compound, so each is achiral.

Wait, but if each product is a single, achiral molecule, then when they're combined, you have two different, achiral compounds. So when you run them on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, each would elute as a single peak because they're separate compounds. So you'd see two peaks: one for each diol. But wait, each diol is itself a single compound, so each would give a peak.

But wait, each diol is a meso compound, so they are achiral. So when run on a standard HPLC column, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, each diol would elute as a single peak. So the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

Now, when run on a chiral HPLC column, which can separate enantiomers, what happens? Since each diol is a meso compound, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, a chiral HPLC column wouldn't separate them; each would still elute as a single peak. So, the chiral column would also show two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the diols are not meso compounds. Maybe each diol has two stereocenters and is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, for a molecule to be meso, it must have stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry. If the diols from E and Z are each achiral (meso), then their chiral HPLC wouldn't separate them; each would give a single peak.

Alternatively, if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would see them as a single peak (since it's achiral), but the chiral HPLC would split each into two peaks. But in this problem, the products from each reaction are 100% conversion, so each is a single diastereomer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the diols.

For (E)-oct-4-ene:

Epoxide structure: C-O-C, with substituents (CH2CH2CH2-) on opposite sides.

Upon ring opening, the diol would have hydroxyl groups on the same side of each carbon.

Wait, more accurately, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons in a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene would have a trans configuration between the hydroxyls, while the diol from (Z) would have a cis configuration.

Wait, that's possible. Because the E epoxide would lead to a trans diol, and the Z would lead to a cis diol.

But wait, considering the symmetry, for (E) epoxide, the diol would be a meso compound. For (Z), perhaps it's also a meso compound but with a different configuration.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the possible products.

Assuming that each reaction gives a single diol product, which is a meso compound, then each product is a single, achiral compound. So when you combine both products, you have two different, achiral diols.

When you run them on a standard HPLC, which doesn't discriminate between enantiomers, each diol would give a single peak. So the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

When run on a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since each diol is achiral, each would give a single peak. So the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: the starting alkenes are E and Z. Each gives a different epoxide. Each epoxide, when treated with acid, gives a diol. Each diol is a meso compound (achiral). So the products are two different diols, each achiral.

So when the products are combined, they have two different diols. On standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each would elute as a single peak as well, so two peaks. So the answer would be 2 peaks in both HPLC columns.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 2 peaks in both. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could the diols themselves be enantiomers, making them chiral and thus showing different peaks on chiral HPLC?

Wait, no. Because each diol is a meso compound, they are achiral. So the chiral HPLC won't separate them. Each diol would still give a single peak.

But wait, perhaps the diols from E and Z are not meso. Maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but in a racemic form. Wait, but in the problem statement, each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each would form a single enantiomer, or a single diastereomer.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

When (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, you get a trans epoxide. Then, acid treatment leads to a diol. The attack of water would lead to two possible diastereomers, but due to the symmetry, they might form a single meso compound.

Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would form a cis diol, which is also a meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, for (E) epoxide, the diol would have the hydroxyls on the same face, but due to the symmetry, it's meso. Similarly, for (Z) epoxide, the diol would have hydroxyls on the same face, but maybe a different configuration, but due to symmetry, it's also meso.

Wait, but if the diol from (E) is meso and the diol from (Z) is also meso, but different compounds, then each would have a single peak.

So, in the combined product, you have two different diols, each a meso compound. When run on an achiral column, each would produce a single peak. So two peaks. On a chiral column, each would still be a single peak (since they're achiral), so again two peaks.

So the correct option should be C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Looking at the options:

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Yes, that makes sense.


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the resulting products are analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA is a stereospecific oxidizing agent that forms epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a trans configuration, while for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a cis configuration.
   - Acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxides leads to the formation of diols. The stereochemistry of the diols depends on the stereochemistry of the starting epoxides.

2. **Epoxide to Diol Conversion**:
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the trans epoxide forms a meso diol upon ring opening. This diol has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the cis epoxide also forms a meso diol upon ring opening. This diol is also achiral for the same reason.

3. **Products**:
   - Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso diol from the (E)-oct-4-ene.
   - Reaction 2 produces a single, achiral meso diol from the (Z)-oct-4-ene.
   - The two diols are structurally distinct and do not interconvert.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Since both diols are achiral, they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, but since both diols are achiral (meso compounds), they will each elute as a single peak. Thus, the chiral HPLC will also show **2 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in both the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.
