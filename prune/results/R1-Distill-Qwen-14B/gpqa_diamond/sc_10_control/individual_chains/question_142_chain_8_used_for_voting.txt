Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. In this case, the matrix is given as an average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Wait, each of these is a projection operator. So, when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, you're essentially creating a statistical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So this must be a mixed state, right? Because if it were a pure state, it would have higher coherence or something else, but I'm not sure about the exact terms here.

Wait, but wait. I think when you take a completely mixed state for a qubit, it's represented by the density matrix (I + σ_z)/2, but maybe that's for a qubit in the X basis or something. Alternatively, I remember that for a single qubit, the space can be thought of as a Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be represented as a point on this sphere, where the Bloch vector gives the coordinates.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r has components (x, y, z), and each component corresponds to the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix. The magnitude of r must be ≤ 1 because it's a unit vector on the Bloch sphere.

So, given ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|), let's expand this. |0><0| is the outer product, which is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right. Adding these together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Multiply by 1/2, and each diagonal element is 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, but I also know that the identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So, let's see: if I write ρ as (I + something)/2, what would that something be?

Let me compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 and see if it matches ρ.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let's compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So adding r_z σ_z would give [[1 + r_z, 0], [0, 1 - r_z]]. The other terms, σ_x and σ_y, would introduce off-diagonal elements.

The given ρ is diagonal, so any terms with σ_x or σ_y must be zero because they would produce off-diagonal elements, which are zero in ρ. Therefore, r_x and r_y must be zero. So the only term left is r_z.

So, (I + r_z σ_z)/2 equals our ρ. Let's compute this. (I + r_z σ_z) is [[1 + r_z, 0], [0, 1 - r_z]]. Divided by 2, it becomes [[(1 + r_z)/2, 0], [0, (1 - r_z)/2]]. But our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], so each diagonal element is 0.5.

Setting (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5. Let's solve for r_z. For the first equation: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z=0. Similarly, the second equation gives (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z=1 → r_z=0.

Wait, so r_z is zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Does that make sense?

Wait, the Bloch vector for the completely mixed state is at the origin. Because the density matrix is the maximally mixed state, which should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, the origin is the completely mixed state.

So the density matrix in this case is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as (I)/2. So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning the point is at the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait again. Another way to think about this: the density matrix ρ is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal, which is the same as (|+> <+| + |-> <->|)/2, but no, wait, |+> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2). So perhaps that's the same as the mixed state.

Alternatively, the state is a completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state. So its position on the Bloch sphere is the origin. So the vector r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), expanding \( \rho \) shows that it is diagonal with equal probabilities \( \frac{1}{2} \) for both \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). This implies that the off-diagonal terms (associated with \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \)) must vanish, so \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). 

The diagonal terms correspond to \( r_z \), and solving for \( r_z \) shows that it also vanishes. Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, where there is no preference for either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The vector r has components (x, y, z), and each component corresponds to the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix. The magnitude of r must be ≤ 1 because it's a unit vector on the Bloch sphere.

So, given ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|), let's expand this. |0><0| is the outer product, which is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right. Adding these together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Multiply by 1/2, and each diagonal element is 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, but I also know that the identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So, let's see: if I write ρ as (I + something)/2, what would that something be?

Let me compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 and see if it matches ρ.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let's compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So adding r_z σ_z would give [[1 + r_z, 0], [0, 1 - r_z]]. The other terms, σ_x and σ_y, would introduce off-diagonal elements.

The given ρ is diagonal, so any terms with σ_x or σ_y must be zero because they would produce off-diagonal elements, which are zero in ρ. Therefore, r_x and r_y must be zero. So the only term left is r_z.

So, (I + r_z σ_z)/2 equals our ρ. Let's compute this. (I + r_z σ_z) is [[1 + r_z, 0], [0, 1 - r_z]]. Divided by 2, it becomes [[(1 + r_z)/2, 0], [0, (1 - r_z)/2]]. But our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], so each diagonal element is 0.5.

Setting (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5. Let's solve for r_z. For the first equation: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z=0. Similarly, the second equation gives (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z=1 → r_z=0.

Wait, so r_z is zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Does that make sense?

Wait, the Bloch vector for the completely mixed state is at the origin. Because the density matrix is the maximally mixed state, which should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, the origin is the completely mixed state.

So the density matrix in this case is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as (I)/2. So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning the point is at the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait again. Another way to think about this: the density matrix ρ is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal, which is the same as (|+> <+| + |-> <->|)/2, but no, wait, |+> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2). So perhaps that's the same as the mixed state.

Alternatively, the state is a completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state. So its position on the Bloch sphere is the origin. So the vector r is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), expanding \( \rho \) shows that it is diagonal with equal probabilities \( \frac{1}{2} \) for both \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). This implies that the off-diagonal terms (associated with \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \)) must vanish, so \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). 

The diagonal terms correspond to \( r_z \), and solving for \( r_z \) shows that it also vanishes. Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, where there is no preference for either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
