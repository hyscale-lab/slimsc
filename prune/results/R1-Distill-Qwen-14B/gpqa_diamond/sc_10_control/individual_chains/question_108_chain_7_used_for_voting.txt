Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and magnetic fields. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, wait, paramagnetic coupling—I remember that has something to do with the interaction between a magnetic field and the magnetic moment of an atom. Oh right, it's the Zeeman effect maybe? Or is it the fine structure? Wait, no, Zeeman is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field, and the paramagnetic coupling is part of that.

So the setup is a magnetic field B pointing along the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis, right? And m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh, but the values of m are small. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, which can take values like -l, -l+1,..., 0,..., l. So if m is small, maybe m is zero or one? Or perhaps the problem is generally considering small m, so the coupling term would be proportional to m.

The problem says B is 1 Tesla. That's a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet.

We're supposed to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a specific wavelength. The wavelength given is λ = 0.4861 μm. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nanometers. I remember that's in the visible range, perhaps the Balmer series. Because the Balmer-alpha line is around 656 nm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the lines. No, wait, 0.486 μm is around 486 nm. Let me think—what transition is that? Oh, I think that's the Balmer-beta line, but I'm not certain. Either way, the point is, it's a transition in hydrogen, so the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength.

So first, I need to find ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is about 13.6 eV. But wait, the energy can be calculated using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

Right, so let's calculate ΔE. Let's get the formula down. E = hc/(lambda). But wait, the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R (1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)), and the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower, which for emission is negative when going from higher to lower energy.

But in any case, the absolute value is what matters here. So let me proceed with E = hc/lambda.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters, or 4.861e-7 meters.

Calculating E:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m)

Let me compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

Hmm, converting that into electron volts because that's a more familiar unit for atomic physics. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that's about 2.55 eV. So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Because 0.4861 μm is 486 nm, which is actually the Balmer-beta line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, right? Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Let me recall: Balmer-alpha is n=5 to n=2 (656 nm), Balmer-beta is n=4 to n=2 (486 nm), yes. So that's correct.

So the energy difference for that transition is about 2.55 eV. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using E = hc/lambda:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value as per SI)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
lambda = 486.1e-9 meters.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (486.1e-9)

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m. Wait, but more accurately:

6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = 6.62607015e-34 * approx 3e8.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then dividing by 486.1e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 / (486.1e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = 4.088e-19 J.

Yes, same as before. So converting to eV: 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in the Rydberg formula approach. Let me think another way. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, and each energy level is E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So for n=2, E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

For n=4, E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV.

So the transition from n=4 to n=2 would have ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV, as I calculated earlier. So that's correct.

Now, the other part is the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling, I think, is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g μ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, no, for orbital angular momentum, it's m here, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So the magnetic dipole moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (e/(2m)) * (L_z) / ħ. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (e/(2m)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So H would be proportional to L · B.

Wait, let's think about the expectation value. The expectation value of H would be proportional to m, since L_z = mħ, so ⟨L_z⟩ = mħ. So H = -μ B cos(theta), but since B is along Oz, the angle theta is 0, so cos(theta) is 1, so H = -μ B.

Wait, but the direction matters. The magnetic moment is μ = (e/(2m)) L, so H = -μ · B = -(e/(2m)) * (L · B). Since B is along Oz, L · B is L_z B. So H = -(e B/(2m)) L_z. Then the expectation value is ⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2m)) ⟨L_z⟩.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is mħ, because L_z |m> = mħ |m>, so ⟨L_z⟩= mħ.

So substituting, ⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2m)) * m ħ.

Wait, the m in the denominator here is the mass of the electron, m_e. Let me write it correctly.

So, e is the elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

B is 1 T.

m_e is the electron mass, about 9.109e-31 kg.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So putting it all together:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * (m ħ)

Wait, but wait, in the expression, the term is (e B/(2m)) * m ħ. Let me compute that:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * m * ħ.

Wait, but wait, m in this case is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can take values like 0, ±1, ±2, etc., up to l. So for small m, like m=0, the term is zero. But if m is small but non-zero, say m=1, then it's non-zero.

Wait, but the question says 'small values of m', so perhaps m=1 or m=0. Let's say m=1. Then:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * 1 * ħ.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude instead of worrying about the sign. Let's proceed.

So the value is:

⟨H⟩ = (e B m ħ) / (2 m_e).

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (μ0/(4π)) * (e/(2m)) * L, where μ0 is the permeability of free space. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some constants. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital angular momentum, μ = (μ_B) * L_z / ħ, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (e ħ)/(2 m_e), approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So, H = -μ · B = -μ_B * (L_z / ħ) * B.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * B * ⟨L_z⟩ / ħ.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is m ħ, so ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * B * m ħ / ħ = -μ_B B m.

So the magnitude is |⟨H⟩| = μ_B B m.

Wait, but wait, maybe I missed a factor. Alternatively, let's compute it properly.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term is given by H_para = (e B)/(2 m_e c) L_z.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (e/(2 m_e)) * L_z / ħ * ħ, which simplifies to μ = (e/(2 m_e)) L_z.

Wait, so H_para = -μ · B = - (e/(2 m_e)) L_z B.

Thus, ⟨H_para⟩ = - (e/(2 m_e)) B ⟨L_z⟩.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is m ħ, so ⟨H_para⟩ = - (e/(2 m_e)) B m ħ.

So the magnitude is (e B m ħ)/(2 m_e).

Let me compute this value for m=1, as the smallest non-zero value.

Plugging in the numbers:

e = 1.602e-19 C
B = 1 T
m = 1
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
m_e = 9.109e-31 kg

So:

(e * B * m * ħ) / (2 m_e) = (1.602e-19 C * 1 T * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg)

Compute numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.693e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg ≈ 1.8218e-30 kg.

So (1.693e-53) / (1.8218e-30) ≈ (1.693 / 1.8218) ) * 1e-23 ≈ 0.929 * 1e-23 = 9.29e-24 J.

Wait, 9.29e-24 J is about how much in eV? Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.29e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Hmm, that's 5.8e-5 eV, which is 0.000058 eV.

Now, the transition energy ΔE was about 2.55 eV.

So comparing ⟨H_para⟩ (about 5.8e-5 eV) with ΔE (2.55 eV), which is much larger.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the calculation for ⟨H_para⟩ gave 9.29e-24 J, which is about 5.8e-5 eV. So that's about 58 micro-eV.

But ΔE is 2.55 eV, which is 2.55e3 milli-eV, or 2,550,000 micro-eV.

So comparing 58 micro-eV to 2.55 million micro-eV, the coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the numerator precisely:

e = 1.60217663e-19 C
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
B = 1 T
m = 1
m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg

So numerator: e * B * m * ħ = 1.60217663e-19 * 1 * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 = (1.60217663 * 1.0545718) * 1e-53.

1.60217663 * 1.0545718 ≈ 1.693e0.

So numerator ≈ 1.693e-53.

Denominator: 2 * 9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

So (1.693e-53) / (1.8218767e-30) ≈ (1.693 / 1.8218767) ) * 1e-23 ≈ approximately 0.929 * 1e-23 = 9.29e-24 J.

Wait, 9.29e-24 J is 9.29e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. So yes, about 5.8e-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV.

So the ratio is 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about two thousandthousandths of the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, could there be a mistake? Because in some contexts, the paramagnetic term is considered significant, but maybe here it's negligible.

Wait, but let me think about the possible mistake. Did I forget any factor? For instance, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling includes relativistic effects or other terms?

Wait, another approach: paramagnetic coupling in hydrogen is usually considered a small effect compared to the main energy levels. Because the magnetic interactions are typically much smaller than the electric (Coulomb) interactions.

But in this problem, we're comparing it to the transition energy. So the transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states, which is a large value, while the paramagnetic coupling is a small perturbation.

So ⟨H_para⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So the correct comparison is ⟨H_para⟩ << ΔE, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the exponents.

Another way: 5.8e-5 eV is 0.000058 eV. 2.55 eV is 2,550,000 times larger, which is a factor of about 2.5e6. So 5.8e-5 is 2.5e6 times smaller than 2.55 eV.

So ⟨H_para⟩ is much less than ΔE, so the answer should be option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So if the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE, then option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we calculate both quantities and analyze their relative magnitudes.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the transition energy is approximately \( \Delta E = 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the orbital magnetic moment and the external magnetic field \( B \). The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:

\[
H = -\mu \cdot B = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} L_z,
\]

where:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field),
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( L_z = m \hbar \) (orbital angular momentum along \( z \), with \( m \) being the orbital magnetic quantum number).

The expectation value of \( H \) is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} \langle L_z \rangle = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} m \hbar.
\]

Substituting the values (\( m = 1 \), \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)):

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1)}{2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31})} (1)(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}).
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \approx 1.693 \times 10^{-53}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{1.693 \times 10^{-53}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 9.29 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert to electron volts:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.29 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( \langle H \rangle = 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison of ⟨H⟩ and ΔE
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Comparing their magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This shows that \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

---

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and magnetic fields. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, wait, paramagnetic coupling—I remember that has something to do with the interaction between a magnetic field and the magnetic moment of an atom. Oh right, it's the Zeeman effect maybe? Or is it the fine structure? Wait, no, Zeeman is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field, and the paramagnetic coupling is part of that.

So the setup is a magnetic field B pointing along the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis, right? And m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh, but the values of m are small. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, which can take values like -l, -l+1,..., 0,..., l. So if m is small, maybe m is zero or one? Or perhaps the problem is generally considering small m, so the coupling term would be proportional to m.

The problem says B is 1 Tesla. That's a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet.

We're supposed to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a specific wavelength. The wavelength given is λ = 0.4861 μm. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nanometers. I remember that's in the visible range, perhaps the Balmer series. Because the Balmer-alpha line is around 656 nm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the lines. No, wait, 0.486 μm is around 486 nm. Let me think—what transition is that? Oh, I think that's the Balmer-beta line, but I'm not certain. Either way, the point is, it's a transition in hydrogen, so the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength.

So first, I need to find ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is about 13.6 eV. But wait, the energy can be calculated using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

Right, so let's calculate ΔE. Let's get the formula down. E = hc/(lambda). But wait, the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R (1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)), and the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower, which for emission is negative when going from higher to lower energy.

But in any case, the absolute value is what matters here. So let me proceed with E = hc/lambda.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters, or 4.861e-7 meters.

Calculating E:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m)

Let me compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

Hmm, converting that into electron volts because that's a more familiar unit for atomic physics. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that's about 2.55 eV. So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Because 0.4861 μm is 486 nm, which is actually the Balmer-beta line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, right? Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Let me recall: Balmer-alpha is n=5 to n=2 (656 nm), Balmer-beta is n=4 to n=2 (486 nm), yes. So that's correct.

So the energy difference for that transition is about 2.55 eV. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using E = hc/lambda:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value as per SI)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
lambda = 486.1e-9 meters.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (486.1e-9)

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m. Wait, but more accurately:

6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = 6.62607015e-34 * approx 3e8.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then dividing by 486.1e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 / (486.1e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = 4.088e-19 J.

Yes, same as before. So converting to eV: 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in the Rydberg formula approach. Let me think another way. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, and each energy level is E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So for n=2, E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

For n=4, E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV.

So the transition from n=4 to n=2 would have ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV, as I calculated earlier. So that's correct.

Now, the other part is the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling, I think, is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g μ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, no, for orbital angular momentum, it's m here, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So the magnetic dipole moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (e/(2m)) * (L_z) / ħ. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (e/(2m)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So H would be proportional to L · B.

Wait, let's think about the expectation value. The expectation value of H would be proportional to m, since L_z = mħ, so ⟨L_z⟩ = mħ. So H = -μ B cos(theta), but since B is along Oz, the angle theta is 0, so cos(theta) is 1, so H = -μ B.

Wait, but the direction matters. The magnetic moment is μ = (e/(2m)) L, so H = -μ · B = -(e/(2m)) * (L · B). Since B is along Oz, L · B is L_z B. So H = -(e B/(2m)) L_z. Then the expectation value is ⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2m)) ⟨L_z⟩.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is mħ, because L_z |m> = mħ |m>, so ⟨L_z⟩= mħ.

So substituting, ⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2m)) * m ħ.

Wait, the m in the denominator here is the mass of the electron, m_e. Let me write it correctly.

So, e is the elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

B is 1 T.

m_e is the electron mass, about 9.109e-31 kg.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So putting it all together:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * (m ħ)

Wait, but wait, in the expression, the term is (e B/(2m)) * m ħ. Let me compute that:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * m * ħ.

Wait, but wait, m in this case is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can take values like 0, ±1, ±2, etc., up to l. So for small m, like m=0, the term is zero. But if m is small but non-zero, say m=1, then it's non-zero.

Wait, but the question says 'small values of m', so perhaps m=1 or m=0. Let's say m=1. Then:

⟨H⟩ = -(e B/(2 m_e)) * 1 * ħ.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude instead of worrying about the sign. Let's proceed.

So the value is:

⟨H⟩ = (e B m ħ) / (2 m_e).

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (μ0/(4π)) * (e/(2m)) * L, where μ0 is the permeability of free space. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some constants. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital angular momentum, μ = (μ_B) * L_z / ħ, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (e ħ)/(2 m_e), approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So, H = -μ · B = -μ_B * (L_z / ħ) * B.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * B * ⟨L_z⟩ / ħ.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is m ħ, so ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B * B * m ħ / ħ = -μ_B B m.

So the magnitude is |⟨H⟩| = μ_B B m.

Wait, but wait, maybe I missed a factor. Alternatively, let's compute it properly.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term is given by H_para = (e B)/(2 m_e c) L_z.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (e/(2 m_e)) * L_z / ħ * ħ, which simplifies to μ = (e/(2 m_e)) L_z.

Wait, so H_para = -μ · B = - (e/(2 m_e)) L_z B.

Thus, ⟨H_para⟩ = - (e/(2 m_e)) B ⟨L_z⟩.

But ⟨L_z⟩ is m ħ, so ⟨H_para⟩ = - (e/(2 m_e)) B m ħ.

So the magnitude is (e B m ħ)/(2 m_e).

Let me compute this value for m=1, as the smallest non-zero value.

Plugging in the numbers:

e = 1.602e-19 C
B = 1 T
m = 1
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
m_e = 9.109e-31 kg

So:

(e * B * m * ħ) / (2 m_e) = (1.602e-19 C * 1 T * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg)

Compute numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.602 * 1.05457 ≈ 1.693e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg ≈ 1.8218e-30 kg.

So (1.693e-53) / (1.8218e-30) ≈ (1.693 / 1.8218) ) * 1e-23 ≈ 0.929 * 1e-23 = 9.29e-24 J.

Wait, 9.29e-24 J is about how much in eV? Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.29e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Hmm, that's 5.8e-5 eV, which is 0.000058 eV.

Now, the transition energy ΔE was about 2.55 eV.

So comparing ⟨H_para⟩ (about 5.8e-5 eV) with ΔE (2.55 eV), which is much larger.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the calculation for ⟨H_para⟩ gave 9.29e-24 J, which is about 5.8e-5 eV. So that's about 58 micro-eV.

But ΔE is 2.55 eV, which is 2.55e3 milli-eV, or 2,550,000 micro-eV.

So comparing 58 micro-eV to 2.55 million micro-eV, the coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the numerator precisely:

e = 1.60217663e-19 C
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
B = 1 T
m = 1
m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg

So numerator: e * B * m * ħ = 1.60217663e-19 * 1 * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 = (1.60217663 * 1.0545718) * 1e-53.

1.60217663 * 1.0545718 ≈ 1.693e0.

So numerator ≈ 1.693e-53.

Denominator: 2 * 9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

So (1.693e-53) / (1.8218767e-30) ≈ (1.693 / 1.8218767) ) * 1e-23 ≈ approximately 0.929 * 1e-23 = 9.29e-24 J.

Wait, 9.29e-24 J is 9.29e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. So yes, about 5.8e-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV.

So the ratio is 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about two thousandthousandths of the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, could there be a mistake? Because in some contexts, the paramagnetic term is considered significant, but maybe here it's negligible.

Wait, but let me think about the possible mistake. Did I forget any factor? For instance, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling includes relativistic effects or other terms?

Wait, another approach: paramagnetic coupling in hydrogen is usually considered a small effect compared to the main energy levels. Because the magnetic interactions are typically much smaller than the electric (Coulomb) interactions.

But in this problem, we're comparing it to the transition energy. So the transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states, which is a large value, while the paramagnetic coupling is a small perturbation.

So ⟨H_para⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So the correct comparison is ⟨H_para⟩ << ΔE, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the exponents.

Another way: 5.8e-5 eV is 0.000058 eV. 2.55 eV is 2,550,000 times larger, which is a factor of about 2.5e6. So 5.8e-5 is 2.5e6 times smaller than 2.55 eV.

So ⟨H_para⟩ is much less than ΔE, so the answer should be option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So if the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE, then option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we calculate both quantities and analyze their relative magnitudes.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the transition energy is approximately \( \Delta E = 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the orbital magnetic moment and the external magnetic field \( B \). The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:

\[
H = -\mu \cdot B = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} L_z,
\]

where:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field),
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( L_z = m \hbar \) (orbital angular momentum along \( z \), with \( m \) being the orbital magnetic quantum number).

The expectation value of \( H \) is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} \langle L_z \rangle = -\frac{e B}{2 m_e} m \hbar.
\]

Substituting the values (\( m = 1 \), \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)):

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1)}{2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31})} (1)(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}).
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \approx 1.693 \times 10^{-53}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{1.693 \times 10^{-53}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 9.29 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert to electron volts:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.29 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( \langle H \rangle = 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison of ⟨H⟩ and ΔE
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Comparing their magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This shows that \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

---

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct option is:
