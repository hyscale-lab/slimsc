Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are from A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms a complex with metal ions like calcium. The complex is usually something like CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA. So, the stability constant K is given, and I think it's the formation constant for the complex.

The formula for the stability constant is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M, right?

So, if I set up the equation: K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). I'm supposed to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, but I'm not given the concentration of free EDTA. Hmm. Oh, but wait, when the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1, but does that mean that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex? Or is there some free EDTA?

Wait, no. Because the complex is 0.02 M, that's the concentration of the complex. But the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. But if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, the amount of EDTA added is just enough to form the complex without excess. So, perhaps, the initial concentration of EDTA and calcium are each 0.02 M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. The stability constant equation is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y]). 

But what's [Y], the free EDTA? Because in solution, some EDTA is in the complex, and some is free. So, if all the EDTA is in the complex, [Y] would be zero, which can't be right because then K would be undefined. So there must be a tiny amount of free EDTA.

Wait, but since K is very large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable. So the amount of free EDTA would be very small, and the amount of free Ca²+ would also be very small.

So, in this case, we can approximate [EDTA] ≈ [Ca²+] because for every mole of Ca²+ that dissociates, a mole of EDTA is released. So, if I let [Ca²+] = x, then [EDTA] ≈ x. 

Then, the equation becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²). So solving for x:

5e10 = 0.02/(x²)
=> x² = 0.02/(5e10)
=> x² = 2e-13
=> x = sqrt(2e-13)
Hmm, sqrt(2e-13) is about sqrt(2)*1e-6.5? Let me calculate it.

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 which is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 4.47e-7. Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, sqrt(2e-13) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(1e-13) = 1.414 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 4.47e-7 M.

But that's [Ca²+], which would be about 4.5e-7 M. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, close but not the same.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, K is 5e10, [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. So K = [CaY]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

The assumption is that [EDTA] ≈ [Ca²+] because each Ca²+ that dissociates releases one EDTA. So [EDTA] = x.

So K = (0.02) / (x²) = 5e10.

So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Wait, no:

Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5e12) = 0.4e-12? No, 5e10 is 5 * 1e10.

Wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. So 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Ah, that's where option C comes from. So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer would be C. But wait, why did I get 4.47e-7 earlier? Oh, because I made a mistake in the calculation of x^2. Let me correct that.

So to recap:

K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)
=> x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 => x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant equation:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Since the complex dissociates into one calcium ion and one EDTA ion, the concentrations of free calcium ions and free EDTA ions are equal, i.e., \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}] = x\).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Then, the equation becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²). So solving for x:

5e10 = 0.02/(x²)
=> x² = 0.02/(5e10)
=> x² = 2e-13
=> x = sqrt(2e-13)
Hmm, sqrt(2e-13) is about sqrt(2)*1e-6.5? Let me calculate it.

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 which is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 4.47e-7. Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, sqrt(2e-13) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(1e-13) = 1.414 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 4.47e-7 M.

But that's [Ca²+], which would be about 4.5e-7 M. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, close but not the same.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, K is 5e10, [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. So K = [CaY]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

The assumption is that [EDTA] ≈ [Ca²+] because each Ca²+ that dissociates releases one EDTA. So [EDTA] = x.

So K = (0.02) / (x²) = 5e10.

So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Wait, no:

Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5e12) = 0.4e-12? No, 5e10 is 5 * 1e10.

Wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. So 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Ah, that's where option C comes from. So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer would be C. But wait, why did I get 4.47e-7 earlier? Oh, because I made a mistake in the calculation of x^2. Let me correct that.

So to recap:

K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)
=> x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 => x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant equation:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Since the complex dissociates into one calcium ion and one EDTA ion, the concentrations of free calcium ions and free EDTA ions are equal, i.e., \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}] = x\).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
