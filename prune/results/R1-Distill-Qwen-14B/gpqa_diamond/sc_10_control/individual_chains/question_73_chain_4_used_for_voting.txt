Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So first, relative speed. I remember that when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract the velocities normally. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference in their velocities divided by that factor.

Let me compute that. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator, let's calculate. (0.6*0.5)c² is 0.3 c². Divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. That matches options C and D for the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma here is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=approx 1.1547. So energy is about 1.1547 * 3m c²= 3.4641 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96mc², and option B has E=4.96. Well, wait, I think I did that right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.6c: 0.6 squared is 0.36, 1-0.36 is 0.64, sqrt is 0.8, so gamma is 1.25. Yes. 1.25 *2m is 2.5 mc^2.

0.5c squared is 0.25, so denominator 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt is around 0.866. So 1/0.866 is approximately 1.1547. 3m *1.1547 is about 3.464. So 2.5+3.464=5.964, which is about 5.96mc². So the total energy is 5.96 mc^2.

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C matches both the relative speed and the energy.

Alternatively, wait, is there another way to compute the total energy? Oh, another approach: perhaps the center of momentum frame? But I don't think the question is asking for that. It's just the total energy of the system, which is the sum of their individual energies. So yeah, as above.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches options C and D.

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
