Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X with a given mass. Let's see.

The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, wait, I think that notation might be a bit off. Oh, wait, probably it's something like L = -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f (ῡ + X). Or maybe it's more accurately written as L = -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) evaluated at y, but I might not need to get too deep into the Lagrangian details.

Wait, the key point is probably the interaction term. So the boson X couples to fermions. The term involves ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So X is interacting with fermions, which means X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right?

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, I need to find out which of the given options are kinematically allowed. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X.

Let me think about the fermion masses. I remember that the known fermions have various masses. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV, so very light.
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like around 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Other particles like neutrinos are even lighter, but they are leptons and may not be considered here since the interaction is with X, but not sure.

Now, the X boson is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion must have a mass less than (M_X)/2 because each would take at least that mass. Let's compute M_X/2: 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be produced in a pair. Let's see which fermions meet this.

Checking quarks:

- u, d, s, c: all have masses way below 3 GeV. b is about 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV, so b quarks can't be produced as a pair because each would need at least 4.5 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. Wait, wait: for a pair, each fermion's mass m must satisfy 2m ≤ M_X. So for b quarks, each is 4.5 GeV, so 2m = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So no, X can't decay into b bbar.

Same with top quarks: t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so that's impossible.

Now for leptons:

- e: 0.511 MeV → definitely allowed.
- μ: 105.7 MeV → allowed.
- τ: 1.78 GeV → each is about 1.78 GeV. 2 * 1.78 = ~3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is less than 6 GeV? Oh wait, no. Wait, 3.56 is less than 6, so 2mτ = 3.56 GeV. So X is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6 → yes, allowed. So τ pairs are allowed.

What about neutrinos? The interaction might involve them, but the given options don't seem to include neutrinos, so perhaps they're not considered here.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I thought b can't decay because 4.5 GeV per b, so 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV. So option A includes b decay, which should be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c quark is about 1.3 GeV, so 2*1.3=2.6 <6 → allowed. So c is fine. So B includes c. But why is it allowed? Because 2.6 <6. So B includes c, which is allowed. So B is a possible option.

Option C: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So decay into t tbar is impossible. So option C includes t, which is impossible, so C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

But b's 2m is 9 GeV >6, so D includes b. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Oh, in option B, it has c, which is allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about tau? The tau is about 1.78 GeV. 2m = 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6 → allowed. So tau is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

- c cbar (since 2m_c=2.6 <6)
- s sbar (each s is ~95 MeV, 2m= ~ .19 GeV <<6)
- u ubar (each u ~2 MeV, negligible)
- d dbar (each ~5 MeV, negligible)
- tau+ tau- (each 1.78 GeV, 2m=3.56 GeV <6)
- mu+ mu- (each ~0.105 GeV, 2m=0.21 <<6)
- e+ e- (each ~0.000511 GeV, 2m negligible)

So all these are allowed. So the allowed decays are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking back at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but option B includes c, which is allowed. Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer must be option B or D? Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

So that includes all the allowed fermions except for the bottom quark and top quark, etc.

So yes, the correct kinematically allowed decays are the ones in option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy to decay from \( X \))
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

Using the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the allowed fermions are:
- \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \), as their combined masses satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
- \( b \) and \( t \) are excluded because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X with a given mass. Let's see.

Oh, wait, probably it's something like L = -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f (ῡ + X). Or maybe it's more accurately written as L = -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) evaluated at y, but I might not need to get too deep into the Lagrangian details.

Wait, the key point is probably the interaction term. So the boson X couples to fermions. The term involves ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So X is interacting with fermions, which means X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right?

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, I need to find out which of the given options are kinematically allowed. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X.

Let me think about the fermion masses. I remember that the known fermions have various masses. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV, so very light.
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like around 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Other particles like neutrinos are even lighter, but they are leptons and may not be considered here since the interaction is with X, but not sure.

Now, the X boson is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion must have a mass less than (M_X)/2 because each would take at least that mass. Let's compute M_X/2: 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be produced in a pair. Let's see which fermions meet this.

Checking quarks:

- u, d, s, c: all have masses way below 3 GeV. b is about 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV, so b quarks can't be produced as a pair because each would need at least 4.5 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. Wait, wait: for a pair, each fermion's mass m must satisfy 2m ≤ M_X. So for b quarks, each is 4.5 GeV, so 2m = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So no, X can't decay into b bbar.

Same with top quarks: t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so that's impossible.

Now for leptons:

- e: 0.511 MeV → definitely allowed.
- μ: 105.7 MeV → allowed.
- τ: 1.78 GeV → each is about 1.78 GeV. 2 * 1.78 = ~3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is less than 6 GeV? Oh wait, no. Wait, 3.56 is less than 6, so 2mτ = 3.56 GeV. So X is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6 → yes, allowed. So τ pairs are allowed.

What about neutrinos? The interaction might involve them, but the given options don't seem to include neutrinos, so perhaps they're not considered here.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I thought b can't decay because 4.5 GeV per b, so 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV. So option A includes b decay, which should be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c quark is about 1.3 GeV, so 2*1.3=2.6 <6 → allowed. So c is fine. So B includes c. But why is it allowed? Because 2.6 <6. So B includes c, which is allowed. So B is a possible option.

Option C: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So decay into t tbar is impossible. So option C includes t, which is impossible, so C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

But b's 2m is 9 GeV >6, so D includes b. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Oh, in option B, it has c, which is allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about tau? The tau is about 1.78 GeV. 2m = 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6 → allowed. So tau is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

- c cbar (since 2m_c=2.6 <6)
- s sbar (each s is ~95 MeV, 2m= ~ .19 GeV <<6)
- u ubar (each u ~2 MeV, negligible)
- d dbar (each ~5 MeV, negligible)
- tau+ tau- (each 1.78 GeV, 2m=3.56 GeV <6)
- mu+ mu- (each ~0.105 GeV, 2m=0.21 <<6)
- e+ e- (each ~0.000511 GeV, 2m negligible)

So all these are allowed. So the allowed decays are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking back at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but option B includes c, which is allowed. Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer must be option B or D? Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

So that includes all the allowed fermions except for the bottom quark and top quark, etc.

So yes, the correct kinematically allowed decays are the ones in option B.
