Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh wait, but wait, the particles are identical, so their wavefunctions have to be antisymmetric if they have the same quantum numbers. But wait, no, spin-1/2 particles have spin 1/2, so each has a spin state that can be up or down. That affects the overall wavefunction when you have multiple particles.

The question is about calculating the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energies are given in terms of E, where E is pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. So E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Each particle in the well has energy levels given by E_n = (n²)E, where n is the principal quantum number. Wait, or is it (n²) times that base energy E? I think that's right. So each particle's energy is E_n = n² E.

But since these are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. That means each quantum state can be occupied by only one fermion. But wait, each particle has both spatial and spin parts to their wavefunction. So the total wavefunction is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. For identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

So when you have multiple particles, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering spin. Since each particle is in the same spatial state, but different spin states. Wait no, no, because if all particles are in the same spatial wavefunction, their spins have to form an antisymmetric state. But wait, spin-1/2 particles can have spin up or down. For four particles, each can have two possible spin states. So maybe that allows multiple particles in the same spatial state? But wait, no. Because for four particles, each with two possible spin states, you can have up to two particles in each spatial state. Because the spin part must be symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think. For two particles, each with spin-1/2, you can have a singlet state (antisymmetric) or a triplet state (symmetric). But wait, the spatial part must account for the overall symmetry. So for each spatial state, you can have a maximum of two particles with opposite spins. Because that way, the total wavefunction is antisymmetric when you swap the two particles.

Wait, but here we have four particles. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles in a single spatial state is two. Because each can have spin up and spin down. So for four particles, you can have two spatial states, each holding two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but that's when they're all fermions and the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. Wait, maybe I should think about each particle's quantum numbers. Each particle's quantum state is determined by its spatial part (n) and spin part (up or down). So for each n, you can have two particles: one spin up, one spin down.

So, for four particles, you need to fill the lowest possible spatial states, considering that each can hold two particles.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible spatial states filled, each with two particles. Let's start filling:

n=1: can hold two particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold two particles (spin up and down)

Wait, but four particles would exactly fill n=1 and n=2, each holding two. So the ground state for four particles would have two in n=1, and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, each particle's energy is E_n. So for each particle in n=1, energy is E. Each in n=2, energy is 4E. So the total energy would be (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E +8E =10E. But wait, that's the total for all four particles.

Wait, but the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, etc. Wait, no, the question is about the energies of the system, meaning the total energy. So for the ground state, it's 10E. Then the first excited state would be when the next available spatial states are filled.

Wait, but maybe the ordering of the states is different. Let's think again.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy configuration. So all four particles are in the lowest possible spatial states. Since each spatial state can hold two particles (with opposite spins), the first two go into n=1 (each spin), the next two into n=2 (each spin).

So for four particles, the filled states would be n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 *4E) =2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait, E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. So E_n is n squared times E. So E_1 = E, E_2=4E, etc.

So the ground state has four particles. The first two (n=1) have E each, the next two (n=2) have 4E each. So the total is 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. How can that happen? Since the system can't have more than two particles in a single spatial state, the next state would involve moving one particle to the next available higher state. Wait, but when you have four particles, the first step would be to fill n=1, n=2, and then n=3? But no, wait n=3 can hold two more particles. But wait, we only have four particles.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step. The ground state is the lowest energy possible, so the particles fill the lowest available spatial states, each filled with two particles.

So four particles can be arranged as follows:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)

Total energy: 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, all the particles are in the lowest possible states. So to get an excited state, maybe one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher n, say n=3.

But wait, each spatial state can hold two particles. So to make the first excited state, perhaps we move two particles into n=3. But that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but each particle in n=2 has energy 4E. If two particles move to n=3, each would have energy 9E. So the total energy would be:

n=1: 2 particles * E =2E
n=2: 0 particles (since both moved up)
n=3: 2 particles *9E =18E
Total: 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, that's higher than the next option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves up. Let's see:

Wait, but because particles are fermions, you can't have more than two in a single spatial state. So to create an excited state, maybe one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with one particle and n=3 with one particle. But wait, each spatial state can hold two particles. So perhaps another particle would have to move there as well.

Wait, but for four particles, perhaps the first excited state would involve having one particle in n=3 and another in n=2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible configurations and their energies.

In the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). So energy is 10E.

The first excited state would be when the configuration is such that the highest occupied state is as low as possible, but higher than the ground state.

Wait, another possibility is that one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but since each n can hold two particles, perhaps the two in n=2 can't all move up. So perhaps in the first excited state, two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, can a single particle be in n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, but in this case, after filling n=1 with two, there are two more particles. If one is in n=2 and one in n=3, that's two particles in higher states.

Wait, but wait, maybe the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 move up to n=3. But that would take all four particles into n=1 and n=3. Wait, no, four particles: n=1 has two, n=3 has two. So the energy would be 2*E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, that's higher than the ground state's 10E, but perhaps it's a higher energy state.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2, so the configuration is two in n=1, and one each in n=2 and n=3. But that would require four particles. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the total energy would be 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but can you have one particle in n=2 and another in n=3? Because each n can hold two particles, so you can have that.

Wait, but wait, if you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the system's total energy would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) =15E. That's a possible first excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two are in n=3. Then the energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

Hmm, but which one is lower in energy? 15E is lower than 20E, so that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, leaving one in n=2. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about how the energy levels are filled. The ground state is the lowest possible, so the first excited state would be the next lowest possible configuration.

Wait, another approach: the possible total energies for four particles would be the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, possible configurations are:

- All four in the lowest possible n's. So n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total E=10E.

- Next, perhaps n=1 (2), n=2(1), n=3(1). Total E=2+4+9=15E.

- Or n=1 (2), n=2(0), n=3(2). Total E=2+0+18=20E.

- Or other configurations, like n=1 (1), n=2(2), n=3(1). But wait, can you have one in n=1 and two in n=2 and one in n=3? Let's see: n=1 has two possible spin states, so you can have two particles there. That's filled, so you can't have just one in n=1. So perhaps that's not possible.

So the first excited state would be the next lowest energy, which is 15E. The second excited state would be 20E.

Wait, but let me think again. How do the energy levels go? The ground state is 10E. First excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E. So the options are looking for the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states. So the numbers would be 10, 15, 20.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. Doesn't fit.

Option B:4E,10E,50E. No.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. Hmm, 10,15,18, which is close.

Option A:30E,39E,50E. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the possible configurations. Maybe the first excited state isn't 15E as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but wait, we have four particles. Let me think: The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2(2). So 10E.

The first excited state would have the next possible higher energy. So perhaps moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. So now you have n=1 (2), n=2(1), n=3(1). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, the next possible configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2(0), n=3(2). So 2 + 0 + 18=20E. So that would be the second excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have n=1 (2), n=3(2). That's 2E + 18E=20E. So the first excited state is 20E, then the next is higher.

But that doesn't fit with the options. Because in the options, the second excited state is 50E in option A, but that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all possible configurations. Another approach: the possible energy levels for four particles would be the sum of the individual energies. The particles must be in the lowest possible states, considering spin.

So the ground state is all four in the lowest possible states. So two in n=1 (each spin), two in n=2 (each spin). So E_total=2*E +2*4E =10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The next possible configuration would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So E_total=2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves up, perhaps: n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. E_total=2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

Wait, but that would make the three energy levels 10E, 15E, 20E. Looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, but 20E is not 18E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but perhaps that leads to a different total energy. Let's calculate again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state isn't when one particle moves, but two move. Wait, the ground state is 10E, and the first excited state would be when two particles are in higher states. For example, two in n=3. So 2*9E=18E, plus two in n=1: 2E. Total 20E. So the first excited state is 20E, and the second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=4, making 2E +2*9E + 2*16E? Wait, that's more than four particles.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct way to fill the states. Another approach: the particles are spin-1/2, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So for four particles, the spatial part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but the spin part must adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but I think the key point is that each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the four particles must occupy the first two spatial states, each with two particles. So the ground state is n=1 (two), n=2 (two) → total energy 10E.

The first excited state would involve having the particles in higher spatial states. But wait, how to move from the ground state to an excited state? The next possible configuration is when one spatial state is higher. So perhaps n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted, perhaps making n=1 (two), n=2 (0), n=3 (two). So the energy would be 2E +0 + 18E=20E.

So the ground, first excited, and second excited states would have energies 10E, 15E, and 20E. But looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is when particles are in n=1 (two), n=3 (two), giving 2E + 18E=20E. So the energies would be 10,15,20. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is 4E,10E,15E. That would imply the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. But that doesn't match what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Let me think again.

Wait, four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D box. Each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, you need to fill the first two spatial states.

n=1: two particles → energy 1²E = E each → total 2E.

n=2: two particles → energy 4E each → total 8E.

Total energy for ground state: 2E +8E =10E.

So ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now you have:

n=1: two → 2E.

n=2: one →4E.

n=3: one →9E.

Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state is when another particle moves to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two.

Energy: 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E.

So the three energies are 10E (ground),15E (first excited),20E (second excited).

Looking at the options, none have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking. The question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E."

Wait, perhaps the ground state is the lowest possible, first excited is the next, etc. So in that case, the ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state is 20E.

But none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the second excited state.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so 2E +4E +16E=22E. No, that's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, so 2E + 18E=20E.

Then the second excited state is when another particle moves to higher states, perhaps n=4 and n=3.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 (so 2*9E=18E), and the remaining two in n=1 (2E). So the total is 20E. So the ground is 10E, first excited is 20E, second excited is higher. But that doesn't fit any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leading to 15E. Then the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, so now you have:

n=1:2E.

n=2: one (4E).

n=3: one (9E).

n=4: one (16E).

Wait, but that would require four particles, so two more: one in n=2, one in n=4. But that's four particles. So energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E =31E. That's higher than 20E, so maybe the second excited state is 31E. But again, none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the energies are 10,15,18.

How can that happen?

Ground state:10E (2E from n=1, 8E from n=2).

First excited state:15E (2E +4E +9E).

Second excited state:18E. How?

18E could be 9E *2. So perhaps two particles in n=3, which is 2 *9E=18E. But then, where are the other two? They would have to be in n=1, so 2E. So total E is 2E + 18E=20E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 (16E), but that would require more particles elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't about moving two particles, but moving one more. Let's see: if in the first excited state we have 15E, then the second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4 from n=2. So n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1. So energy is 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in higher states. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the possible options and see which one makes sense.

The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, option D's numbers are 10,15,18. How can that be achieved?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So for four particles:

n=1:2E (two particles)

n=2:4E (one particle)

n=3:9E (one particle)

Total E=2+4+9=15E.

Then, the second excited state could involve another particle moving to n=4, so:

n=1:2E

n=2:4E

n=3:9E

n=4:16E

But that's four particles: 2+1+1+0? No, wait, we have four particles. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and zero in n=4. Wait, that's only four.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles move to n=3. So n=1:2, n=3:2. So E=2E + 2*9E=20E.

But then the options don't have 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=2. But wait, n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the spin states. For four spin-1/2 particles, the possible spin configurations might allow certain spatial arrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are in the same spatial state but different spin states. But since each spatial state can hold two particles, four particles would require two spatial states, each holding two.

So the ground state is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), giving 10E.

The first excited state would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

The second excited state would be n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So 2E + 2*(16E)=34E. But none of the options have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two of the particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

So E=2E +18E=20E. That would be the first excited state. Then the second excited state is when two are in n=4 and two in n=1:2E + 32E=34E.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, leading to E=15E. Then the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, leading to E=2E + (n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1, n=4 has 1) → but that's three particles, so the fourth must be elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

I'm a bit stuck. Looking at the options, option D is 10,15,18. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would be two particles in n=3 (2*9E=18E), and the other two in n=1 (2E). So 20E total. But that doesn't match 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, second is 18E. How?

Wait, maybe the second excited state isn't about four particles, but perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and the other two in n=2. So n=2:2, n=3:2. So E=2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 15E, which would be the second excited state.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would violate the Pauli exclusion because n=2 can only hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when the spatial part is symmetric, and the spin part is antisymmetric. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4. But that's four particles. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's higher than 18E.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E: These are high, maybe for higher states.

B)4E,10E,50E: Maybe ground state is 4E (n=2?), but no, because four particles in ground state can't be all in n=2.

C)4E,10E,15E: Ground state 4E, maybe n=2 for two particles and n=1 for two? No, because 2E +8E=10E, not 4E.

D)10E,15E,18E: So ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E +18E=20E. But option D says 18E, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So E=2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. But again, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's impossible since n=2 can't hold more than two.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me think about the possible total energies when the particles are in different configurations.

Another approach: The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible spatial states, which is n=1 and n=2. So E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two particles. So E=2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E.

So the three energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps the question is considering the energy levels in a different way, such as considering each particle's energy individually and adding them, but perhaps the levels are filled in a way that the first excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=3.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible, which is n=1 and n=2. So E=10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, so E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is in n=3, making E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct option is option D, 10E,15E,18E, but that doesn't fit my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, making E=2E +4E +9E +16E=31E, which again doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the question is about the energies of the individual particles, but no, the question says the system's energies.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for which option's numbers make sense. For four particles in the ground state, the total energy is 10E.

The first excited state would be when the highest occupied state is n=3, so the total energy is 15E.

The second excited state would then be when the highest is n=4, total energy 27E (2E +4E +9E +16E) for four particles. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So E=2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So E=2E + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How would 18E happen? That would require two particles in n=3 and two in n=1: 2E + 18E=20E. No.

Alternatively, maybe one particle in n=3 and three in n=2? But n=2 can only have two, so that's impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option D: 10E,15E,18E. Because it's the only option where the ground state is 10E, which aligns with what I thought.

But without a clear way to reach 18E, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, the second is 20E, and that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the number of particles. Let me think again.

Four particles: each spatial state can hold two. So ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) →10E.

First excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) →15E.

Second excited: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) →20E.

So the energies are 10,15,20. But no option matches. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the options are misnumbered. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state isn't when two go to n=3, but when one goes to n=4. But that would make the second excited state 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So E=20E, and the ground state is 10E. Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=4: 2E + 2*16E=34E.

But the options don't have that.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options, option D has 10,15,18, which seem sequential, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1, making 20E, which is option B's third option. But no, option B's third is 50E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and the others in lower states. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the spin states.

Wait, perhaps the spin state also contributes to the energy. But no, the spin doesn't affect the energy in this case because the potential is spin-independent. So the energy depends only on the spatial part.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with option D:10E,15E,18E, even though I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in the well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each spatial state \(n\) can hold two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available spatial states.  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=2\): 2 particles, total energy \(2 \cdot 4E = 8E\).  
   Total energy for the ground state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle moves from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\).  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=2\): 1 particle, total energy \(4E\).  
   - \(n=3\): 1 particle, total energy \(9E\).  
   Total energy for the first excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle moves from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), leaving \(n=2\) empty and \(n=3\) with two particles.  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=3\): 2 particles, total energy \(2 \cdot 9E = 18E\).  
   Total energy for the second excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are too high and do not match the calculated energies.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect. The ground state energy should be \(10E\), not \(4E\).  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect. The ground state energy should be \(10E\), not \(4E\).  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated ground state (\(10E\)) and first excited state (\(15E\)), but the second excited state is listed as \(18E\), which does not align with the calculated \(20E\). However, this option is the closest to the correct pattern of increasing energies.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the available options, the most reasonable choice is **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**, even though the second excited state energy (\(18E\)) does not perfectly match the calculated value (\(20E\)).

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh wait, but wait, the particles are identical, so their wavefunctions have to be antisymmetric if they have the same quantum numbers. But wait, no, spin-1/2 particles have spin 1/2, so each has a spin state that can be up or down. That affects the overall wavefunction when you have multiple particles.

The question is about calculating the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energies are given in terms of E, where E is pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. So E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Each particle in the well has energy levels given by E_n = (n²)E, where n is the principal quantum number. Wait, or is it (n²) times that base energy E? I think that's right. So each particle's energy is E_n = n² E.

But since these are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. That means each quantum state can be occupied by only one fermion. But wait, each particle has both spatial and spin parts to their wavefunction. So the total wavefunction is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. For identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

So when you have multiple particles, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering spin. Since each particle is in the same spatial state, but different spin states. Wait no, no, because if all particles are in the same spatial wavefunction, their spins have to form an antisymmetric state. But wait, spin-1/2 particles can have spin up or down. For four particles, each can have two possible spin states. So maybe that allows multiple particles in the same spatial state? But wait, no. Because for four particles, each with two possible spin states, you can have up to two particles in each spatial state. Because the spin part must be symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think. For two particles, each with spin-1/2, you can have a singlet state (antisymmetric) or a triplet state (symmetric). But wait, the spatial part must account for the overall symmetry. So for each spatial state, you can have a maximum of two particles with opposite spins. Because that way, the total wavefunction is antisymmetric when you swap the two particles.

Wait, but here we have four particles. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles in a single spatial state is two. Because each can have spin up and spin down. So for four particles, you can have two spatial states, each holding two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but that's when they're all fermions and the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. Wait, maybe I should think about each particle's quantum numbers. Each particle's quantum state is determined by its spatial part (n) and spin part (up or down). So for each n, you can have two particles: one spin up, one spin down.

So, for four particles, you need to fill the lowest possible spatial states, considering that each can hold two particles.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible spatial states filled, each with two particles. Let's start filling:

n=1: can hold two particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold two particles (spin up and down)

Wait, but four particles would exactly fill n=1 and n=2, each holding two. So the ground state for four particles would have two in n=1, and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, each particle's energy is E_n. So for each particle in n=1, energy is E. Each in n=2, energy is 4E. So the total energy would be (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E +8E =10E. But wait, that's the total for all four particles.

Wait, but the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, etc. Wait, no, the question is about the energies of the system, meaning the total energy. So for the ground state, it's 10E. Then the first excited state would be when the next available spatial states are filled.

Wait, but maybe the ordering of the states is different. Let's think again.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy configuration. So all four particles are in the lowest possible spatial states. Since each spatial state can hold two particles (with opposite spins), the first two go into n=1 (each spin), the next two into n=2 (each spin).

So for four particles, the filled states would be n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 *4E) =2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait, E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. So E_n is n squared times E. So E_1 = E, E_2=4E, etc.

So the ground state has four particles. The first two (n=1) have E each, the next two (n=2) have 4E each. So the total is 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. How can that happen? Since the system can't have more than two particles in a single spatial state, the next state would involve moving one particle to the next available higher state. Wait, but when you have four particles, the first step would be to fill n=1, n=2, and then n=3? But no, wait n=3 can hold two more particles. But wait, we only have four particles.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step. The ground state is the lowest energy possible, so the particles fill the lowest available spatial states, each filled with two particles.

So four particles can be arranged as follows:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)

Total energy: 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, all the particles are in the lowest possible states. So to get an excited state, maybe one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher n, say n=3.

But wait, each spatial state can hold two particles. So to make the first excited state, perhaps we move two particles into n=3. But that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but each particle in n=2 has energy 4E. If two particles move to n=3, each would have energy 9E. So the total energy would be:

n=1: 2 particles * E =2E
n=2: 0 particles (since both moved up)
n=3: 2 particles *9E =18E
Total: 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, that's higher than the next option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves up. Let's see:

Wait, but because particles are fermions, you can't have more than two in a single spatial state. So to create an excited state, maybe one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with one particle and n=3 with one particle. But wait, each spatial state can hold two particles. So perhaps another particle would have to move there as well.

Wait, but for four particles, perhaps the first excited state would involve having one particle in n=3 and another in n=2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible configurations and their energies.

In the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). So energy is 10E.

The first excited state would be when the configuration is such that the highest occupied state is as low as possible, but higher than the ground state.

Wait, another possibility is that one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but since each n can hold two particles, perhaps the two in n=2 can't all move up. So perhaps in the first excited state, two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, can a single particle be in n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, but in this case, after filling n=1 with two, there are two more particles. If one is in n=2 and one in n=3, that's two particles in higher states.

Wait, but wait, maybe the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 move up to n=3. But that would take all four particles into n=1 and n=3. Wait, no, four particles: n=1 has two, n=3 has two. So the energy would be 2*E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, that's higher than the ground state's 10E, but perhaps it's a higher energy state.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2, so the configuration is two in n=1, and one each in n=2 and n=3. But that would require four particles. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the total energy would be 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but can you have one particle in n=2 and another in n=3? Because each n can hold two particles, so you can have that.

Wait, but wait, if you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the system's total energy would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) =15E. That's a possible first excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two are in n=3. Then the energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

Hmm, but which one is lower in energy? 15E is lower than 20E, so that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, leaving one in n=2. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about how the energy levels are filled. The ground state is the lowest possible, so the first excited state would be the next lowest possible configuration.

Wait, another approach: the possible total energies for four particles would be the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, possible configurations are:

- All four in the lowest possible n's. So n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total E=10E.

- Next, perhaps n=1 (2), n=2(1), n=3(1). Total E=2+4+9=15E.

- Or n=1 (2), n=2(0), n=3(2). Total E=2+0+18=20E.

- Or other configurations, like n=1 (1), n=2(2), n=3(1). But wait, can you have one in n=1 and two in n=2 and one in n=3? Let's see: n=1 has two possible spin states, so you can have two particles there. That's filled, so you can't have just one in n=1. So perhaps that's not possible.

So the first excited state would be the next lowest energy, which is 15E. The second excited state would be 20E.

Wait, but let me think again. How do the energy levels go? The ground state is 10E. First excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E. So the options are looking for the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states. So the numbers would be 10, 15, 20.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. Doesn't fit.

Option B:4E,10E,50E. No.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. Hmm, 10,15,18, which is close.

Option A:30E,39E,50E. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the possible configurations. Maybe the first excited state isn't 15E as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but wait, we have four particles. Let me think: The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2(2). So 10E.

The first excited state would have the next possible higher energy. So perhaps moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. So now you have n=1 (2), n=2(1), n=3(1). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, the next possible configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2(0), n=3(2). So 2 + 0 + 18=20E. So that would be the second excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have n=1 (2), n=3(2). That's 2E + 18E=20E. So the first excited state is 20E, then the next is higher.

But that doesn't fit with the options. Because in the options, the second excited state is 50E in option A, but that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all possible configurations. Another approach: the possible energy levels for four particles would be the sum of the individual energies. The particles must be in the lowest possible states, considering spin.

So the ground state is all four in the lowest possible states. So two in n=1 (each spin), two in n=2 (each spin). So E_total=2*E +2*4E =10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The next possible configuration would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So E_total=2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves up, perhaps: n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. E_total=2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

Wait, but that would make the three energy levels 10E, 15E, 20E. Looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, but 20E is not 18E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but perhaps that leads to a different total energy. Let's calculate again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state isn't when one particle moves, but two move. Wait, the ground state is 10E, and the first excited state would be when two particles are in higher states. For example, two in n=3. So 2*9E=18E, plus two in n=1: 2E. Total 20E. So the first excited state is 20E, and the second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=4, making 2E +2*9E + 2*16E? Wait, that's more than four particles.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct way to fill the states. Another approach: the particles are spin-1/2, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So for four particles, the spatial part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but the spin part must adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but I think the key point is that each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the four particles must occupy the first two spatial states, each with two particles. So the ground state is n=1 (two), n=2 (two) → total energy 10E.

The first excited state would involve having the particles in higher spatial states. But wait, how to move from the ground state to an excited state? The next possible configuration is when one spatial state is higher. So perhaps n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted, perhaps making n=1 (two), n=2 (0), n=3 (two). So the energy would be 2E +0 + 18E=20E.

So the ground, first excited, and second excited states would have energies 10E, 15E, and 20E. But looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is when particles are in n=1 (two), n=3 (two), giving 2E + 18E=20E. So the energies would be 10,15,20. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is 4E,10E,15E. That would imply the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. But that doesn't match what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Let me think again.

Wait, four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D box. Each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, you need to fill the first two spatial states.

n=1: two particles → energy 1²E = E each → total 2E.

n=2: two particles → energy 4E each → total 8E.

Total energy for ground state: 2E +8E =10E.

So ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now you have:

n=1: two → 2E.

n=2: one →4E.

n=3: one →9E.

Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state is when another particle moves to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two.

Energy: 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E.

So the three energies are 10E (ground),15E (first excited),20E (second excited).

Looking at the options, none have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking. The question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E."

Wait, perhaps the ground state is the lowest possible, first excited is the next, etc. So in that case, the ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state is 20E.

But none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the second excited state.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so 2E +4E +16E=22E. No, that's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, so 2E + 18E=20E.

Then the second excited state is when another particle moves to higher states, perhaps n=4 and n=3.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 (so 2*9E=18E), and the remaining two in n=1 (2E). So the total is 20E. So the ground is 10E, first excited is 20E, second excited is higher. But that doesn't fit any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leading to 15E. Then the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, so now you have:

n=1:2E.

n=2: one (4E).

n=3: one (9E).

n=4: one (16E).

Wait, but that would require four particles, so two more: one in n=2, one in n=4. But that's four particles. So energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E =31E. That's higher than 20E, so maybe the second excited state is 31E. But again, none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the energies are 10,15,18.

How can that happen?

Ground state:10E (2E from n=1, 8E from n=2).

First excited state:15E (2E +4E +9E).

Second excited state:18E. How?

18E could be 9E *2. So perhaps two particles in n=3, which is 2 *9E=18E. But then, where are the other two? They would have to be in n=1, so 2E. So total E is 2E + 18E=20E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 (16E), but that would require more particles elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't about moving two particles, but moving one more. Let's see: if in the first excited state we have 15E, then the second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4 from n=2. So n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1. So energy is 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in higher states. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the possible options and see which one makes sense.

The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, option D's numbers are 10,15,18. How can that be achieved?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So for four particles:

n=1:2E (two particles)

n=2:4E (one particle)

n=3:9E (one particle)

Total E=2+4+9=15E.

Then, the second excited state could involve another particle moving to n=4, so:

n=1:2E

n=2:4E

n=3:9E

n=4:16E

But that's four particles: 2+1+1+0? No, wait, we have four particles. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and zero in n=4. Wait, that's only four.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles move to n=3. So n=1:2, n=3:2. So E=2E + 2*9E=20E.

But then the options don't have 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=2. But wait, n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the spin states. For four spin-1/2 particles, the possible spin configurations might allow certain spatial arrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are in the same spatial state but different spin states. But since each spatial state can hold two particles, four particles would require two spatial states, each holding two.

So the ground state is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), giving 10E.

The first excited state would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

The second excited state would be n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So 2E + 2*(16E)=34E. But none of the options have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two of the particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

So E=2E +18E=20E. That would be the first excited state. Then the second excited state is when two are in n=4 and two in n=1:2E + 32E=34E.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, leading to E=15E. Then the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, leading to E=2E + (n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1, n=4 has 1) → but that's three particles, so the fourth must be elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

I'm a bit stuck. Looking at the options, option D is 10,15,18. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would be two particles in n=3 (2*9E=18E), and the other two in n=1 (2E). So 20E total. But that doesn't match 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, second is 18E. How?

Wait, maybe the second excited state isn't about four particles, but perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and the other two in n=2. So n=2:2, n=3:2. So E=2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 15E, which would be the second excited state.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would violate the Pauli exclusion because n=2 can only hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when the spatial part is symmetric, and the spin part is antisymmetric. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4. But that's four particles. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's higher than 18E.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E: These are high, maybe for higher states.

B)4E,10E,50E: Maybe ground state is 4E (n=2?), but no, because four particles in ground state can't be all in n=2.

C)4E,10E,15E: Ground state 4E, maybe n=2 for two particles and n=1 for two? No, because 2E +8E=10E, not 4E.

D)10E,15E,18E: So ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E +18E=20E. But option D says 18E, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So E=2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. But again, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's impossible since n=2 can't hold more than two.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me think about the possible total energies when the particles are in different configurations.

Another approach: The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible spatial states, which is n=1 and n=2. So E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two particles. So E=2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E.

So the three energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps the question is considering the energy levels in a different way, such as considering each particle's energy individually and adding them, but perhaps the levels are filled in a way that the first excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=3.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible, which is n=1 and n=2. So E=10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, so E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is in n=3, making E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct option is option D, 10E,15E,18E, but that doesn't fit my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, making E=2E +4E +9E +16E=31E, which again doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the question is about the energies of the individual particles, but no, the question says the system's energies.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for which option's numbers make sense. For four particles in the ground state, the total energy is 10E.

The first excited state would be when the highest occupied state is n=3, so the total energy is 15E.

The second excited state would then be when the highest is n=4, total energy 27E (2E +4E +9E +16E) for four particles. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So E=2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So E=2E + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How would 18E happen? That would require two particles in n=3 and two in n=1: 2E + 18E=20E. No.

Alternatively, maybe one particle in n=3 and three in n=2? But n=2 can only have two, so that's impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option D: 10E,15E,18E. Because it's the only option where the ground state is 10E, which aligns with what I thought.

But without a clear way to reach 18E, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, the second is 20E, and that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the number of particles. Let me think again.

Four particles: each spatial state can hold two. So ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) →10E.

First excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) →15E.

Second excited: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) →20E.

So the energies are 10,15,20. But no option matches. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the options are misnumbered. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state isn't when two go to n=3, but when one goes to n=4. But that would make the second excited state 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So E=20E, and the ground state is 10E. Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=4: 2E + 2*16E=34E.

But the options don't have that.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options, option D has 10,15,18, which seem sequential, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is 18E, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1, making 20E, which is option B's third option. But no, option B's third is 50E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and the others in lower states. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the spin states.

Wait, perhaps the spin state also contributes to the energy. But no, the spin doesn't affect the energy in this case because the potential is spin-independent. So the energy depends only on the spatial part.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with option D:10E,15E,18E, even though I'm not entirely sure.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in the well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each spatial state \(n\) can hold two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available spatial states.  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=2\): 2 particles, total energy \(2 \cdot 4E = 8E\).  
   Total energy for the ground state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle moves from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\).  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=2\): 1 particle, total energy \(4E\).  
   - \(n=3\): 1 particle, total energy \(9E\).  
   Total energy for the first excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle moves from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), leaving \(n=2\) empty and \(n=3\) with two particles.  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, total energy \(2E\).  
   - \(n=3\): 2 particles, total energy \(2 \cdot 9E = 18E\).  
   Total energy for the second excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are too high and do not match the calculated energies.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect. The ground state energy should be \(10E\), not \(4E\).  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect. The ground state energy should be \(10E\), not \(4E\).  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated ground state (\(10E\)) and first excited state (\(15E\)), but the second excited state is listed as \(18E\), which does not align with the calculated \(20E\). However, this option is the closest to the correct pattern of increasing energies.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the available options, the most reasonable choice is **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**, even though the second excited state energy (\(18E\)) does not perfectly match the calculated value (\(20E\)).
