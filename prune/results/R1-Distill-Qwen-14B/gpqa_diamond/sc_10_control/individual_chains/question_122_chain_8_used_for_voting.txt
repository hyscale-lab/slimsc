Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about each part.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with a product whose NMR spectrum we need to analyze. The goal is to find out how many distinct hydrogen signals there are in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

First, let's break down each reaction step to figure out what each product might be.

1. Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, it's often an acetylation reaction. But wait, bromine is involved here too. Oh right! Pyridine is a base and can help absorb the HBr produced. So, when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, it's esterification, but with bromine, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, bromine (Br2) in such conditions—maybe it's an acetylation followed by some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's the preparation of an acyl bromide. Oh, wait, acetic acid can react with acetic anhydride and Br2 in the presence of pyridine. Acetic anhydride can acetylate the acid. Wait, maybe it's forming an acetyl bromide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the -OH in acetic acid gets replaced by Br. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: acetic anhydride is (Ac)2O. Treatment with H2O would give us two equivalents of acetic acid, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, when acetic anhydride reacts with a base like pyridine, it could form the acylium ion. Oh wait, maybe the reaction is that acetic acid is being converted into acetyl bromide. But wait, is that possible?

Alternatively, I think that when acetic acid is treated with acetic anhydride and Br2 with pyridine, it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, right? Oh wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid. Maybe the reaction is a bromination of the acid. Wait, but where?

Wait, another possibility: since pyridine is a base, it can deprotonate things. Acetic anhydride can act as an acetylating agent. So, perhaps the reaction is acetylation of the hydroxyl group in acetic acid. But wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, and the -OH is on the carboxylic group. When you acetylate that, you form an acetic anhydride derivative? Wait, acetic acid has an -OH, but when you treat it with acetic anhydride and a base, it's typically esterification. For example, if you have an alcohol, acetic anhydride would acetylate it. But in the case of a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific reagents. Bromine (Br2) in pyridine—could this be a bromination? Like, perhaps adding a Br group to the acetic acid molecule. But where? The acetic acid has a CH3 group attached to the COOH. Maybe the methyl group is getting brominated?

Wait, bromination of the methyl group in acetic acid. But how? Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the CH3 group is getting brominated. But I don't think that's likely under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an acyl bromide. Let me think: acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with acetic anhydride (Ac2O) and Br2. Wait, maybe the acid is being converted into an acyl bromide. The reaction could be that the OH of acetic acid is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid + Br2 in the presence of pyridine would produce acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) and HBr. But how does acetic anhydride fit into this?

Wait, perhaps the acetic anhydride is acting as a catalyst or as an acylating agent. Alternatively, maybe the acetic anhydride is used to generate the acylium ion, which then reacts with Br2. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another thought: when acetic anhydride is treated with a base like pyridine, it can form the mixed anhydride. Maybe in the presence of Br2, it could lead to the substitution of the acetic acid's -OH with Br. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetylation followed by a bromination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is replaced by Br. So, the product would be CH3COBr, acetyl bromide. But wait, I thought that typically, to make an acyl bromide, you need something like PBr3 or similar. But maybe under these conditions, it's possible.

So moving forward with that, Product 1 is CH3COBr, acetyl bromide.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat. Another possibility is that the acetic anhydride is acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination of the alpha position. Acetic acid has a CH3 group adjacent to the COOH. Could that CH3 be getting brominated? So, CH3COOH becomes CH2BrCOOH? That would be 2-bromoacetic acid. But under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for other ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid becomes CH3COBr. But wait, that might not be correct because acetic acid is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, thinking again: treating acetic acid with acetic anhydride and pyridine would typically esterify the OH group. But with Br2, perhaps it's a different substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination of the acetic acid's methyl group. But that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a formylation, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an acetylated bromide, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should move on and see if the subsequent steps clarify things.

So, product 1 is then heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.

Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and H2SO4 sounds like an esterification reaction. So, if product 1 is CH3COBr, then reacting with ethanol would produce ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) and HBr. Oh wait, but H2SO4 is a catalyst, so it's acid-catalyzed esterification.

So, product 2 would be ethyl acetate.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.

Sodium cyanide (NaCN) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. So, ethyl acetate has the structure CH3COOEt. If it's treated with CN-, perhaps it's a substitution at the ester. Wait, but CN- is a nucleophile. The ester has a leaving group (the OR), but in this case, maybe it's a transesterification. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the carbonyl group. Wait, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the ester is undergoing some kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. So, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. So, CH3COOEt + CN- → CH3C(O)CN + EtOH? Wait, that would form acetylnitrile (CH3C(O)CN), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis, but with CN-? Hmm.

Wait, actually, when an ester reacts with CN-, perhaps it's a substitution where the OR group is replaced by CN. So, for ethyl acetate, that would give CH3CO-CN, which is acetylnitrile.

Wait, but wait: the structure of ethyl acetate is CH3COOEt. If the oxygen is a leaving group, perhaps CN- replaces the Et-O- group. But esters typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution at the oxygen because the oxygen is not a good leaving group. Unless the leaving group is something else. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis, but under what conditions?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ester is undergoing a reaction to form a nitrile. But how? I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the ester is treated with HCN. Oh wait, in the presence of acid or base, perhaps. But the problem says NaCN is used, so CN- as a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis where the ester is converted into a carboxylic acid, but then maybe the CN- is doing something else. Alternatively, maybe the ester is undergoing a substitution where the ethoxide is replaced by CN. But that requires a good leaving group, which OEt- isn't. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the ester is first converted into an acid under acidic conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structure again. So, product 2 is ethyl acetate. Then, when treated with NaCN, perhaps it's a reaction where the ester group is converted into a nitrile. For that to happen, perhaps the OR group is replaced by CN via a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

In that case, the product would be CH3C(O)CN, which is acetylnitrile. So, product 3 would be acetylnitrile.

Next, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially acidic protons like those on nitriles or amines. But in this case, the nitrile is CH3C(O)CN. Wait, nitriles have protons adjacent to the nitrile group, but in this case, the nitrile is on the carbonyl, so the structure is CH3C(O)CN. So, the alpha protons are on the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the nitrile group is a good electron-withdrawing group, so the alpha protons are acidic. NaH could deprotonate them. Once deprotonated, the resulting anion could perform a nucleophilic substitution.

But the other reagent is 1,5-dibromopentane, which is (CH2Br)CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, it's a dihalide with five carbons in between the two Br atoms. When NaH is present, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by an alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile's alpha position is deprotonated, forming an acylnide (like CH2-), which can then attack an alkylating agent. Wait, but NaH is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton from the nitrile, creating a carbanion, which can then attack the dibromopentane.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a vicinal dihalide. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution, where the nitrile's alpha carbon attacks each Br end, leading to a di-substituted product.

Wait, let me think about the possible reaction. The nitrile (CH3C(O)CN) has an alpha carbon (the CH3). NaH would deprotonate this alpha carbon, forming CH3C(O)C⁻ Na+.

Then, when 1,5-dibromopentane is present, the carbanion could attack one of the Br atoms. For example, the nitrile's carbanion attacks the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to an alkylation. But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has Br on both ends; perhaps it's a di-substitution.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw this out.

The nitrile is CH3C(O)CN. If the alpha H is removed by NaH, we get a carbanion: CH2C(O)CN^(-) Na^+.

Then, when this reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br(CH2)5Br. The carbanion attacks one of the Br atoms. The attack would occur at one end, leading to an alkylation. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two alkyl groups are added.

Wait, perhaps the carbanion will attack each Br in a double substitution. So, the nitrile's alpha carbon would get two alkyl groups, each from the ends of the pentane dihalide.

Wait, but that would require each Br in the dihalide to be replaced by the same carbanion. Hmm, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a symmetrical molecule, so each Br is equivalent.

So, perhaps the nitrile's alpha carbon attacks both Br atoms, leading to the substitution of both Brs and the formation of a geminal di-substituted carbon.

Wait, but that would probably form a quaternary carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH is used to deprotonate the nitrile's alpha position, and the alkyl halide is added twice, leading to an alkylation on each side.

So, in the end, the product would have two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon of the nitrile.

So, let's try to write that structure.

The initial nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After deprotonation and alkylation, the alpha carbon (CH2) would have two pentyl groups attached. So, the structure would be CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but wait: the nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After deprotonation, it's CH2^(-)-C(O)-CN. 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)5Br. When the carbanion attacks, it would substitute each Br, leading to the addition of a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group to each side.

Wait, perhaps the substitution occurs on both Br atoms, leading to the alpha carbon being connected to two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups. So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-O-C≡N

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN? Wait, no, the structure would be:

The nitrile is R-C≡N, and the carbonyl is O=C-O-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, product 3 is CH3CO-CN (acetylnitrile). When treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the alpha carbon (CH3) is deprotonated, forming a carbanion. This carbanion then attacks each bromine in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to two alkyl groups being added to the alpha carbon.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN

Wait, but wait. Let me count the carbons. 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So each substitution would add a five-carbon chain. So the alpha carbon would be connected to two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups. So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN

But wait, the original structure was CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes a C connected to two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that would make the structure:

(CH2)2(CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C(O)-CN.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the connectivity. The alpha carbon (originally CH3) is now attached to two five-carbon chains, each from substitution at each Br. So the structure would be:

(CH2)5CH2- C(O) - CN? No, that can't be right because each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C≡N, but that doesn't include the carbonyl. Or wait, the carbonyl is part of the nitrile group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dialkylation of the nitrile's alpha position. So, the nitrile's alpha carbon (CH2) is connected to two pentyl groups.

So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, no, the O is part of the ketone group. Wait, the initial product 3 is acetylnitrile, which is CH3C(O)CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes C(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2. So the structure would be:

C(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

But that seems a bit off. Let me try to draw it out:

Original structure: CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes C with two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups.

So, the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that would make it a gem-dialkyl nitrile ketone. So the molecule would have a central carbon (the former CH3) connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, that would imply that the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the nitrile. But the carbonyl is a ketone group, so the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Hmm, okay, I think that's the structure. So, product 4 is this gem-dialkyl ketonitrile.

Now, the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

So, I need to figure out the structure of product 4 and then analyze its symmetry to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments.

The structure we've arrived at is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The nitrile is CH3CO-CN, so when the alpha position is deprotonated and alkylated twice, the structure becomes CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but each (C5H11) group is a pentyl chain. So each of the two substituents is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group.

But wait, that would make the structure CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but the exact structure would be:

The central carbon (formerly the CH3 in CH3COCN) is now bonded to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitrile group (CN).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

But wait, that's not exactly correct. Let me correct: the structure would be:

The central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, one carbonyl, and one nitrile group. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes CH2, which is connected to two pentyl groups. So, the structure becomes:

CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that carbon (the former CH3) is now CH2 with two pentyl groups attached. So the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)-CN.

Wait, no, because each substitution adds a pentyl group. So, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, that can't be because the nitrile is attached to the same carbon. Wait, perhaps it's:

The central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl (O=C-), and a nitrile (CN-). So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

So, the molecule is O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, but wait—the nitrile is a substituent on the same carbon as the carbonyl and the two pentyl groups. So, that carbon has four substituents: two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group. Wait, but that's four bonds, so it's a tetrahedral carbon. Hmm.

Wait, that would make the structure:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(C≡N)CO.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again: when the carbanion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, each substitution adds a pentyl group to the alpha carbon. So, the alpha carbon goes from CH3 to CH2 with two pentyl substituents.

So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but wait: no, because the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile group, making four bonds. So it's a central carbon attached to:

- Two pentyl groups (each CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-)
- One carbonyl group (O=C-)
- One nitrile group (CN-)

Wait, but that would require the carbon to have four bonds, which is possible. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Now, to analyze the NMR spectrum, we need to find the number of distinct hydrogen environments.

Let's break down the structure:

1. The two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon are identical because each is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- chain. Since the substituents on the central carbon are symmetric (two identical pentyl groups), the environments of the hydrogens in each pentyl chain would be the same.

2. The carbonyl group (O=C-) is attached to the central carbon, and the nitrile group (CN-) is also attached. But since the central carbon is tetrahedral and has two identical pentyl groups, the molecule may or may not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents on either side of the central carbon are mirror images. Since the two pentyl groups are identical, and the other two substituents (O=C- and CN-) are different, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the O=C and CN are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical if the groups are arranged such that each substituent is mirrored.

Wait, but the O=C and CN- are different, so the central carbon would have two identical pentyl groups, one O=C, and one CN group. So, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because O=C and CN are not the same. Wait, but wait: the central carbon has four substituents: two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (O=C-), and a nitrile group (CN-). So, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to the central carbon if the O=C and CN are on opposite sides, but they are different groups, so perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, but the two pentyl groups are identical, but the other two substituents are different. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbon, making the structure symmetrical. Because the two pentyl groups are the same, and the other two substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, leading to some equivalent protons.

Now, let's visualize the structure:

The central carbon (C) is connected to:

- Two identical pentyl groups (A and A')
- One carbonyl group (O=C)
- One nitrile group (CN)

So, the molecule is symmetrical across the plane that bisects the central carbon, making the two pentyl groups mirror images of each other. Therefore, any protons in the pentyl groups that are in equivalent positions due to this symmetry would be equivalent, leading to the same chemical shift.

Now, let's analyze the hydrogen environments in each part of the molecule.

First, the central pentyl groups.

Each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons. Let's number each pentyl group from the point of attachment to the central carbon:

The pentyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, when the central carbon (former alpha carbon) attacks each Br, each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a five-carbon chain attached to the central carbon.

Wait, no. 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. So, each substitution replaces a Br with the carbanion, adding a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group. So, the pentyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- attached to the central carbon.

So, each pentyl group is -(CH2)5- attached to the central carbon.

Wait, no. Because the pentyl group is -(CH2)4-CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br? No, wait, 1,5-dibromopentane would be BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each substitution would add a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. But that's a six-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 1,5-dibromopentane would be BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each substitution would replace each Br with a bond to the central carbon. So, each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group, but that's a five-carbon chain, making the structure:

Central carbon connected to two -(CH2)5- groups. Wait, no, because each substitution is adding a -(CH2)4-CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a -(CH2)4-CH3 group. So, the pentyl substituent is -(CH2)4-CH3.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a -(CH2)4-CH3 group to the central carbon. So, the structure would be:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)2.

So, each pentyl substituent is -(CH2)4-CH3.

Now, considering the structure, the two pentyl groups are identical, so their protons would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule.

Now, let's analyze the NMR signals:

1. The hydrogens on the central carbon: but wait, the central carbon is connected to the O=C, CN, and two pentyl groups. So, the central carbon has no hydrogens attached because all four bonds are to substituents. So, no hydrogens there.

2. The pentyl groups: each is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 chain attached to the central carbon.

But because the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetrical, the hydrogens in each position of the pentyl groups will have equivalent environments.

Wait, but let's consider the symmetry. Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain. Let's think about the symmetry. Since the two pentyl groups are attached symmetrically to the central carbon, any protons that are in equivalent positions in each chain will be equivalent.

But wait, perhaps the symmetry is such that the two pentyl groups are mirror images. Therefore, the protons in each position of the pentyl groups are equivalent.

Let me break down the hydrogen environments in a single pentyl group:

In a single -(CH2)4-CH3 chain:

- The first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) has two hydrogens.
- The second CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The third CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The fourth CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The terminal CH3 has three hydrogens.

But due to the symmetry of the molecule, the first CH2 on each pentyl group (the one attached to the central carbon) will have equivalent hydrogens. Similarly, the second CH2 on each pentyl group will have equivalent hydrogens, and so on.

Wait, but wait: the central carbon is connected to two identical pentyl groups, which are symmetrical. So, the first CH2 groups on each pentyl chain (attached to the central carbon) are equivalent. The second CH2 groups are each attached to a CH2 that's attached to the central carbon, so their environments are the same. Similarly for the third and fourth CH2 groups, and the terminal CH3 groups.

But wait, the terminal CH3 groups are at the end of each pentyl chain, so they're in the same environment on each side. Thus, their protons would be equivalent.

So, within each pentyl group, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) has two equivalent H's. The second CH2 has two equivalent H's, and so on.

But wait, in the entire molecule, the two pentyl groups are symmetric. So, any H's in the same position in each pentyl group are equivalent. For example, the first CH2 on each pentyl group will have the same chemical environment, leading to a single signal for all four H's (two from each CH2 group). Wait, no, because each CH2 group has two H's, and there are two such groups, but they are equivalent, so all four H's would be a single peak.

Wait, but in reality, each CH2 group (like the first CH2) has two H's, and each of the two pentyl groups has such a CH2. But since the two CH2 groups are in the same environment due to symmetry, their H's are equivalent, so they would contribute to the same peak.

So, for each CH2 in the pentyl chain, the H's would be equivalent across both pentyl groups.

So, let's count the distinct H environments in the molecule:

a) The first CH2 group (attached to the central carbon) in each pentyl chain: 2 H's, but because there are two identical pentyl groups, all four H's are equivalent. So, one signal.

b) The second CH2 group in each pentyl chain: another set of H's. Again, two CH2 groups, each with two H's, so four H's, but equivalent → one signal.

c) The third CH2 group: same as above → one signal.

d) The fourth CH2 group: same → one signal.

e) The terminal CH3 groups at the end of each pentyl chain: two CH3 groups, each with three H's. But due to symmetry, their H's are equivalent → one signal.

Additionally, are there any other H's? The nitrile group (CN-) doesn't have any H's, and the carbonyl group (O=C-) is a double bond, so no H's there.

Now, that's five signals from the pentyl groups. But wait, let me recount:

- First CH2: one signal (intensity 4H)
- Second CH2: one signal (4H)
- Third CH2: one signal (4H)
- Fourth CH2: one signal (4H)
- Terminal CH3: one signal (6H)

Wait, wait a minute. Each pentyl group has four CH2 groups and one CH3. So, each CH2 group has two H's, so two from each CH2 in both pentyl groups would sum to four H's, but as they're equivalent, each contributes as a single peak.

Wait, but wait: the first CH2 is -(CH2)- attached to the central carbon. Each pentyl group has one such CH2, so two in total, each with two H's. Because of symmetry, all four H's are equivalent → one peak.

Similarly for the second CH2, which is attached to the first CH2. Each pentyl group has a second CH2. So, two CH2 groups, each with two H's → four H's, but same environment → one peak.

Same for the third and fourth CH2 groups.

The terminal CH3 is at the end of each pentyl group. Each CH3 has three H's, and there are two CH3 groups. But due to symmetry, all six H's are equivalent → one peak.

So, that's five signals from the pentyl groups.

But wait, in reality, each CH2 in the pentyl chain might have a different environment. For example, the first CH2 is next to the central carbon, which is attached to O=C and CN. The second CH2 is next to the first CH2, and so on. So, each CH2 group in the pentyl chain would have a different chemical shift.

So, the first CH2 group (closest to the central carbon) would have a different shift than the second, third, and fourth. The terminal CH3 would also have a different shift.

So, in the pentyl groups, we would have:

- First CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Second CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Third CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Fourth CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Terminal CH3: 6 H's → one signal

That's five signals from the pentyl groups.

Additionally, are there any other H's in the molecule? Let's check.

The central carbon has O=C and CN substituents, but no H's attached.

Are there any other H's in the molecule? Not that I can see.

So, the total number of signals would be five.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The O=C is a ketone group, which is adjacent to the central carbon. The CN is a nitrile group. Could the presence of these electron-withdrawing groups affect the chemical shifts of adjacent protons?

But in our case, the adjacent protons are in the pentyl chains, so each CH2 group is further away from the O=C and CN groups.

Wait, but the first CH2 group is directly attached to the central carbon, which is attached to O=C and CN. The other CH2 groups are further away. So, their chemical shifts would be different.

So, each CH2 group in the pentyl chain would have a different chemical shift, leading to a separate signal for each.

Thus, the five signals from the pentyl groups contribute five distinct signals.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again: in an alkyl chain, each CH2 group is a certain distance from an electronegative group, which affects the chemical shift. So, in a symmetrical molecule, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) would have a unique shift, the second would have another, etc.

But wait, in a symmetrical molecule like this, the first and second CH2 groups are in the same environment in both pentyl chains, so their shifts would be the same across all four H's.

Wait, but if the central carbon has O=C and CN groups, which are not symmetrical, then the two pentyl groups are mirror images, but the substituents on the central carbon are not symmetrical. So, the two pentyl groups are in the same environment, but the substituents on the central carbon may cause the CH2 groups to have different shifts as you move away from the central carbon.

But for the purpose of NMR, each set of equivalent H's would give a single peak, regardless of the substituents elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it step by step.

In the molecule, each pentyl group is identical, so each CH2 group in the same position in each pentyl group will have the same environment, leading to the same chemical shift.

So, for each of the five CH2 and CH3 groups in the pentyl chain, we have the following:

1. The first CH2 (attached to the central carbon): two H's per CH2, two CH2 groups → four H's, same shift → one peak.
2. The second CH2: same → one peak.
3. The third CH2: same → one peak.
4. The fourth CH2: same → one peak.
5. The terminal CH3: two CH3 groups, six H's, same shift → one peak.

So, that's five signals.

But wait, I'm getting five, but the options don't have five as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, option B is 5. So, perhaps the answer is 5.

But I'm not entirely sure because maybe I'm missing something in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different, leading to more signals.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine the reaction steps.

The initial step: acetic acid is treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. Could this be a substitution where the -OH of acetic acid is replaced by Br, forming CH3COBr (acetyl bromide)?

Then, product 1 is CH3COBr. Heating with ethanol and H2SO4 would esterify it, producing ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) and HBr. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Then, product 2 is treated with NaCN. Could this be a hydrolysis under acidic conditions to a carboxylic acid, which then reacts with CN-? Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the ethoxide in the ester is replaced by CN, forming CH3CO-CN (acetylnitrile).

So, product 3 is acetylnitrile.

Then, product 3 is treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH deprotonates the alpha position (CH3 group) of the nitrile, forming a carbanion, which reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. Each Br is replaced by the carbanion, leading to a di-substitution. So, the structure becomes (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group.

In this structure, the two pentyl groups are identical, leading to symmetry in the molecule. So, the pentyl chains are symmetric, leading to certain H's being equivalent.

So, let's analyze the H's in this structure.

The molecule is O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Now, the central C is attached to:

- Two -(CH2)5- groups (each pentyl)
- O=C
- CN

Wait, but wait: (CH2)5- would be a five-carbon chain? No, (CH2)5 would be five CH2 groups, making a six-carbon chain. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)4CH3, which is a pentyl group. So, each substituent is -(CH2)4CH3.

So, each pentyl group is -(CH2)4CH3.

Now, each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons: -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Each CH2 group in the pentyl chain has two H's, except the terminal CH3, which has three.

Now, due to the molecule's symmetry, the two pentyl groups are identical, so their H's will be equivalent.

So, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) in each pentyl group has two H's. Since there are two pentyl groups, that's four H's, but all in the same environment → one peak.

The second CH2 in each pentyl group has two H's → four H's, same environment → one peak.

The third CH2 → same → one peak.

The fourth CH2 → same → one peak.

The terminal CH3 in each pentyl group has three H's → two CH3 groups, six H's, same environment → one peak.

So, that's five signals from the pentyl groups.

Additionally, are there any other H's? The central carbon has no H's, and the nitrile and carbonyl groups don't contribute H's.

So, total of five signals.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5. So, the answer should be B)5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with a product whose 1H NMR spectrum is analyzed to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1**: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This reaction forms acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr), where the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is replaced by bromine.

2. **Reaction 2**: Acetyl bromide is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. This is an esterification reaction, producing ethyl acetate (CH₃COOEt).

3. **Reaction 3**: Ethyl acetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where the ethoxy group (-OEt) is replaced by a cyano group (-CN), forming acetylnitrile (CH₃C(O)CN).

4. **Reaction 4**: Acetylnitrile is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha carbon (CH₃ group) of acetylnitrile, forming a carbanion. This carbanion undergoes two nucleophilic substitutions with 1,5-dibromopentane, resulting in a gem-dialkylation. The final product is a molecule where the alpha carbon is attached to two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitrile group (CN). The structure of the final product is **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)₂C(O)CN**.

### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product
The final product has two identical pentyl groups attached to the central carbon. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the hydrogens in equivalent positions across the two pentyl groups will have the same chemical shift. The pentyl groups contribute the following distinct hydrogen environments:

1. **First CH₂ group (attached to the central carbon)**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups across the two pentyl chains → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
2. **Second CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
3. **Third CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
4. **Fourth CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
5. **Terminal CH₃ group**: Three hydrogens per CH₃, with two equivalent CH₃ groups → 6 hydrogens, one signal.

Thus, the pentyl groups contribute **5 distinct hydrogen signals**. The central carbon and the nitrile and carbonyl groups do not contribute additional hydrogens.

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product is **5**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about each part.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with a product whose NMR spectrum we need to analyze. The goal is to find out how many distinct hydrogen signals there are in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

First, let's break down each reaction step to figure out what each product might be.

1. Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, it's often an acetylation reaction. But wait, bromine is involved here too. Oh right! Pyridine is a base and can help absorb the HBr produced. So, when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, it's esterification, but with bromine, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, bromine (Br2) in such conditions—maybe it's an acetylation followed by some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's the preparation of an acyl bromide. Oh, wait, acetic acid can react with acetic anhydride and Br2 in the presence of pyridine. Acetic anhydride can acetylate the acid. Wait, maybe it's forming an acetyl bromide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the -OH in acetic acid gets replaced by Br. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: acetic anhydride is (Ac)2O. Treatment with H2O would give us two equivalents of acetic acid, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, when acetic anhydride reacts with a base like pyridine, it could form the acylium ion. Oh wait, maybe the reaction is that acetic acid is being converted into acetyl bromide. But wait, is that possible?

Alternatively, I think that when acetic acid is treated with acetic anhydride and Br2 with pyridine, it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, right? Oh wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid. Maybe the reaction is a bromination of the acid. Wait, but where?

Wait, another possibility: since pyridine is a base, it can deprotonate things. Acetic anhydride can act as an acetylating agent. So, perhaps the reaction is acetylation of the hydroxyl group in acetic acid. But wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, and the -OH is on the carboxylic group. When you acetylate that, you form an acetic anhydride derivative? Wait, acetic acid has an -OH, but when you treat it with acetic anhydride and a base, it's typically esterification. For example, if you have an alcohol, acetic anhydride would acetylate it. But in the case of a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific reagents. Bromine (Br2) in pyridine—could this be a bromination? Like, perhaps adding a Br group to the acetic acid molecule. But where? The acetic acid has a CH3 group attached to the COOH. Maybe the methyl group is getting brominated?

Wait, bromination of the methyl group in acetic acid. But how? Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the CH3 group is getting brominated. But I don't think that's likely under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an acyl bromide. Let me think: acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with acetic anhydride (Ac2O) and Br2. Wait, maybe the acid is being converted into an acyl bromide. The reaction could be that the OH of acetic acid is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid + Br2 in the presence of pyridine would produce acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) and HBr. But how does acetic anhydride fit into this?

Wait, perhaps the acetic anhydride is acting as a catalyst or as an acylating agent. Alternatively, maybe the acetic anhydride is used to generate the acylium ion, which then reacts with Br2. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another thought: when acetic anhydride is treated with a base like pyridine, it can form the mixed anhydride. Maybe in the presence of Br2, it could lead to the substitution of the acetic acid's -OH with Br. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetylation followed by a bromination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is replaced by Br. So, the product would be CH3COBr, acetyl bromide. But wait, I thought that typically, to make an acyl bromide, you need something like PBr3 or similar. But maybe under these conditions, it's possible.

So moving forward with that, Product 1 is CH3COBr, acetyl bromide.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat. Another possibility is that the acetic anhydride is acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination of the alpha position. Acetic acid has a CH3 group adjacent to the COOH. Could that CH3 be getting brominated? So, CH3COOH becomes CH2BrCOOH? That would be 2-bromoacetic acid. But under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for other ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid becomes CH3COBr. But wait, that might not be correct because acetic acid is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, thinking again: treating acetic acid with acetic anhydride and pyridine would typically esterify the OH group. But with Br2, perhaps it's a different substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination of the acetic acid's methyl group. But that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a formylation, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an acetylated bromide, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should move on and see if the subsequent steps clarify things.

So, product 1 is then heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.

Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and H2SO4 sounds like an esterification reaction. So, if product 1 is CH3COBr, then reacting with ethanol would produce ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) and HBr. Oh wait, but H2SO4 is a catalyst, so it's acid-catalyzed esterification.

So, product 2 would be ethyl acetate.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.

Sodium cyanide (NaCN) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. So, ethyl acetate has the structure CH3COOEt. If it's treated with CN-, perhaps it's a substitution at the ester. Wait, but CN- is a nucleophile. The ester has a leaving group (the OR), but in this case, maybe it's a transesterification. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the carbonyl group. Wait, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the ester is undergoing some kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. So, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. So, CH3COOEt + CN- → CH3C(O)CN + EtOH? Wait, that would form acetylnitrile (CH3C(O)CN), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis, but with CN-? Hmm.

Wait, actually, when an ester reacts with CN-, perhaps it's a substitution where the OR group is replaced by CN. So, for ethyl acetate, that would give CH3CO-CN, which is acetylnitrile.

Wait, but wait: the structure of ethyl acetate is CH3COOEt. If the oxygen is a leaving group, perhaps CN- replaces the Et-O- group. But esters typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution at the oxygen because the oxygen is not a good leaving group. Unless the leaving group is something else. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis, but under what conditions?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ester is undergoing a reaction to form a nitrile. But how? I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the ester is treated with HCN. Oh wait, in the presence of acid or base, perhaps. But the problem says NaCN is used, so CN- as a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis where the ester is converted into a carboxylic acid, but then maybe the CN- is doing something else. Alternatively, maybe the ester is undergoing a substitution where the ethoxide is replaced by CN. But that requires a good leaving group, which OEt- isn't. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the ester is first converted into an acid under acidic conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structure again. So, product 2 is ethyl acetate. Then, when treated with NaCN, perhaps it's a reaction where the ester group is converted into a nitrile. For that to happen, perhaps the OR group is replaced by CN via a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

In that case, the product would be CH3C(O)CN, which is acetylnitrile. So, product 3 would be acetylnitrile.

Next, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4.

Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially acidic protons like those on nitriles or amines. But in this case, the nitrile is CH3C(O)CN. Wait, nitriles have protons adjacent to the nitrile group, but in this case, the nitrile is on the carbonyl, so the structure is CH3C(O)CN. So, the alpha protons are on the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the nitrile group is a good electron-withdrawing group, so the alpha protons are acidic. NaH could deprotonate them. Once deprotonated, the resulting anion could perform a nucleophilic substitution.

But the other reagent is 1,5-dibromopentane, which is (CH2Br)CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, it's a dihalide with five carbons in between the two Br atoms. When NaH is present, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by an alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile's alpha position is deprotonated, forming an acylnide (like CH2-), which can then attack an alkylating agent. Wait, but NaH is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton from the nitrile, creating a carbanion, which can then attack the dibromopentane.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a vicinal dihalide. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution, where the nitrile's alpha carbon attacks each Br end, leading to a di-substituted product.

Wait, let me think about the possible reaction. The nitrile (CH3C(O)CN) has an alpha carbon (the CH3). NaH would deprotonate this alpha carbon, forming CH3C(O)C⁻ Na+.

Then, when 1,5-dibromopentane is present, the carbanion could attack one of the Br atoms. For example, the nitrile's carbanion attacks the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to an alkylation. But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has Br on both ends; perhaps it's a di-substitution.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw this out.

The nitrile is CH3C(O)CN. If the alpha H is removed by NaH, we get a carbanion: CH2C(O)CN^(-) Na^+.

Then, when this reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br(CH2)5Br. The carbanion attacks one of the Br atoms. The attack would occur at one end, leading to an alkylation. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two alkyl groups are added.

Wait, perhaps the carbanion will attack each Br in a double substitution. So, the nitrile's alpha carbon would get two alkyl groups, each from the ends of the pentane dihalide.

Wait, but that would require each Br in the dihalide to be replaced by the same carbanion. Hmm, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a symmetrical molecule, so each Br is equivalent.

So, perhaps the nitrile's alpha carbon attacks both Br atoms, leading to the substitution of both Brs and the formation of a geminal di-substituted carbon.

Wait, but that would probably form a quaternary carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH is used to deprotonate the nitrile's alpha position, and the alkyl halide is added twice, leading to an alkylation on each side.

So, in the end, the product would have two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon of the nitrile.

So, let's try to write that structure.

The initial nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After deprotonation and alkylation, the alpha carbon (CH2) would have two pentyl groups attached. So, the structure would be CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but wait: the nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After deprotonation, it's CH2^(-)-C(O)-CN. 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)5Br. When the carbanion attacks, it would substitute each Br, leading to the addition of a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group to each side.

Wait, perhaps the substitution occurs on both Br atoms, leading to the alpha carbon being connected to two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups. So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-O-C≡N

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN? Wait, no, the structure would be:

The nitrile is R-C≡N, and the carbonyl is O=C-O-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, product 3 is CH3CO-CN (acetylnitrile). When treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the alpha carbon (CH3) is deprotonated, forming a carbanion. This carbanion then attacks each bromine in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to two alkyl groups being added to the alpha carbon.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN

Wait, but wait. Let me count the carbons. 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So each substitution would add a five-carbon chain. So the alpha carbon would be connected to two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups. So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN

But wait, the original structure was CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes a C connected to two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that would make the structure:

(CH2)2(CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C(O)-CN.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the connectivity. The alpha carbon (originally CH3) is now attached to two five-carbon chains, each from substitution at each Br. So the structure would be:

(CH2)5CH2- C(O) - CN? No, that can't be right because each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C≡N, but that doesn't include the carbonyl. Or wait, the carbonyl is part of the nitrile group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dialkylation of the nitrile's alpha position. So, the nitrile's alpha carbon (CH2) is connected to two pentyl groups.

So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, no, the O is part of the ketone group. Wait, the initial product 3 is acetylnitrile, which is CH3C(O)CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes C(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2. So the structure would be:

C(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

But that seems a bit off. Let me try to draw it out:

Original structure: CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes C with two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups.

So, the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that would make it a gem-dialkyl nitrile ketone. So the molecule would have a central carbon (the former CH3) connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, that would imply that the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the nitrile. But the carbonyl is a ketone group, so the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Hmm, okay, I think that's the structure. So, product 4 is this gem-dialkyl ketonitrile.

Now, the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

So, I need to figure out the structure of product 4 and then analyze its symmetry to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments.

The structure we've arrived at is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The nitrile is CH3CO-CN, so when the alpha position is deprotonated and alkylated twice, the structure becomes CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but each (C5H11) group is a pentyl chain. So each of the two substituents is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group.

But wait, that would make the structure CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but the exact structure would be:

The central carbon (formerly the CH3 in CH3COCN) is now bonded to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitrile group (CN).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

But wait, that's not exactly correct. Let me correct: the structure would be:

The central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, one carbonyl, and one nitrile group. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial nitrile is CH3-C(O)-CN. After substitution, the CH3 becomes CH2, which is connected to two pentyl groups. So, the structure becomes:

CH2(C5H11)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but that carbon (the former CH3) is now CH2 with two pentyl groups attached. So the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)-CN.

Wait, no, because each substitution adds a pentyl group. So, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, that can't be because the nitrile is attached to the same carbon. Wait, perhaps it's:

The central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl (O=C-), and a nitrile (CN-). So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

So, the molecule is O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, but wait—the nitrile is a substituent on the same carbon as the carbonyl and the two pentyl groups. So, that carbon has four substituents: two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group. Wait, but that's four bonds, so it's a tetrahedral carbon. Hmm.

Wait, that would make the structure:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(C≡N)CO.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again: when the carbanion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, each substitution adds a pentyl group to the alpha carbon. So, the alpha carbon goes from CH3 to CH2 with two pentyl substituents.

So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but wait: no, because the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile group, making four bonds. So it's a central carbon attached to:

- Two pentyl groups (each CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-)
- One carbonyl group (O=C-)
- One nitrile group (CN-)

Wait, but that would require the carbon to have four bonds, which is possible. So, the structure is:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Now, to analyze the NMR spectrum, we need to find the number of distinct hydrogen environments.

Let's break down the structure:

1. The two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon are identical because each is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- chain. Since the substituents on the central carbon are symmetric (two identical pentyl groups), the environments of the hydrogens in each pentyl chain would be the same.

2. The carbonyl group (O=C-) is attached to the central carbon, and the nitrile group (CN-) is also attached. But since the central carbon is tetrahedral and has two identical pentyl groups, the molecule may or may not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents on either side of the central carbon are mirror images. Since the two pentyl groups are identical, and the other two substituents (O=C- and CN-) are different, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the O=C and CN are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical if the groups are arranged such that each substituent is mirrored.

Wait, but the O=C and CN- are different, so the central carbon would have two identical pentyl groups, one O=C, and one CN group. So, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because O=C and CN are not the same. Wait, but wait: the central carbon has four substituents: two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (O=C-), and a nitrile group (CN-). So, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to the central carbon if the O=C and CN are on opposite sides, but they are different groups, so perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, but the two pentyl groups are identical, but the other two substituents are different. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbon, making the structure symmetrical. Because the two pentyl groups are the same, and the other two substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, leading to some equivalent protons.

Now, let's visualize the structure:

The central carbon (C) is connected to:

- Two identical pentyl groups (A and A')
- One carbonyl group (O=C)
- One nitrile group (CN)

So, the molecule is symmetrical across the plane that bisects the central carbon, making the two pentyl groups mirror images of each other. Therefore, any protons in the pentyl groups that are in equivalent positions due to this symmetry would be equivalent, leading to the same chemical shift.

Now, let's analyze the hydrogen environments in each part of the molecule.

First, the central pentyl groups.

Each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons. Let's number each pentyl group from the point of attachment to the central carbon:

The pentyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, when the central carbon (former alpha carbon) attacks each Br, each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a five-carbon chain attached to the central carbon.

Wait, no. 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. So, each substitution replaces a Br with the carbanion, adding a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group. So, the pentyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- attached to the central carbon.

So, each pentyl group is -(CH2)5- attached to the central carbon.

Wait, no. Because the pentyl group is -(CH2)4-CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br? No, wait, 1,5-dibromopentane would be BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each substitution would add a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. But that's a six-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 1,5-dibromopentane would be BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each substitution would replace each Br with a bond to the central carbon. So, each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group, but that's a five-carbon chain, making the structure:

Central carbon connected to two -(CH2)5- groups. Wait, no, because each substitution is adding a -(CH2)4-CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a -(CH2)4-CH3 group. So, the pentyl substituent is -(CH2)4-CH3.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a -(CH2)4-CH3 group to the central carbon. So, the structure would be:

O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)2.

So, each pentyl substituent is -(CH2)4-CH3.

Now, considering the structure, the two pentyl groups are identical, so their protons would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule.

Now, let's analyze the NMR signals:

1. The hydrogens on the central carbon: but wait, the central carbon is connected to the O=C, CN, and two pentyl groups. So, the central carbon has no hydrogens attached because all four bonds are to substituents. So, no hydrogens there.

2. The pentyl groups: each is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 chain attached to the central carbon.

But because the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetrical, the hydrogens in each position of the pentyl groups will have equivalent environments.

Wait, but let's consider the symmetry. Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain. Let's think about the symmetry. Since the two pentyl groups are attached symmetrically to the central carbon, any protons that are in equivalent positions in each chain will be equivalent.

But wait, perhaps the symmetry is such that the two pentyl groups are mirror images. Therefore, the protons in each position of the pentyl groups are equivalent.

Let me break down the hydrogen environments in a single pentyl group:

In a single -(CH2)4-CH3 chain:

- The first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) has two hydrogens.
- The second CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The third CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The fourth CH2 has two hydrogens.
- The terminal CH3 has three hydrogens.

But due to the symmetry of the molecule, the first CH2 on each pentyl group (the one attached to the central carbon) will have equivalent hydrogens. Similarly, the second CH2 on each pentyl group will have equivalent hydrogens, and so on.

Wait, but wait: the central carbon is connected to two identical pentyl groups, which are symmetrical. So, the first CH2 groups on each pentyl chain (attached to the central carbon) are equivalent. The second CH2 groups are each attached to a CH2 that's attached to the central carbon, so their environments are the same. Similarly for the third and fourth CH2 groups, and the terminal CH3 groups.

But wait, the terminal CH3 groups are at the end of each pentyl chain, so they're in the same environment on each side. Thus, their protons would be equivalent.

So, within each pentyl group, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) has two equivalent H's. The second CH2 has two equivalent H's, and so on.

But wait, in the entire molecule, the two pentyl groups are symmetric. So, any H's in the same position in each pentyl group are equivalent. For example, the first CH2 on each pentyl group will have the same chemical environment, leading to a single signal for all four H's (two from each CH2 group). Wait, no, because each CH2 group has two H's, and there are two such groups, but they are equivalent, so all four H's would be a single peak.

Wait, but in reality, each CH2 group (like the first CH2) has two H's, and each of the two pentyl groups has such a CH2. But since the two CH2 groups are in the same environment due to symmetry, their H's are equivalent, so they would contribute to the same peak.

So, for each CH2 in the pentyl chain, the H's would be equivalent across both pentyl groups.

So, let's count the distinct H environments in the molecule:

a) The first CH2 group (attached to the central carbon) in each pentyl chain: 2 H's, but because there are two identical pentyl groups, all four H's are equivalent. So, one signal.

b) The second CH2 group in each pentyl chain: another set of H's. Again, two CH2 groups, each with two H's, so four H's, but equivalent → one signal.

c) The third CH2 group: same as above → one signal.

d) The fourth CH2 group: same → one signal.

e) The terminal CH3 groups at the end of each pentyl chain: two CH3 groups, each with three H's. But due to symmetry, their H's are equivalent → one signal.

Additionally, are there any other H's? The nitrile group (CN-) doesn't have any H's, and the carbonyl group (O=C-) is a double bond, so no H's there.

Now, that's five signals from the pentyl groups. But wait, let me recount:

- First CH2: one signal (intensity 4H)
- Second CH2: one signal (4H)
- Third CH2: one signal (4H)
- Fourth CH2: one signal (4H)
- Terminal CH3: one signal (6H)

Wait, wait a minute. Each pentyl group has four CH2 groups and one CH3. So, each CH2 group has two H's, so two from each CH2 in both pentyl groups would sum to four H's, but as they're equivalent, each contributes as a single peak.

Wait, but wait: the first CH2 is -(CH2)- attached to the central carbon. Each pentyl group has one such CH2, so two in total, each with two H's. Because of symmetry, all four H's are equivalent → one peak.

Similarly for the second CH2, which is attached to the first CH2. Each pentyl group has a second CH2. So, two CH2 groups, each with two H's → four H's, but same environment → one peak.

Same for the third and fourth CH2 groups.

The terminal CH3 is at the end of each pentyl group. Each CH3 has three H's, and there are two CH3 groups. But due to symmetry, all six H's are equivalent → one peak.

So, that's five signals from the pentyl groups.

But wait, in reality, each CH2 in the pentyl chain might have a different environment. For example, the first CH2 is next to the central carbon, which is attached to O=C and CN. The second CH2 is next to the first CH2, and so on. So, each CH2 group in the pentyl chain would have a different chemical shift.

So, the first CH2 group (closest to the central carbon) would have a different shift than the second, third, and fourth. The terminal CH3 would also have a different shift.

So, in the pentyl groups, we would have:

- First CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Second CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Third CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Fourth CH2: 4 H's → one signal
- Terminal CH3: 6 H's → one signal

That's five signals from the pentyl groups.

Additionally, are there any other H's in the molecule? Let's check.

The central carbon has O=C and CN substituents, but no H's attached.

Are there any other H's in the molecule? Not that I can see.

So, the total number of signals would be five.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The O=C is a ketone group, which is adjacent to the central carbon. The CN is a nitrile group. Could the presence of these electron-withdrawing groups affect the chemical shifts of adjacent protons?

But in our case, the adjacent protons are in the pentyl chains, so each CH2 group is further away from the O=C and CN groups.

Wait, but the first CH2 group is directly attached to the central carbon, which is attached to O=C and CN. The other CH2 groups are further away. So, their chemical shifts would be different.

So, each CH2 group in the pentyl chain would have a different chemical shift, leading to a separate signal for each.

Thus, the five signals from the pentyl groups contribute five distinct signals.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again: in an alkyl chain, each CH2 group is a certain distance from an electronegative group, which affects the chemical shift. So, in a symmetrical molecule, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) would have a unique shift, the second would have another, etc.

But wait, in a symmetrical molecule like this, the first and second CH2 groups are in the same environment in both pentyl chains, so their shifts would be the same across all four H's.

Wait, but if the central carbon has O=C and CN groups, which are not symmetrical, then the two pentyl groups are mirror images, but the substituents on the central carbon are not symmetrical. So, the two pentyl groups are in the same environment, but the substituents on the central carbon may cause the CH2 groups to have different shifts as you move away from the central carbon.

But for the purpose of NMR, each set of equivalent H's would give a single peak, regardless of the substituents elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it step by step.

In the molecule, each pentyl group is identical, so each CH2 group in the same position in each pentyl group will have the same environment, leading to the same chemical shift.

So, for each of the five CH2 and CH3 groups in the pentyl chain, we have the following:

1. The first CH2 (attached to the central carbon): two H's per CH2, two CH2 groups → four H's, same shift → one peak.
2. The second CH2: same → one peak.
3. The third CH2: same → one peak.
4. The fourth CH2: same → one peak.
5. The terminal CH3: two CH3 groups, six H's, same shift → one peak.

So, that's five signals.

But wait, I'm getting five, but the options don't have five as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, option B is 5. So, perhaps the answer is 5.

But I'm not entirely sure because maybe I'm missing something in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different, leading to more signals.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine the reaction steps.

The initial step: acetic acid is treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. Could this be a substitution where the -OH of acetic acid is replaced by Br, forming CH3COBr (acetyl bromide)?

Then, product 1 is CH3COBr. Heating with ethanol and H2SO4 would esterify it, producing ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) and HBr. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Then, product 2 is treated with NaCN. Could this be a hydrolysis under acidic conditions to a carboxylic acid, which then reacts with CN-? Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the ethoxide in the ester is replaced by CN, forming CH3CO-CN (acetylnitrile).

So, product 3 is acetylnitrile.

Then, product 3 is treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH deprotonates the alpha position (CH3 group) of the nitrile, forming a carbanion, which reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. Each Br is replaced by the carbanion, leading to a di-substitution. So, the structure becomes (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a nitrile group.

In this structure, the two pentyl groups are identical, leading to symmetry in the molecule. So, the pentyl chains are symmetric, leading to certain H's being equivalent.

So, let's analyze the H's in this structure.

The molecule is O=C-C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Now, the central C is attached to:

- Two -(CH2)5- groups (each pentyl)
- O=C
- CN

Wait, but wait: (CH2)5- would be a five-carbon chain? No, (CH2)5 would be five CH2 groups, making a six-carbon chain. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)4CH3, which is a pentyl group. So, each substituent is -(CH2)4CH3.

So, each pentyl group is -(CH2)4CH3.

Now, each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons: -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Each CH2 group in the pentyl chain has two H's, except the terminal CH3, which has three.

Now, due to the molecule's symmetry, the two pentyl groups are identical, so their H's will be equivalent.

So, the first CH2 (attached to the central carbon) in each pentyl group has two H's. Since there are two pentyl groups, that's four H's, but all in the same environment → one peak.

The second CH2 in each pentyl group has two H's → four H's, same environment → one peak.

The third CH2 → same → one peak.

The fourth CH2 → same → one peak.

The terminal CH3 in each pentyl group has three H's → two CH3 groups, six H's, same environment → one peak.

So, that's five signals from the pentyl groups.

Additionally, are there any other H's? The central carbon has no H's, and the nitrile and carbonyl groups don't contribute H's.

So, total of five signals.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5. So, the answer should be B)5.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with a product whose 1H NMR spectrum is analyzed to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1**: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This reaction forms acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr), where the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is replaced by bromine.

2. **Reaction 2**: Acetyl bromide is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. This is an esterification reaction, producing ethyl acetate (CH₃COOEt).

3. **Reaction 3**: Ethyl acetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where the ethoxy group (-OEt) is replaced by a cyano group (-CN), forming acetylnitrile (CH₃C(O)CN).

4. **Reaction 4**: Acetylnitrile is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha carbon (CH₃ group) of acetylnitrile, forming a carbanion. This carbanion undergoes two nucleophilic substitutions with 1,5-dibromopentane, resulting in a gem-dialkylation. The final product is a molecule where the alpha carbon is attached to two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitrile group (CN). The structure of the final product is **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)₂C(O)CN**.

### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product
The final product has two identical pentyl groups attached to the central carbon. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the hydrogens in equivalent positions across the two pentyl groups will have the same chemical shift. The pentyl groups contribute the following distinct hydrogen environments:

1. **First CH₂ group (attached to the central carbon)**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups across the two pentyl chains → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
2. **Second CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
3. **Third CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
4. **Fourth CH₂ group**: Two hydrogens per CH₂, with two equivalent CH₂ groups → 4 hydrogens, one signal.
5. **Terminal CH₃ group**: Three hydrogens per CH₃, with two equivalent CH₃ groups → 6 hydrogens, one signal.

Thus, the pentyl groups contribute **5 distinct hydrogen signals**. The central carbon and the nitrile and carbonyl groups do not contribute additional hydrogens.

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product is **5**.

Answer: B
