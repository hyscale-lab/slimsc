Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, all right, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). Wait, so this is in polar coordinates, right? So r is the radial distance, and θ is the angular coordinate.

I remember that when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's often useful to separate the radial and angular parts. Oh yeah, because the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separation of variables. So maybe I can separate this potential into radial and angular components.

Looking at the potential: The first term is (1/2)k r². That looks familiar, like the potential for a harmonic oscillator in one dimension. Because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², but here it's in terms of r squared, so perhaps it's a radial harmonic oscillator.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about that. Cos squared theta can be written using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ] = (3/4) k r² (1 + cos(2θ)).

So the entire potential V(r, θ) becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Wait, let me compute those constants. (1/2 + 3/4) is (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But maybe I can think about this as a sum of two potentials: one being a purely radial term, and the other being angular-dependent.

Wait, but wait. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in two dimensions, sometimes it's easier to switch to Cartesian coordinates to see the form of the potential.

Let me recall that in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cos(2θ) can be expressed as cos²θ - sin²θ, which is (x² - y²)/r². So perhaps substituting that in.

So let me see: The second term in the potential is (3/4)k r² cos(2θ) = (3/4)k (x² - y²). Because x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ, so x² - y² = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ).

So putting it all together, the potential V(r, θ) in Cartesian coordinates is:

V = (5/4)k (x² + y²) + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Wait, let me compute that. (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k (x² - y²) = (5/4 + 3/4)k x² + (5/4 -3/4)k y². Because the x² terms are both positive, and the y² terms have 5/4 and -3/4.

So 5/4 +3/4 is 8/4=2, so 2k x². For the y² terms: 5/4-3/4=2/4=1/2, so (1/2) k y².

So the potential simplifies to V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². That looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, but with different coefficients for x² and y².

Oh, right! In the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential is usually symmetric, like V(x, y) = (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²). But here, it's not symmetric; the x and y terms have different coefficients.

Wait, so how does that affect the energy levels? I remember that in the isotropic (symmetric) case, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω, where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers. But when the potential is not isotropic, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, so perhaps each direction has its own frequency. Let me think about that.

In the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². Let me relate this to the standard harmonic oscillator potential. The standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So 2k x² = (1/2)m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m). So ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2)k y². So (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the frequencies in x and y directions are different. Now, in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ (ω_x + ω_y)/2? Wait, no, wait. I think I need to think more carefully.

Wait, in each direction, the energy is quantized as E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, and E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = [ (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x ] + [ (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y ].

Substituting the values of ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) * 1 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me compute the terms inside:

(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ) = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that seems to match.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps because I might have made a mistake.

So V(r,θ) was rewritten as 2k x² + 0.5k y². That part seems correct because when I expanded cos(2θ) in terms of x and y, and the coefficients added up to that.

Then, each direction's frequency comes from the potential. For x: 2k x^2 = (1/2)m ω_x^2 x^2 → ω_x^2 = (4k)/m, so ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

For y: 0.5k y^2 = (1/2)m ω_y^2 y^2 → ω_y^2 = (k/m), so ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Then, the energy in each direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Adding them gives:

E = (n_x + 1/2)(2) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding that: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 → 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So yes, that's correct. So the energy is (2n_x +n_y +3/2) multiplied by ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up n_x and n_y. The x direction has higher frequency, so higher energy per quantum number. So if n_x increases, the energy goes up more per unit than n_y. So the formula has 2n_x + n_y, which makes sense because the x direction contributes more.

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the correct one.

So the answer should be option C.

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To simplify, we rewrite \( \cos^2(\theta) \) using the double-angle identity: \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \). Substituting this into the potential, we get:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
\]

Combining the constants, the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
\]

Next, we express the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \), we find \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \). Substituting this, the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{5}{4}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{4}k(x^2 - y^2).
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The energy in each direction is quantized as \( E_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_x \) and \( E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_y \), where the frequencies are determined from the potential:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_x + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:

So the entire potential V(r, θ) becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Wait, let me compute those constants. (1/2 + 3/4) is (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But maybe I can think about this as a sum of two potentials: one being a purely radial term, and the other being angular-dependent.

So let me see: The second term in the potential is (3/4)k r² cos(2θ) = (3/4)k (x² - y²). Because x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ, so x² - y² = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ).

So putting it all together, the potential V(r, θ) in Cartesian coordinates is:

V = (5/4)k (x² + y²) + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Wait, let me compute that. (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k (x² - y²) = (5/4 + 3/4)k x² + (5/4 -3/4)k y². Because the x² terms are both positive, and the y² terms have 5/4 and -3/4.

So 5/4 +3/4 is 8/4=2, so 2k x². For the y² terms: 5/4-3/4=2/4=1/2, so (1/2) k y².

So the potential simplifies to V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². That looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, but with different coefficients for x² and y².

Oh, right! In the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential is usually symmetric, like V(x, y) = (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²). But here, it's not symmetric; the x and y terms have different coefficients.

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2)k y². So (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the frequencies in x and y directions are different. Now, in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ (ω_x + ω_y)/2? Wait, no, wait. I think I need to think more carefully.

Substituting the values of ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) * 1 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me compute the terms inside:

(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ) = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that seems to match.

Then, the energy in each direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Adding them gives:

E = (n_x + 1/2)(2) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding that: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 → 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So yes, that's correct. So the energy is (2n_x +n_y +3/2) multiplied by ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up n_x and n_y. The x direction has higher frequency, so higher energy per quantum number. So if n_x increases, the energy goes up more per unit than n_y. So the formula has 2n_x + n_y, which makes sense because the x direction contributes more.

So the answer should be option C.

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
\]

Combining the constants, the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
\]

Next, we express the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \), we find \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \). Substituting this, the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{5}{4}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{4}k(x^2 - y^2).
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The energy in each direction is quantized as \( E_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_x \) and \( E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_y \), where the frequencies are determined from the potential:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_x + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:
