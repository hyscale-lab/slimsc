Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field's magnitude is given as 1/r² and it only has a radial component. Hmm.

Alright, so I remember from my vector calculus class that there's something called the divergence theorem. Oh wait, right, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the vector field itself over the boundary of the volume. The formula is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

In this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface integral would be over a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) is radial and its magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) must be in the radial direction, which we can denote as r̂. So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Wait, but wait a second, what's the divergence of f in this case? Let me think. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a field that's purely radial is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component. So f_r is 1/r² here. Plugging that in, the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²)(0) = 0. Oh, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0?

But wait, if I use the divergence theorem, then the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So even if the divergence is zero everywhere inside, the flux could still be something if there's a source or a sink at the origin. Because, for example, the electric field of a point charge has divergence proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function at the origin. Oh right! So maybe f(r) is similar to an electric field.

Wait, the electric field of a point charge Q is E(r) = (1/(4πε₀)) (Q/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over any volume enclosing the origin would be Q/(ε₀) times 1/(4π), I think. Wait, no, the divergence of E is (1/ε₀) ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function. So the integral of ∇·E over all space is Q/ε₀.

But in this problem, the vector field f(r) is given as 1/r² radial, so similar to E but without the constants. So what would the divergence be? Let me compute it again. The radial component is f_r = 1/r². So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is zero except at r=0. But wait, no, more accurately, the divergence is a delta function at the origin because the field is like a monopole.

So the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere would be the same as the flux through the surface of the sphere. Because by the divergence theorem, the volume integral equals the flux through the surface.

Let me compute the flux. The flux is the integral of f · n over the surface of the sphere. Since n is the outward unit normal, which is in the radial direction, and f is also radial, the dot product is just f(r) times n · r̂ = f(r) * 1. So flux Φ = ∫∫ f(r) dA. f(r) is 1/r², but wait, at the surface of the sphere, r=R. So f(R) = 1/R².

So Φ = f(R) * 4π R². Because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². Plugging in f(R)=1/R², Φ = (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π. Looking at the options, option A is 4π.

Alternatively, could I have messed up the divergence somewhere? Let me think. If the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral is a delta function, then the total integral would be the same as if the divergence were a delta function scaled appropriately. So ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. Because for E, it's ∫ (∇·E) dV = Q/ε₀. Here, if f is like E with Q=1, then ∫ (∇·f) dV would be (1/ε₀) * (charge). Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps in this problem, the constants are taken as 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the divergence in general. Let me compute ∇·f in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (A_φ) ). Since our field has only a radial component, the other terms are zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is zero except possibly at r=0, but wait, the origin is a point where r=0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but when you integrate over a volume that includes the origin, you get a non-zero result because the divergence is a delta function at the origin.

So the integral ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π, which matches the flux calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 4 π.

To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R**, we use the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_{S} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]

where **V** is the volume of the sphere, **S** is its surface, and **n** is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

The vector field is given as **f(r)**, which has a magnitude of \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \) and is purely radial in spherical coordinates. Thus, **f(r)** can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of **f(r)**
In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \( A_r \) is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 A_r \right).
\]

For **f(r)**, \( A_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where it behaves like a delta function due to the point-like nature of the field.

### Step 2: Apply the divergence theorem
The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface of the sphere. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the integral over the volume is equivalent to the flux through the surface:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA.
\]

On the surface of the sphere (\( r = R \)), the outward normal vector **n** is radial, and **f(r)** is also radial. Therefore, the dot product simplifies to:

\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = f(R) = \frac{1}{R^2}.
\]

The flux through the surface is then:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = f(R) \cdot \text{Surface area of the sphere} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** over the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface, which is \( 4\pi \). This matches the behavior of a vector field similar to the electric field of a point charge, where the divergence is zero except at the origin, and the integral reflects the total flux emanating from the origin.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field's magnitude is given as 1/r² and it only has a radial component. Hmm.

Alright, so I remember from my vector calculus class that there's something called the divergence theorem. Oh wait, right, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the vector field itself over the boundary of the volume. The formula is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

In this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface integral would be over a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) is radial and its magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) must be in the radial direction, which we can denote as r̂. So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Wait, but wait a second, what's the divergence of f in this case? Let me think. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a field that's purely radial is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component. So f_r is 1/r² here. Plugging that in, the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²)(0) = 0. Oh, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0?

But wait, if I use the divergence theorem, then the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So even if the divergence is zero everywhere inside, the flux could still be something if there's a source or a sink at the origin. Because, for example, the electric field of a point charge has divergence proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function at the origin. Oh right! So maybe f(r) is similar to an electric field.

Wait, the electric field of a point charge Q is E(r) = (1/(4πε₀)) (Q/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over any volume enclosing the origin would be Q/(ε₀) times 1/(4π), I think. Wait, no, the divergence of E is (1/ε₀) ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function. So the integral of ∇·E over all space is Q/ε₀.

But in this problem, the vector field f(r) is given as 1/r² radial, so similar to E but without the constants. So what would the divergence be? Let me compute it again. The radial component is f_r = 1/r². So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is zero except at r=0. But wait, no, more accurately, the divergence is a delta function at the origin because the field is like a monopole.

So the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere would be the same as the flux through the surface of the sphere. Because by the divergence theorem, the volume integral equals the flux through the surface.

Let me compute the flux. The flux is the integral of f · n over the surface of the sphere. Since n is the outward unit normal, which is in the radial direction, and f is also radial, the dot product is just f(r) times n · r̂ = f(r) * 1. So flux Φ = ∫∫ f(r) dA. f(r) is 1/r², but wait, at the surface of the sphere, r=R. So f(R) = 1/R².

So Φ = f(R) * 4π R². Because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². Plugging in f(R)=1/R², Φ = (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π. Looking at the options, option A is 4π.

Alternatively, could I have messed up the divergence somewhere? Let me think. If the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral is a delta function, then the total integral would be the same as if the divergence were a delta function scaled appropriately. So ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. Because for E, it's ∫ (∇·E) dV = Q/ε₀. Here, if f is like E with Q=1, then ∫ (∇·f) dV would be (1/ε₀) * (charge). Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps in this problem, the constants are taken as 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the divergence in general. Let me compute ∇·f in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (A_φ) ). Since our field has only a radial component, the other terms are zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is zero except possibly at r=0, but wait, the origin is a point where r=0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but when you integrate over a volume that includes the origin, you get a non-zero result because the divergence is a delta function at the origin.

So the integral ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π, which matches the flux calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 4 π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R**, we use the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_{S} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]

where **V** is the volume of the sphere, **S** is its surface, and **n** is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

The vector field is given as **f(r)**, which has a magnitude of \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \) and is purely radial in spherical coordinates. Thus, **f(r)** can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of **f(r)**
In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \( A_r \) is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 A_r \right).
\]

For **f(r)**, \( A_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where it behaves like a delta function due to the point-like nature of the field.

### Step 2: Apply the divergence theorem
The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface of the sphere. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the integral over the volume is equivalent to the flux through the surface:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA.
\]

On the surface of the sphere (\( r = R \)), the outward normal vector **n** is radial, and **f(r)** is also radial. Therefore, the dot product simplifies to:

\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = f(R) = \frac{1}{R^2}.
\]

The flux through the surface is then:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = f(R) \cdot \text{Surface area of the sphere} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** over the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface, which is \( 4\pi \). This matches the behavior of a vector field similar to the electric field of a point charge, where the divergence is zero except at the origin, and the integral reflects the total flux emanating from the origin.

Thus, the correct answer is:
