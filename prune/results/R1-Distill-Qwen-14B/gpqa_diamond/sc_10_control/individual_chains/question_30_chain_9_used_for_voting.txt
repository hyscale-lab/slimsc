Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this.

The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which I remember means that there are a lot of alternating double bonds, right? Conjugated systems usually lead to certain types of electronic transitions, like maybe the ones that absorb visible light. Oh wait, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. But wait, what's the connection between emitted light and the absorbed light?

Oh right! The dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. Wait, no, no, maybe it's the other way around. When a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. The energy of the absorbed photon is what excites the electrons. Then, when the electrons drop back down, they emit light. But wait, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed one, right? Because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

So the question is, what color is absorbed? Let's think about the energy. The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. But that's when the electrons drop from a higher energy state to a lower one. The energy absorbed would be higher, I think. Because absorption is when they jump up, which requires more energy.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

Visible light is in the range of about 400-700 nm. Let's see what 2.3393 eV corresponds to in wavelength. I can use the conversion: 1 eV is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So 2.3393 eV would be 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that. 1240 divided by 2 is 620, so 2.3393 would be lower than that. Let me compute: 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. Hmm, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the emitted light is 530 nm. So what color is that? Green light is around 530 nm. But the question is about the color absorbed.

Wait, the absorbed light would be higher energy than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, then emits as it relaxes. But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon would correspond to the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state. The emitted photon would correspond to the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state, perhaps. Or maybe it's the same energy gap, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the states involved in the emission. So if a molecule emits a photon of energy E, that E is the difference between the higher and lower energy levels. But the absorbed photon's energy is the same E if it's the same transition. Wait, no, that's only if it's a two-level system. But in reality, molecules have more complex energy levels. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to an excited state (higher energy). Then, it can emit a photon as it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon would have to be higher than the energy of the emitted one. Because the molecule goes from ground state to a higher state (absorption), and then when it emits, it drops to a lower state than the excited state, perhaps. Or maybe it's the same transition, but in that case, the emitted photon's energy would be the same as the absorbed one, which doesn't make sense because then you wouldn't have a net energy change.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the question is asking. The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That emission corresponds to the energy difference between two states in the molecule. The absorption would typically be at a higher energy because it's promoting electrons from a lower to a higher energy state. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one.

Wait, but some sources say that the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy gap. But the emitted photon's energy is from a lower state to a higher state? No, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's going from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher one (excited state). Then, when it emits, it goes from that higher state to a lower one (maybe the ground state again, or another lower state). So the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground. The emitted photon's energy would be E_emit = E_excited - E_emission_state. If it's emitting when going back to the ground state, then E_emit = E_abs. But in fluorescence, when the molecule emits a photon when relaxing, the energy is usually lower than the absorbed photon because some energy is lost as heat or other modes. Hmm, so maybe the energy of emission is less than absorption? Or is it the same?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the wavelengths. If the emitted light is 530 nm (green), then the absorbed light must be at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) since the energy of the absorbed photon is higher. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, so if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be higher energy, which is blue or violet, because blue is around 450-495 nm, violet is around 380-450. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed would be at a shorter wavelength, which is blue or violet.

Wait, but in reality, the absorption and emission are part of the same electronic transition. So perhaps when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's in the visible range, and when it emits, it could be a different color. For example, in fluorescence, sometimes the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed one. So, the absorbed photon is higher in energy.

But wait, the question says that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So what color is the absorbed? Let's compute the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this step by step.

1. Energy of emitted photon: E_emit = 2.3393 eV.

2. The energy of the absorbed photon E_abs must be higher than E_emit, because the molecule is absorbing energy to get excited, then emitting some as it relaxes. So E_abs > E_emit.

3. The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength: E = hc/lambda.

4. So, since E_abs > E_emit, lambda_abs < lambda_emit.

5. So, if the emitted light is, say, green (530 nm), the absorbed light would have a shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

So let's compute lambda_emit first.

E = 2.3393 eV. Using E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / lambda = (hc)/lambda.

But E is given in eV, so using the conversion: 1 eV = hc/(1240 eV·nm). So lambda (in nm) = 1240 / E(eV).

So lambda_emit = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that.

1240 / 2.3393 ≈ approximately 530 nm. Because 2.3393 * 530 ≈ 1240. So yes, around 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the absorbed light must be higher energy, so shorter wavelength. What colors are higher in energy than green? The visible spectrum goes from violet (400) to red (700). So green is in the middle. Higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green would be blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (below 450).

So which of the options are in that range? The options are A) Red (long wavelength, lower energy), B) Violet (short), C) Blue (shorter than green but longer than violet), D) Yellow (longer than green, lower energy).

So the absorbed light is higher energy than the emitted, which is green. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

Which option corresponds to a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than 530 nm? That would be either violet (B) or blue (C). So the options are B and C.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So what color is absorbed by the compound?

Wait, in the context of conjugated dyes, when they absorb light, the color they absorb is complementary to the color they emit. Because the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. Oh! Wait, that's about the color of the material, not necessarily the absorbed photons.

Wait, another approach: The color of the compound is the color it reflects or emits. But when it absorbs, it takes in the complementary color. For example, if something appears red, it absorbs all colors except red, so it absorbs blue and green.

Wait, but in this question, the compound emits green (530 nm). So the compound's color is not directly the emitted color, because it's emitting light. Wait, no, when something emits light, like a fluorescent substance, it emits a certain color when excited.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the energy. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, emits a lower energy photon.

So, if the emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed is a higher energy (shorter wavelength), which would be in the blue or violet range.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). How to choose between them.

Wait, the question says 'what color of light is absorbed'. The emitted is green, so the absorbed must be higher in energy, which would be blue or violet.

But wait, I think I remember that the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is such that the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed. So, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

The energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the energy gap between the ground and excited states. Because when the molecule absorbs that photon, it gets promoted. Then, when it emits, it can drop to a lower state, emitting a photon of lower energy. So the energy of the emitted photon would be less than the absorbed. So E_abs > E_emit.

So, in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed must be higher. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So, let's calculate the wavelength for the absorbed photon.

Wait, but we don't have the energy for the absorbed photon. So, perhaps another approach is to think about the relationship between the energy of the absorbed photon and the emission. But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps we can think about typical transitions.

Wait, in a conjugated system like this, the energy gap corresponds to a certain wavelength. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, meaning longer wavelengths (red shift). So, a large conjugated system would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. But wait, the molecule emits green. So the energy gap is about 2.3393 eV. But wait, the absorbed photon would be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength than the emitted.

Wait, but when a molecule absorbs, it's the energy of the photon that's absorbed that determines the transition. So, if the molecule emits in the green, the absorbed photon is probably blue or violet.

So, the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, so it's either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

So, which one is more likely? Well, green is around 530nm, so the absorbed must be blue or violet, which are higher energy.

But, in terms of the color absorbed, the compound would absorb the complementary color of the emitted color. Wait, no, that's not quite correct. Because the compound's color is determined by what it reflects, not necessarily what it absorbs. Wait, no, maybe that's for materials that don't fluoresce. In this case, the dye emits green when excited, but the color we see is probably a combination of what it absorbs and emits.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think again. The question is, what color is absorbed by the compound? The compound emits green, so it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet). So which option is correct?

The options are:
A) Red (long wavelength, 700 nm)
B) Violet (~400-450)
C) Blue (~450-495)
D) Yellow (around 570-590)

So, the emitted is 530 nm, so the absorbed is shorter than that. So the possible options are B and C.

But how to choose between B and C?

I remember that the energy of the photon absorbed is equal to the energy gap. The emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and a lower state, maybe not the ground state. Sometimes, molecules have multiple excited states. But without knowing specifics, perhaps we can think about the typical emission and absorption for conjugated dyes.

Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, so longer wavelengths absorbed. Wait, but the emission is at 530 nm. So, the absorption should be at a shorter wavelength than that, because the energy gap for absorption is higher than the emission. So, if E_abs is higher, the wavelength is shorter.

So, for example, if the molecule emits green, it might have absorbed blue or violet light. Which color would correspond to a higher energy than green.

Wait, the colors in order from low to high energy (long to short wavelength):

Red (700), Orange (610), Yellow (580), Green (530), Blue (470), Violet (400).

So, green is in the middle. Violet is higher energy, blue is next.

So, if the emitted is green (530), the absorbed would be blue or violet.

So, the question is: which option is among the choices? B is violet, C is blue.

But wait, the question is asking about the color absorbed, not the color emitted. So, the compound emits green because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), as that's what excites it.

So, the absorbed light must be in the blue or violet range. So, the options are B and C.

But which one is correct? Well, in some cases, when a molecule has a conjugated system, the absorption is in the visible range. For example, many organic dyes absorb in the blue or near UV, which corresponds to higher energy transitions.

So, for example, if the compound emits green (530 nm), the absorbed wavelength would be in the blue or violet range. Let me think about an example. For instance, fluorescein is a dye that emits green light when excited with blue light. So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green. So in that case, absorption is blue.

So in this question, the emitted is green, so the absorbed would be blue. So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but wait, another example: another dye might absorb in the violet and emit green. So it depends on the specific molecule.

Hmm. Without more specifics, perhaps I should rely on the fact that the conjugated system allows for a longer wavelength absorption than the emission. Wait, no, because the absorption is at higher energy, which is shorter wavelength.

Wait, no, when the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength), that's why it emits a lower energy photon. So the absorption is blue or violet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the energy of the absorbed photon. Wait, I don't have the energy of the absorbed photon, so I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute that wavelength.

E (eV) = 2.3393.

lambda (nm) = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. So, green.

The absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, so its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So, what color is that? Well, if it's around 450 nm, that's blue. 400 nm is violet.

So, the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the range of blue or violet. So, the options are B or C.

But, without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to choose, but perhaps the question expects you to know that the energy difference is such that the absorption is blue. Or maybe it's more likely that the absorbed photon is blue, as in the example I thought of earlier (fluorescein).

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy of the emission plus the energy loss. But without knowing more, I think the best approach is to choose based on typical examples. So, if the emission is green, the absorption is typically blue. Hence, option C.

The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. The dye contains extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which suggests that the energy transitions are related to visible light absorption and emission.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy of Emitted Light**:  
   The energy of the emitted light is given as \( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Using the relationship \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) and the conversion \( 1 \, \text{eV} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda} \), the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to green light.

2. **Energy of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted light because the molecule absorbs a photon to become excited and then emits a photon of lower energy as it relaxes. Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (\( E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda} \)), the absorbed light will have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted light.

3. **Color of Absorbed Light**:  
   The emitted light is green (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \approx 530 \, \text{nm} \)), so the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength, corresponding to blue or violet.  
   - Blue light is typically in the range \( 450 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 495 \, \text{nm} \).  
   - Violet light is typically in the range \( 380 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 450 \, \text{nm} \).  

4. **Eliminating Other Options**:  
   - **Red (Option A)**: Red light has a longer wavelength (\( \sim 700 \, \text{nm} \)) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.  
   - **Yellow (Option D)**: Yellow light has a longer wavelength (\( \sim 570 \, \text{nm} \)) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.  

5. **Choosing Between Blue and Violet**:  
   While both blue and violet are shorter wavelengths than green, the question asks for the color of light absorbed. Many organic dyes, such as fluorescein, absorb in the blue region and emit in the green region. This makes blue a more likely candidate for the absorbed light in this case.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed light is blue, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than green but longer than violet. Based on typical examples and the reasoning above, the most likely answer is **C) Blue**.

Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this.

The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which I remember means that there are a lot of alternating double bonds, right? Conjugated systems usually lead to certain types of electronic transitions, like maybe the ones that absorb visible light. Oh wait, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV.

Hmm, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the emitted light is 530 nm. So what color is that? Green light is around 530 nm. But the question is about the color absorbed.

Wait, the absorbed light would be higher energy than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, then emits as it relaxes. But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon would correspond to the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state. The emitted photon would correspond to the energy difference between the excited state and a lower state, perhaps. Or maybe it's the same energy gap, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the states involved in the emission. So if a molecule emits a photon of energy E, that E is the difference between the higher and lower energy levels. But the absorbed photon's energy is the same E if it's the same transition. Wait, no, that's only if it's a two-level system. But in reality, molecules have more complex energy levels. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to an excited state (higher energy). Then, it can emit a photon as it relaxes.

Or maybe it's the same transition, but in that case, the emitted photon's energy would be the same as the absorbed one, which doesn't make sense because then you wouldn't have a net energy change.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the question is asking. The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That emission corresponds to the energy difference between two states in the molecule. The absorption would typically be at a higher energy because it's promoting electrons from a lower to a higher energy state. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one.

Wait, but some sources say that the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy gap. But the emitted photon's energy is from a lower state to a higher state? No, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's going from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher one (excited state). Then, when it emits, it goes from that higher state to a lower one (maybe the ground state again, or another lower state). So the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground. The emitted photon's energy would be E_emit = E_excited - E_emission_state. If it's emitting when going back to the ground state, then E_emit = E_abs. But in fluorescence, when the molecule emits a photon when relaxing, the energy is usually lower than the absorbed photon because some energy is lost as heat or other modes. Hmm, so maybe the energy of emission is less than absorption? Or is it the same?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the wavelengths. If the emitted light is 530 nm (green), then the absorbed light must be at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) since the energy of the absorbed photon is higher. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, so if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be higher energy, which is blue or violet, because blue is around 450-495 nm, violet is around 380-450. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed would be at a shorter wavelength, which is blue or violet.

Wait, but in reality, the absorption and emission are part of the same electronic transition. So perhaps when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's in the visible range, and when it emits, it could be a different color. For example, in fluorescence, sometimes the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed one. So, the absorbed photon is higher in energy.

But wait, the question says that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So what color is the absorbed? Let's compute the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this step by step.

1. Energy of emitted photon: E_emit = 2.3393 eV.

2. The energy of the absorbed photon E_abs must be higher than E_emit, because the molecule is absorbing energy to get excited, then emitting some as it relaxes. So E_abs > E_emit.

3. The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength: E = hc/lambda.

4. So, since E_abs > E_emit, lambda_abs < lambda_emit.

5. So, if the emitted light is, say, green (530 nm), the absorbed light would have a shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

So let's compute lambda_emit first.

E = 2.3393 eV. Using E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / lambda = (hc)/lambda.

But E is given in eV, so using the conversion: 1 eV = hc/(1240 eV·nm). So lambda (in nm) = 1240 / E(eV).

So lambda_emit = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that.

1240 / 2.3393 ≈ approximately 530 nm. Because 2.3393 * 530 ≈ 1240. So yes, around 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the absorbed light must be higher energy, so shorter wavelength. What colors are higher in energy than green? The visible spectrum goes from violet (400) to red (700). So green is in the middle. Higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green would be blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (below 450).

So which of the options are in that range? The options are A) Red (long wavelength, lower energy), B) Violet (short), C) Blue (shorter than green but longer than violet), D) Yellow (longer than green, lower energy).

So the absorbed light is higher energy than the emitted, which is green. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

Which option corresponds to a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than 530 nm? That would be either violet (B) or blue (C). So the options are B and C.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So what color is absorbed by the compound?

Wait, in the context of conjugated dyes, when they absorb light, the color they absorb is complementary to the color they emit. Because the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. Oh! Wait, that's about the color of the material, not necessarily the absorbed photons.

Wait, another approach: The color of the compound is the color it reflects or emits. But when it absorbs, it takes in the complementary color. For example, if something appears red, it absorbs all colors except red, so it absorbs blue and green.

Wait, but in this question, the compound emits green (530 nm). So the compound's color is not directly the emitted color, because it's emitting light. Wait, no, when something emits light, like a fluorescent substance, it emits a certain color when excited.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the energy. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, emits a lower energy photon.

So, if the emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed is a higher energy (shorter wavelength), which would be in the blue or violet range.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue). How to choose between them.

Wait, the question says 'what color of light is absorbed'. The emitted is green, so the absorbed must be higher in energy, which would be blue or violet.

But wait, I think I remember that the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is such that the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed. So, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

The energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the energy gap between the ground and excited states. Because when the molecule absorbs that photon, it gets promoted. Then, when it emits, it can drop to a lower state, emitting a photon of lower energy. So the energy of the emitted photon would be less than the absorbed. So E_abs > E_emit.

So, in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed must be higher. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So, let's calculate the wavelength for the absorbed photon.

Wait, but we don't have the energy for the absorbed photon. So, perhaps another approach is to think about the relationship between the energy of the absorbed photon and the emission. But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps we can think about typical transitions.

Wait, in a conjugated system like this, the energy gap corresponds to a certain wavelength. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, meaning longer wavelengths (red shift). So, a large conjugated system would absorb in the longer wavelength (lower energy) region. But wait, the molecule emits green. So the energy gap is about 2.3393 eV. But wait, the absorbed photon would be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength than the emitted.

Wait, but when a molecule absorbs, it's the energy of the photon that's absorbed that determines the transition. So, if the molecule emits in the green, the absorbed photon is probably blue or violet.

So, the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, so it's either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

So, which one is more likely? Well, green is around 530nm, so the absorbed must be blue or violet, which are higher energy.

But, in terms of the color absorbed, the compound would absorb the complementary color of the emitted color. Wait, no, that's not quite correct. Because the compound's color is determined by what it reflects, not necessarily what it absorbs. Wait, no, maybe that's for materials that don't fluoresce. In this case, the dye emits green when excited, but the color we see is probably a combination of what it absorbs and emits.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think again. The question is, what color is absorbed by the compound? The compound emits green, so it must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet). So which option is correct?

The options are:
A) Red (long wavelength, 700 nm)
B) Violet (~400-450)
C) Blue (~450-495)
D) Yellow (around 570-590)

So, the emitted is 530 nm, so the absorbed is shorter than that. So the possible options are B and C.

But how to choose between B and C?

I remember that the energy of the photon absorbed is equal to the energy gap. The emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and a lower state, maybe not the ground state. Sometimes, molecules have multiple excited states. But without knowing specifics, perhaps we can think about the typical emission and absorption for conjugated dyes.

Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, so longer wavelengths absorbed. Wait, but the emission is at 530 nm. So, the absorption should be at a shorter wavelength than that, because the energy gap for absorption is higher than the emission. So, if E_abs is higher, the wavelength is shorter.

So, for example, if the molecule emits green, it might have absorbed blue or violet light. Which color would correspond to a higher energy than green.

Wait, the colors in order from low to high energy (long to short wavelength):

Red (700), Orange (610), Yellow (580), Green (530), Blue (470), Violet (400).

So, green is in the middle. Violet is higher energy, blue is next.

So, if the emitted is green (530), the absorbed would be blue or violet.

So, the question is: which option is among the choices? B is violet, C is blue.

But wait, the question is asking about the color absorbed, not the color emitted. So, the compound emits green because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), as that's what excites it.

So, the absorbed light must be in the blue or violet range. So, the options are B and C.

But which one is correct? Well, in some cases, when a molecule has a conjugated system, the absorption is in the visible range. For example, many organic dyes absorb in the blue or near UV, which corresponds to higher energy transitions.

So, for example, if the compound emits green (530 nm), the absorbed wavelength would be in the blue or violet range. Let me think about an example. For instance, fluorescein is a dye that emits green light when excited with blue light. So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green. So in that case, absorption is blue.

So in this question, the emitted is green, so the absorbed would be blue. So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but wait, another example: another dye might absorb in the violet and emit green. So it depends on the specific molecule.

Hmm. Without more specifics, perhaps I should rely on the fact that the conjugated system allows for a longer wavelength absorption than the emission. Wait, no, because the absorption is at higher energy, which is shorter wavelength.

Wait, no, when the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength), that's why it emits a lower energy photon. So the absorption is blue or violet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the energy of the absorbed photon. Wait, I don't have the energy of the absorbed photon, so I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute that wavelength.

E (eV) = 2.3393.

lambda (nm) = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. So, green.

The absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, so its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So, what color is that? Well, if it's around 450 nm, that's blue. 400 nm is violet.

So, the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the range of blue or violet. So, the options are B or C.

But, without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to choose, but perhaps the question expects you to know that the energy difference is such that the absorption is blue. Or maybe it's more likely that the absorbed photon is blue, as in the example I thought of earlier (fluorescein).

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy of the emission plus the energy loss. But without knowing more, I think the best approach is to choose based on typical examples. So, if the emission is green, the absorption is typically blue. Hence, option C.


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. The dye contains extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which suggests that the energy transitions are related to visible light absorption and emission.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy of Emitted Light**:  
   The energy of the emitted light is given as \( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Using the relationship \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) and the conversion \( 1 \, \text{eV} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda} \), the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to green light.

2. **Energy of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted light because the molecule absorbs a photon to become excited and then emits a photon of lower energy as it relaxes. Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (\( E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda} \)), the absorbed light will have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted light.

3. **Color of Absorbed Light**:  
   The emitted light is green (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \approx 530 \, \text{nm} \)), so the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength, corresponding to blue or violet.  
   - Blue light is typically in the range \( 450 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 495 \, \text{nm} \).  
   - Violet light is typically in the range \( 380 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 450 \, \text{nm} \).  

4. **Eliminating Other Options**:  
   - **Red (Option A)**: Red light has a longer wavelength (\( \sim 700 \, \text{nm} \)) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.  
   - **Yellow (Option D)**: Yellow light has a longer wavelength (\( \sim 570 \, \text{nm} \)) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.  

5. **Choosing Between Blue and Violet**:  
   While both blue and violet are shorter wavelengths than green, the question asks for the color of light absorbed. Many organic dyes, such as fluorescein, absorb in the blue region and emit in the green region. This makes blue a more likely candidate for the absorbed light in this case.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed light is blue, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than green but longer than violet. Based on typical examples and the reasoning above, the most likely answer is **C) Blue**.
