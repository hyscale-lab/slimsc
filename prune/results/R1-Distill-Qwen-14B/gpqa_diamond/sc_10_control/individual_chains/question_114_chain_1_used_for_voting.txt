Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents A and B from the options provided. 

First reaction:
Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and Reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and methyl groups on the same carbon.

Second reaction:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with Reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is getting converted into a carboxylic acid here.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. I know that when ketones react with HCN or its derivatives, they form cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation is a reaction where a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide source to form a compound with adjacent hydroxyl and cyano groups. 

So, butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is providing the cyanide ion. But to form the cyanohydrin, I think the ketone needs to be protonated first. So, perhaps Reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), or maybe something else. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. In the cyanohydrin formation, the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophilic cyanide on the carbonyl carbon after it's been protonated. So, the acid would help in protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which facilitates the attack by CN-.

So, Reagent A should be an acid. Looking at the options, both A and B have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- can act as an acid). So, either could be possible, but which one is correct here?

Wait, but sometimes in such reactions, the addition of HCN is done under acidic conditions. But NaCN is a source of CN-, and if the solution is acidic, then the CN- would be protonated to HCN, right? Wait, maybe that's a problem. Because if the solution is strongly acidic, would the CN- even be available for the reaction?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the solvent. I think the reaction between ketones and NaCN is typically done in a protic solvent, and sometimes with the addition of acid. Wait, no, wait. Another approach: if the reaction is done with aqueous NaCN and acid, perhaps H3O+ is the reagent. So, Reagent A is H3O+.

So for the first part, Reagent A is H3O+. That would point towards options A or B, since those are the only ones with H3O+ as A.

Now moving to the second reaction: the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. That's a typical hydrolysis of nitriles. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids or their salts.

In the presence of water (as given, Reagent B is H2O), what's the condition? Let's think. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. Because if it's basic, the product would be a carboxylate, which then needs acid work-up. But if the question says that Reagent B is H2O, perhaps the conditions are acidic or basic.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is written as B (H2O). So perhaps B is the acid or base. Because hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using H2O with acid (like HCl) as a catalyst, or with a base (like NaOH) followed by acidification.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is probably HCl. Because the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the hydrolysis was done under acidic conditions. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrolyzed in a two-step process. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, I think the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a -COOH group.

So, the reagents for the second reaction would be H2O and an acid catalyst, such as HCl. Because the nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions forms the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, the second part (Reagent B) is either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

So, putting it together:

First reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Second reaction, B is HCl (so options A or C).

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The second reaction's B is H2O, but the reagent is written as B (H2O). So does that mean H2O is the reagent, or is H2O part of the solution, and B is something else?

Wait, the question says the reagents for the reaction are B (H2O). So perhaps in the second reaction, the reagent is water and another component. Or maybe that the reaction is under aqueous conditions, perhaps with an acid.

Wait, the second reaction is:

[2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile] + B (H2O) → [2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid]

So, the reagent is B, and H2O is in parentheses, meaning that H2O is the solvent or part of the reagent.

Wait, perhaps for the second reaction, H2O is present, and the catalyst is HCl. Because nitrile hydrolysis typically uses H2O with acid (like HCl) or base (like NaOH). So if the product is the acid, then it's acidic conditions.

So, the second reaction's reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, the correct option would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. That's option A.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: is the second reaction a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a ketone, or to a carboxylic acid? Because sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under different conditions to give different products.

Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles can go through different mechanisms. For example, in acidic conditions, H2O and H+ would protonate the nitrile, leading to the formation of an imidamide intermediate, then tautomerism to form an amide, and further hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, in basic conditions, you get a carboxylate, which can be acidified to the carboxylic acid.

So, in any case, the presence of H2O and acid (like HCl) would lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid.

So, that would suggest that for the second reaction, B is HCl. So the correct option is option A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but option A is option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Reagents:** Butan-2-one, NaCN, and Reagent A  
**Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  

This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation requires the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. The presence of an acid is necessary for this protonation. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step. This aligns with options A and B.

### Reaction 2:
**Reagents:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, Reagent B (H₂O)  
**Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is the most suitable reagent for this step. This aligns with options A and C.

### Final Selection:
From the analysis, Reagent A is **H₃O⁺** (for the first reaction), and Reagent B is **HCl** (for the second reaction). This combination matches **Option A**.
