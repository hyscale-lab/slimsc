Okay, let's see. I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities and energies at significant fractions of the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. So I need to apply the relativistic formulas here.

The question states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed between them? Oh, right, because in relativity, adding velocities isn't as simple as in classical mechanics. Oh yeah, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, is that the formula for when they're moving in the same direction?

Wait, no, the correct formula for relative speed when two objects are moving in opposite directions would use that formula, but here they are both moving in the same direction. So if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds divided by some factor. Let me think again.

Oh wait, no, the formula for the relative velocity depends on the frame of reference. So if the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative speed that one would observe the other moving at is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) ), but actually, wait, perhaps it's better to think of it in terms of the velocities as measured from one frame to another.

Wait, perhaps I should pick one astronaut as the observer and compute the relative speed of the other. Let's say astronaut A is at rest, and we calculate the speed of astronaut B according to A's frame. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (vB - vA) in the non-relativistic case, but relativistically it's different. So the formula I should use is (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/(c²)) ) ?

Wait, let's get that right. The formula for the relative speed v when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction (as observed from the lab frame) would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) ), right? Because if u is the velocity of one object and v is the velocity of the other in the same direction, from the perspective of the first object, the second is approaching at (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? So u is A's speed relative to the lab (0.6c), and v is B's speed relative to the lab (0.5c). Wait, no, wait. If the lab frame is where both are moving, then from A's frame, the speed of B would be (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)), but since vB is less than vA (since 0.5 <0.6), this would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense because B is behind A but moving slower. Hmm, maybe I should think about this more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should consider each astronaut's velocity relative to the other. So the relative velocity of B as seen from A is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)). So substituting, vB is 0.5c, vA is 0.6c. So the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. Negative because B is moving slower, so from A's frame, B is approaching at 0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. Now, I need to find which one is correct. Let me check the calculation again. So for the relative velocity, the formula is (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/c²). So vA is 0.6c, vB is 0.5c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 0.7. So yes, -0.1c /0.7 is -0.1428c, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that eliminates options A and B, which have 0.1c and 1.1c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. So E_total = gamma_A * m_A c² + gamma_B * m_B c².

Each gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A: v = 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Mass is 2m: so energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v=0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Mass is 3m: so energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct E is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative velocity and total energy of the system.

### Relative Velocity
The relative velocity formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that astronaut B is moving slower than astronaut A in the same direction. The magnitude of the relative velocity is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative velocity is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

Negative because B is moving slower, so from A's frame, B is approaching at 0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. Now, I need to find which one is correct. Let me check the calculation again. So for the relative velocity, the formula is (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/c²). So vA is 0.6c, vB is 0.5c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 0.7. So yes, -0.1c /0.7 is -0.1428c, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that eliminates options A and B, which have 0.1c and 1.1c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. So E_total = gamma_A * m_A c² + gamma_B * m_B c².

Each gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A: v = 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Mass is 2m: so energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v=0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Mass is 3m: so energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct E is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative velocity and total energy of the system.

### Relative Velocity
The relative velocity formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that astronaut B is moving slower than astronaut A in the same direction. The magnitude of the relative velocity is approximately \(0.14c\).

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}

For astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative velocity is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
