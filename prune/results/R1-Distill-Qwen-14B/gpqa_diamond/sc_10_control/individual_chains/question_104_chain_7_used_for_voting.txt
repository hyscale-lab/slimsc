Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, so the setup: there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. RV detects them by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, but more precisely, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us. K depends on several factors.

I recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K: 

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (2π)^(1/3)) )

But wait, since both planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are roughly the same. And the stars are similar to the Sun, so their masses are the same too. Also, both orbits are circular, so e = 0, which means 1 - e² is 1. So the denominator in the cube root part becomes (M_* + M_p)^2. But since M_* is much larger than M_p (Sun is much more massive than Neptune), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator is roughly M_* squared. So that simplifies things a bit.

Wait, but in reality, the formula for K is usually given as:

K = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so sin i is approximately 1 because the orbits are likely edge-on (otherwise, we wouldn't detect them via RV, right?), and e is zero for circular orbits. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) / (c) ) * ( (M_p) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K involves P^(-1/3). So if K is larger, that would imply a shorter period, assuming other factors are constant.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) c ) )

But simplifying, with M_p << M_*, and e=0, sin i ≈ 1, so K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) c )

Wait, but in this case, the two planets have similar masses (Neptune), and their stars have the same mass. So M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. So the only variable here is the orbital period P.

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Because all other terms (like M_p, M_*, etc.) are the same for both planets.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-derive this more carefully. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) / c

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was a bit confused. Let me get this right.

The actual formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] * (2π / P)^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. The correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of the velocity amplitude being related to the orbital period and the mass ratio. 

Wait, another approach. The star's velocity is given by K = (v) = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius (which is much smaller than the planet's orbit, a_p, due to the star's much larger mass). But a_* is related to the planet's orbit via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in terms of the star's orbit: (a_*)^3 / (P^2) = G (M_p) / (4π² (M_* + M_p)^2 )

Wait, no, the actual Kepler's third law is: (a_p)^3 / (P^2) = G (M_* + M_p) / (4 π² )

But since M_p << M_*, this becomes a_p³ ≈ [ G M_* P² ] / (4 π² )

But a_* is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit, which is a_p * (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) ) ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_*) ), again because M_* >> M_p.

So a_* ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_* )

Then, the star's velocity K is 2π a_* / P.

Substituting a_* gives K ≈ (2π a_p (M_p / M_* )) ) / P.

But from Kepler's law, a_p^3 = G M_* P² / (4 π² )

So a_p = [ G M_* P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting this into K:

K ≈ (2π / P) * [ ( G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p / M_* )

Let me compute this:

First, [ G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) = ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) )

So, K ≈ (2π / P ) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p / M_* )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let's factor out terms:

= (2 π ) / P * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * P^(2/3) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Combine the terms:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 -1) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Wait, 2π / P multiplied by P^(2/3) is P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3).

So:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Now, let's simplify the constants:

2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Factor 4 as 2², so:

(4 π² )^(1/3) = (2² π² )^(1/3 ) ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3 )

So,

2 π / [ 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ] = [ 2 / 2^(2/3) ) ] * [ π / π^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

2 is 2^(1), so 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3 )

π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3) ) = π^(1/3 )

So overall, 2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So, putting it all together:

K = (2 π )^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3 ) * (M_p / M_* ) * P^(-1/3 )

Factor out the terms:

K = [ (2 π G M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * ( M_p / M_* ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, but M_* is the same for both stars. M_p is same for both planets. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ).

Hmm, so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

Therefore, K1 = 5 miliangstrom, K2 = 7 miliangstrom.

So K2 / K1 = 7 /5 = 1.4

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), then P is proportional to (K)⁻³.

Wait, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3 ), so P is proportional to (1/K )^3 = K^(-3 )

Therefore, the ratio of periods P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )³

Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), then P is proportional to K^(-3 )

So,

P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Given K1=5, K2=7,

K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143

Cube that: (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

Wait, so P2 is shorter than P1, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1?

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's shorter, so it's approximately 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 = 0.36, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. No, wait, that's not correct. Because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So the correct ratio is 0.36.

Wait, but wait. The options are A) 0.36, B) 1.4, C) 1.96, D) 0.85.

So according to this, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the answer would be A) ~0.36.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's double-check.

Given that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P = constant * (1/K )^3.

So, for planet #2, K2 =7, P2 = C*(1/7)^3.

For planet #1: K1=5, P1= C*(1/5)^3.

So the ratio P2 / P1 = [ (1/7)^3 / (1/5)^3 ] = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times as long as planet 1's period. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is, how many times is P2 longer than P1? So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( P \propto K^{-3} \). 

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #2),

the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, so the setup: there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. RV detects them by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, but more precisely, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us. K depends on several factors.

I recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K: 

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (2π)^(1/3)) )

But wait, since both planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are roughly the same. And the stars are similar to the Sun, so their masses are the same too. Also, both orbits are circular, so e = 0, which means 1 - e² is 1. So the denominator in the cube root part becomes (M_* + M_p)^2. But since M_* is much larger than M_p (Sun is much more massive than Neptune), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator is roughly M_* squared. So that simplifies things a bit.

Wait, but in reality, the formula for K is usually given as:

K = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so sin i is approximately 1 because the orbits are likely edge-on (otherwise, we wouldn't detect them via RV, right?), and e is zero for circular orbits. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) / (c) ) * ( (M_p) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K involves P^(-1/3). So if K is larger, that would imply a shorter period, assuming other factors are constant.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) c ) )

But simplifying, with M_p << M_*, and e=0, sin i ≈ 1, so K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) c )

Wait, but in this case, the two planets have similar masses (Neptune), and their stars have the same mass. So M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. So the only variable here is the orbital period P.

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Because all other terms (like M_p, M_*, etc.) are the same for both planets.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-derive this more carefully. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) / c

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was a bit confused. Let me get this right.

The actual formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] * (2π / P)^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. The correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of the velocity amplitude being related to the orbital period and the mass ratio. 

Wait, another approach. The star's velocity is given by K = (v) = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius (which is much smaller than the planet's orbit, a_p, due to the star's much larger mass). But a_* is related to the planet's orbit via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in terms of the star's orbit: (a_*)^3 / (P^2) = G (M_p) / (4π² (M_* + M_p)^2 )

Wait, no, the actual Kepler's third law is: (a_p)^3 / (P^2) = G (M_* + M_p) / (4 π² )

But since M_p << M_*, this becomes a_p³ ≈ [ G M_* P² ] / (4 π² )

But a_* is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit, which is a_p * (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) ) ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_*) ), again because M_* >> M_p.

So a_* ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_* )

Then, the star's velocity K is 2π a_* / P.

Substituting a_* gives K ≈ (2π a_p (M_p / M_* )) ) / P.

But from Kepler's law, a_p^3 = G M_* P² / (4 π² )

So a_p = [ G M_* P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting this into K:

K ≈ (2π / P) * [ ( G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p / M_* )

Let me compute this:

First, [ G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) = ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) )

So, K ≈ (2π / P ) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p / M_* )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let's factor out terms:

= (2 π ) / P * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * P^(2/3) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Combine the terms:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 -1) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Wait, 2π / P multiplied by P^(2/3) is P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3).

So:

= 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_* )

Now, let's simplify the constants:

2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Factor 4 as 2², so:

(4 π² )^(1/3) = (2² π² )^(1/3 ) ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3 )

So,

2 π / [ 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ] = [ 2 / 2^(2/3) ) ] * [ π / π^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

2 is 2^(1), so 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3 )

π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3) ) = π^(1/3 )

So overall, 2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So, putting it all together:

K = (2 π )^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3 ) * (M_p / M_* ) * P^(-1/3 )

Factor out the terms:

K = [ (2 π G M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * ( M_p / M_* ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, but M_* is the same for both stars. M_p is same for both planets. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ).

Hmm, so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

Therefore, K1 = 5 miliangstrom, K2 = 7 miliangstrom.

So K2 / K1 = 7 /5 = 1.4

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), then P is proportional to (K)⁻³.

Wait, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3 ), so P is proportional to (1/K )^3 = K^(-3 )

Therefore, the ratio of periods P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )³

Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), then P is proportional to K^(-3 )

So,

P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Given K1=5, K2=7,

K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143

Cube that: (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

Wait, so P2 is shorter than P1, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1?

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's shorter, so it's approximately 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 = 0.36, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. No, wait, that's not correct. Because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So the correct ratio is 0.36.

Wait, but wait. The options are A) 0.36, B) 1.4, C) 1.96, D) 0.85.

So according to this, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the answer would be A) ~0.36.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's double-check.

Given that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P = constant * (1/K )^3.

So, for planet #2, K2 =7, P2 = C*(1/7)^3.

For planet #1: K1=5, P1= C*(1/5)^3.

So the ratio P2 / P1 = [ (1/7)^3 / (1/5)^3 ] = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times as long as planet 1's period. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is, how many times is P2 longer than P1? So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( P \propto K^{-3} \). 

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #2),

the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

Answer: A
