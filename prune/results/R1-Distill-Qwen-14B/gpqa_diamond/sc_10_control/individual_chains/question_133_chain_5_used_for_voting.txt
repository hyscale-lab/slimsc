Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are four different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Wait, but how do these salts dissociate? Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but I guess that just contributes to the H2O in the solution.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can interconvert. I think the phosphate buffer system comes into play here. Since we're dealing with H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid, the species in solution can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. So I need to find the concentration of that.

Wait, but given that we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are adjacent in the phosphate ion series. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So the solution is a buffer solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I remember that in such cases, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question isn't directly about pH, but about [PO4^3-]. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the dissociation steps. Let me outline the dissociation steps for phosphoric acid:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So each step deprotonates to a further species. Now, the given salts are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are determined by the moles from each salt.

Wait, so maybe I should calculate the moles of each phosphate species present.

First, calculate moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me compute that.

177.99 is approximately 178. So 1/178 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

So, the solution has 0.007336 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how does this relate to the concentration of PO4^3-?

Hmm, perhaps I can model the HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.

The relevant reaction here is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Wait, but to find [PO4^3-], I might need to consider the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is buffered such that the pH is determined by the two phosphate species, and from that, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the system as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would allow us to calculate the pH first, and then use that pH to find [PO4^3-].

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the concentrations of each in the solution.

The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02809 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7. Since log(6.2)=0.7924, so 7 - 0.7924 ≈ 6.2076.

So pH = 6.2076 + log(0.02809 / 0.03668)

Compute the ratio: 0.02809 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 6.2076 - 0.113 ≈ 6.0946.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), where base is HPO4^2- (since it's the conjugate base of H2PO4^-), and acid is H2PO4^-.

So that seems right.

So the pH is about 6.095.

Now, with this pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

But wait, for this reaction, the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found using the pH. pH = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^(-pH).

pH is approximately 6.095, so [H+] = 10^(-6.095) ≈ 8.29e-7 M.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.29e-7)

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.29e-7.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.0562e-14 / 8.29e-7 ≈ 6.104e-8 M.

Wait, but wait, none of the options are 6.1e-8. The options are around 1e-7, like option A is 6.24e-7, which is about ten times higher.

Hmm, did I make a mistake here? Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating [H+].

Wait, pH is 6.095. So [H+] is 10^(-6.095) → let me compute that more accurately.

10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^0.095 is about 1.246 (since log(1.246)=0.095), so [H+]=1.246e-6 ≈ 1.25e-6.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 10^(-6.095) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.095).

10^(-6) is 1e-6. 10^(-0.095) is approximately 0.845. So [H+] ≈ 1e-6 * 0.845 = 8.45e-7 M.

Wait, so in my earlier calculation, I used 8.29e-7, which might be more precise. Let's recalculate.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.45e-7)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.45e-7.

So 5.0562e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.0e-8 M. But none of the options are that low. The options are all around 1e-7. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that [HPO4^2-] is not just the concentration from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, no, because the solution is in water, and the salts dissociate completely. So [HPO4^2-] is around 0.02809 M, but that's before any dissociation. So when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces PO4^3- and H+. But since HPO4^2- is a weak base, the amount that dissociates is small. So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, and [PO4^3-] is the small amount that comes from that.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the initial concentrations and the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more complicated because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and their equilibrium affects each other.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the third dissociation, considering the pH calculated from the buffer.

Wait, another approach: After finding the pH, which is around 6.095, for the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At this pH, [H+] is 8.45e-7 M.

So, using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

Which is what I did. But perhaps I need to account for the fact that [HPO4^2-] is not just from the initial Na2HPO4, because some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. Because H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in this solution, the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the buffer system is between those two. The PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating, which is a very small amount. So maybe I should just proceed with the calculation as I did.

Wait, but let's double-check my math.

Wait, [H+] is 8.45e-7 M.

So:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14.

Divided by 8.45e-7 → 5.056e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

But the options are all around 1e-7. So either I'm getting this wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so I can find the pH, then calculate the PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

Wait another thing: Maybe instead of using the pH from the buffer, I should calculate the [H+] considering all the species, including PO4^3-.

But that might complicate things because PO4^3- is present in very low concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total phosphate concentration and the different species.

Wait, another approach: The total phosphate concentration in the solution is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But since H3PO4 is a weak acid, and the solution is at pH around 6.1, which is higher than the first pKa (which is around 2.12, since pKa1= -log(7.5e-3)=2.12), so H3PO4 will have mostly dissociated into H2PO4^-.

Similarly, the pH is lower than the second pKa (pKa2=6.2076), so the solution is just below the second pKa. So the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the pH is very close to pKa2, which explains why the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, as I calculated earlier.

So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, the orthophosphate PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the [PO4^3-] will be small.

Let me try to compute [PO4^3-] again.

[H+] is 8.45e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.45e-7.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.45e-7: 5.056e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.0e-8 M. But the options are 6.24e-7, which is ten times larger. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, did I mix up the Ka values? Maybe I used the wrong Ka.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again. The Ka values are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, but when we're dealing with the third dissociation, that's the one that gives PO4^3-.

So the correct Ka to use is Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by the second dissociation, but the orthophosphate comes from the third.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can write the expression for the third dissociation in terms of the second dissociation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate ions and the distribution among the different forms.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the total concentration of all phosphate species, then find the fraction that is in the PO4^3- form.

But the total phosphate comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, the moles of phosphate from KH2PO4: each mole gives one H2PO4^-.

Moles = 1.00g /136.09g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one HPO4^2- per mole.

Moles = 1.00g /177.99g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.

So total phosphate moles = 0.007336 + 0.005618 = 0.012954 mol.

But then, considering the solution volume of 0.2 L, the total phosphate concentration is 0.012954 / 0.2 ≈ 0.06477 M.

But according to the phosphate species distribution, we can model the concentrations of each species based on the pH.

Wait, but I don't know the exact pH yet, but I can compute it from the buffer.

Wait, earlier, I calculated pH ≈6.095. Let's think about the distribution of phosphate species at that pH.

The distribution depends on the pH relative to pKa1, pKa2, pKa3.

But pH 6.095 is just below pKa2 (6.2076), so the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The fraction of each can be determined by the Henderson equation. The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, as I found.

But the question is about [PO4^3-], which is the species from the third dissociation.

So, to find [PO4^3-], I can consider the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 6.095, [H+] = 8.45e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.45e-7 ≈ (5.056e-14) / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

But this is 5.98e-8 M, which is about 6.0e-8 M. Looking at the options, the closest option is D) 3.97e-7 M, which is about six times higher. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is not just 0.02809 M, but that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+.

So the initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M. It dissociates as:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is quite small, so the dissociation isn't extensive.

The initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M. Let's let x be the amount that dissociates.

So, [H+] from this dissociation would be x, and [HPO4^2-] would increase by x.

But the solution also has some H+ from water and from the initial HPO4^2- dissociation.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things, as the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which I've already used to calculate the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the solution as a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and find the concentration of PO4^3- using that pH.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate whether the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M or if some comes from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, in the buffer solution, the majority of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, so the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2- is minimal compared to the initial concentrations. So perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M is correct.

Wait, maybe the issue is that I'm considering only the direct dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-, but perhaps the presence of H2PO4^- also contributes to the PO4^3- concentration through further dissociation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution requires using the third dissociation's K expression, but considering that [HPO4^2-] includes some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the solution is more accurately modeled by considering all species.

Another approach: The total phosphate in solution is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this case, the solution is prepared with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so we can ignore H3PO4, as it's a weak acid and the pH is higher than pKa1.

So, the total phosphate concentration is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.03668 + 0.02809 + x, where x is [PO4^3-].

But without knowing x, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps using the charge balance might help.

Charge balance in the solution: The positive ions are K+ and Na+. Let me compute their concentrations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So moles of K+ = moles of KH2PO4 = 0.007336 mol. Concentration is 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005618 = 0.011236 mol. Concentration is 0.011236 / 0.2 = 0.05618 M.

So total [cations] = [K+] + 2[Na+] = 0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904 M.

On the anion side: [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [OH^-] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.03668 + 0.02809 + x.

But [OH^-] is negligible because pH is around 6.1.

So, charge balance equation: [K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Wait, because each H2PO4^- is -1, each HPO4^2- is -2, and each PO4^3- is -3. So the charge from the phosphate species is:

[H2PO4^-]*(1) + [HPO4^2-]*(2) + [PO4^3-]*(3) = [K+] + 2[Na+].

Wait, let me write it correctly.

Charge balance: [K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Because each H2PO4^- has a charge of -1, each HPO4^2- is -2, and each PO4^3- is -3. And the positive ions are K+ (charge +1) and Na+ (charge +1).

So substituting the known concentrations:

0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-].

0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) + 3x.

Wait, compute left side: 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904.

Right side: 0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) + 3x → 0.03668 + 0.05618 = 0.09286 + 3x.

So equation: 0.14904 = 0.09286 + 3x → 0.14904 - 0.09286 = 3x → 0.05618 = 3x → x ≈ 0.01873 M.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply [PO4^3-] is about 0.01873 M, which is much higher than any of the options.

Wait, that can't be correct. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, the charge balance equation, perhaps. Let me recheck.

Charge balance equation: sum of positive charges = sum of negative charges.

Positive charges: [K+] + 2[Na+] = 0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904 M.

Negative charges: [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

But the [OH^-] is negligible at pH ~6.1.

So, 0.14904 = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in substituting the values.

Wait, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, and [PO4^3-] is x.

So:

0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) +3x = 0.14904.

Compute 0.03668 + 0.05618 = 0.09286. So 0.09286 +3x = 0.14904 → 3x=0.14904-0.09286=0.05618 → x=0.018727 M.

But that would mean [PO4^3-] is about 0.0187 M, which is way higher than any of the options given. That's impossible, because orthophosphate is a very weak base and should be present in much lower concentration.

So I must have made a mistake in the charge balance approach. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So the negative charge is:

(0.03668)(1) + (0.02809)(2) + (x)(3) + [OH^-].

Which is 0.03668 + 0.05618 + 3x + [OH^-].

Total positive charge is 0.14904.

So:

0.03668 + 0.05618 +3x ≈ 0.14904 → 0.09286 +3x =0.14904 → 3x=0.05618 → x=0.01873.

But that gives a high [PO4^3-], which contradicts the small Ka3. So perhaps the charge balance approach isn't the right way to go here.

Wait, maybe I should not assume that [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are their initial concentrations because some of them dissociate. But in reality, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not fixed because they can interconvert.

So perhaps the initial approach, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH, then using that pH to find [PO4^3-] is the correct method, and the problem is that the method gives a value not in the options, which suggests I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the [PO4^3-].

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.02809 M.

[H+]=8.45e-7.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.45e-7).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.45e-7.

So 5.0562e-14 / 8.45e-7 = approx 5.98e-8 M.

Which is 5.98e-8 M. But the options are all around 1e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Let me recalculate the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 → 136.09 g is one mole.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007336 mol.

So that's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol.

177.99 → 177.99 g is one mole.

1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for [H+].

pH =6.0946.

[H+] = 10^(-6.0946) → Let me compute it accurately.

We can write 6.0946 as 6 + 0.0946.

10^(-6) = 1e-6.

10^(-0.0946) → let's compute log(10^0.0946)=0.0946.

Wait, 10^0.0946 = approx 1.245.

Wait, no, wait. 10^x where x is negative.

Wait, 10^(-0.0946) = 1 / (10^0.0946).

10^0.0946 → let me compute this:

We know that log(1.245)=0.0946?

Wait, let me compute log(1.245).

Using log(1.2)=0.07918, log(1.24) = log(124/100)=log(1.24)=0.0936.

Wait, 1.24 → log(1.24)=0.0936.

So 10^0.0946 is approximately 1.245.

So 10^(-0.0946) is 1/1.245 ≈ 0.803.

So [H+] = 1e-6 * 0.803 = 8.03e-7.

So [H+] ≈ 8.03e-7.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.03e-7.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.03e-7: 5.056e-14 / 8.03e-7 = 6.295e-8 M.

Which is approximately 6.3e-8 M.

Still not matching any option. The options are:

A) 6.24e-7 → 6.24e-7 is ten times higher.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the equation for [PO4^3-]?

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Yes, so [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which I think I did correctly.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the HPO4^2- comes from both the salt and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but if I include that, I would have:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 + x, where x is the amount from H2PO4^- dissociation.

But with the initial assumption that x is small, perhaps we can ignore it, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model all the dissociations together.

Let me consider the system:

We have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H2PO4^- can dissociate to H+ and HPO4^2- (second dissociation).

HPO4^2- can dissociate to H+ and PO4^3- (third dissociation).

Let me denote the following:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a.

Let [HPO4^2-] = b.

Let [PO4^3-] = c.

We know that:

a + b + c = initial phosphate from the salts.

Wait, initial phosphate from the salts is 0.007336 +0.005618=0.012954 mol. In 0.2 L, that's 0.06477 M.

So a + b + c = 0.06477.

Also, considering charge balance, which I earlier tried but it led to a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the buffer equation can be used.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the buffer equation for pH and then calculate [PO4^3-}.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- is given by the product of the third dissociation's Ka and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So, [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]

Which is what I did.

But let me compute it again with the more precise [H+] value.

[H+] = 8.03e-7.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M.

So:

(1.8e-12) * (0.02809) / (8.03e-7) = (5.056e-14) / (8.03e-7) ≈6.299e-8 M.

Hmm, that's around 6.3e-8 M.

But the options are all much higher. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M is incorrect. Because some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but when considering that, let me think:

The initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03668 M. Let x be the amount that dissociates to HPO4^2-.

Then, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 -x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 + x.

But since Ka2 is small (6.2e-8), x would be small compared to 0.03668, so [H2PO4^-] ≈0.03668.

Similarly, [HPO4^2-] ≈0.02809.

But if I include the dissociation of H2PO4^-, the [HPO4^2-] would be higher than 0.02809, which would increase [PO4^3-].

Wait, but let's model it.

The second dissociation: H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

At pH 6.095, [H+] is 8.03e-7.

So, the dissociation of H2PO4^- would contribute to [HPO4^2-].

Let me set up the expression for Ka2.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

At equilibrium,

[H2PO4^-] ≈0.03668 - x ≈0.03668 (since x is small).

[HPO4^2-] ≈0.02809 +x.

[H+] =8.03e-7.

So,

Ka2 = (8.03e-7) (0.02809 +x) / (0.03668 -x) ≈ (8.03e-7 * 0.02809) / 0.03668.

Because x is small, so denominator ≈0.03668, numerator ≈8.03e-7 *0.02809.

Compute numerator: 8.03e-7 *0.02809 ≈2.257e-8.

Denominator: 0.03668.

So,

Ka2 ≈2.257e-8 /0.03668 ≈6.15e-7.

But given Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is much smaller than 6.15e-7.

So this suggests that the assumption that x is negligible is incorrect.

Wait, this implies that the dissociation of H2PO4^- is significant, which contradicts the earlier buffer assumption.

So, perhaps I need to account for the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

Let me let x be the concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

Then,

[H2PO4^-] =0.03668 -x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 +x.

[H+] =8.03e-7.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (8.03e-7)(0.02809 +x)/(0.03668 -x) =6.2e-8.

This is an equation in x.

Let me approximate x to be small compared to 0.02809 and 0.03668, so:

(8.03e-7)(0.02809) / 0.03668 ≈6.2e-8.

Compute left side: (8.03e-7 *0.02809) / 0.03668 = (2.257e-8) / 0.03668 ≈6.15e-7.

But this is much larger than Ka2=6.2e-8. So the assumption that x is small is invalid. Hence, x is not negligible, which complicates the matter.

Hmm, perhaps this calls for solving the equation without approximation.

Equation:

(8.03e-7)(0.02809 +x) =6.2e-8 (0.03668 -x).

Multiply both sides:

8.03e-7 *0.02809 +8.03e-7 x =6.2e-8 *0.03668 -6.2e-8 x.

Compute constants:

8.03e-7 *0.02809 ≈2.257e-8.

6.2e-8 *0.03668 ≈2.270e-9.

So:

2.257e-8 +8.03e-7 x =2.270e-9 -6.2e-8 x.

Bring all x terms to left and constants to right:

8.03e-7 x +6.2e-8 x =2.270e-9 -2.257e-8.

Factor x:

(8.03e-7 +6.2e-8) x = (2.270e-9 -2.257e-8).

Compute each term:

8.03e-7 =8.03e-7.

6.2e-8 =0.62e-7.

So sum is 8.65e-7.

Right side: 2.270e-9 -2.257e-8 = (0.227e-8 -2.257e-8) = (-2.03e-8).

So:

8.65e-7 x = -2.03e-8.

x = (-2.03e-8) / (8.65e-7) ≈-0.02346.

But x is negative, which doesn't make sense because x represents the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates, which can't be negative.

This suggests that either the approximation was wrong or there's another mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-}, which we calculated as pH≈6.095.

But if we include the dissociation of H2PO4^-, that would affect the pH, which would in turn affect the [PO4^3-}.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not sure how to proceed without more advanced methods.

An alternative approach: Perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, using the calculated pH, and to proceed with that.

Given that, and despite the options not matching, I'll proceed.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈6.3e-8 M. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, 1.00g of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 ≈0.007336 mol.

Which is correct.

1.00g of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol → 1.00/177.99≈0.005618 mol.

Yes.

So, I'm confident in the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should consider that the solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So, when calculating concentrations, it's moles divided by 0.2 L.

Yes, I did that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the closest would be option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [PO4^3-].

Wait, let me recompute [PO4^3-} using the more precise [H+].

[H+]=8.45e-7.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.45e-7.

Compute 1.8e-12 *0.02809 =5.056e-14.

Divide by8.45e-7 →5.056e-14 /8.45e-7 = approximately 5.98e-8 M.

Which is 5.98e-8 M.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

But perhaps the solution also considers the autoionization of water. But that's negligible at pH 6.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution has more phosphate species.

Wait, wait, another approach: The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, which depends on [HPO4^2-] and [H+].

But in reality, the [H+] also includes H+ from the third dissociation, which is negligible compared to the [H+] from water.

Thus, the [H+] is approximately 8.45e-7 M.

So, [PO4^3-} ≈5.98e-8 M.

But again, the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- as the product of the third dissociation and the concentration of HPO4^2- divided by [H+].

But perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is the sum of the initial Na2HPO4 and the dissociation from H2PO4^-.

But that complicates the matter, and considering time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I have.

Given that, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should have used the second dissociation to find pH, but used the third dissociation without considering that pH.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the orthophosphate is the sum of all phosphate species beyond HPO4^2-, which includes PO4^3-.

But that still doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the pH from the buffer, but the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the actual pH affects the third dissociation.

Wait, that is what I did. So I'm confident in that approach.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but considering the process, the closest is option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M, and the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) / [H+}.

Wait, let me compute [H+] again.

pH =6.095 → [H+] =10^-6.095 = approx 8.03e-7.

So, [PO4^3-} = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.03e-7.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02809 =5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.03e-7: 5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 ≈6.295e-8 →6.3e-8 M.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which species contribute to the orthophosphate.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate comes from the third dissociation, but the solution includes other sources, such as the autoionization of HPO4^2-.

But I think I have considered that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the molar concentrations of each species without considering the buffer, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of all phosphate species, including HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but that doesn't fit the question.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps and should recompute everything.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of phosphate.

Wait, moles of KH2PO4:0.007336 mol of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Total phosphate moles =0.007336 +0.005618=0.012954 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so total conc. is 0.06477 M.

But how much of that is in each form?

The buffer pH is 6.095, which is just below pKa2=6.2076.

So, the majority is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The fraction that is H2PO4^- is ( [HPO4^2-] / ([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]) ) = 0.02809/(0.02809+0.03668) ≈ 0.02809/0.06477 ≈0.433.

Similarly, H2PO4^- is 0.567 of the total phosphate.

But the question is about PO4^3-, which is a very small fraction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the concentration of PO4^3- using only the third dissociation, without considering the buffer.

But that doesn't make sense because the buffer determines the pH, which affects the [H+], which in turn affects [PO4^3-}.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the third dissociation directly, without considering the buffer.

But that would ignore the pH and the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a solution of HPO4^2- and find [PO4^3-} based on that.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M.

At pH 6.095, [H+}=8.03e-7.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-} = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) / [H+} = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.03e-7 =5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 ≈6.295e-8 M.

Which is 6.295e-8 M.

But the options are:

A) 6.24e-7 → 6.24e-7 is ten times higher.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, 5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 = (5.056 /8.03) × 10^(-14 +7) )= 0.6295 ×1e-7 =6.295e-8.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- considering all three dissociation steps, including the first and second.

But I'm not sure how that would be done.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the overall reaction from H3PO4 to PO4^3-.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the total phosphate concentration and the third dissociation's K to find [PO4^3-}.

But that would involve a more complex calculation with all species.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the calculated value, but since it's not matching any options, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the pH.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-}).

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, wait, no. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid}).

In this case, the base is HPO4^2-, the acid is H2PO4^-.

So pKa is pKa2=6.2076.

So:

pH =6.2076 + log(0.02809 / 0.03668).

Compute 0.02809 /0.03668=0.766.

Log(0.766)=approx -0.113.

So pH=6.2076-0.113=6.0946.

Which is correct.

So, [H+}=10^-6.0946≈8.03e-7.

Thus, the calculation of [PO4^3-} is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A) 6.24e-7, but that's ten times higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, perhaps the molar masses are different. Let me check.

KH2PO4: K=39.10, H2=2*1.008=2.016, P=30.97, O4=4*16=64. So total is 39.10+2.016+30.97+64=136.086 g/mol. The given Mw is 136.09, which is correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na=2*22.99=45.98, HPO4: H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64. So HPO4^3- is 96.978 g/mol. But considering the formula Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is (2*22.99) + (96.978) + (2*(18.015)) =45.98 +96.978 +36.03= 178.988 g/mol. The problem states 177.99, which is close but perhaps a typo. But I used 177.99 in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the Mw is 177.99, so 1.00g is 1/177.99=0.005618 mol.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the molarity of PO4^3- considering the contribution from both salts, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 3.97e-7 M, which is approximately half of 6.24e-7.

But without further insight, I'm stuck.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation reactions and relevant equilibrium constants (Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹²) are considered.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.005618}{0.2} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer system
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076\)  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02809}{0.03668} \approx 0.766
  \]  
- \(\log(0.766) \approx -0.113\)  
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.113 \approx 6.0946
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]  
The equilibrium constant is \(K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\). Using the expression:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-6.0946} \approx 8.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)  
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.03 \times 10^{-7}} \approx \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.03 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 6.295 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\) is approximately \(6.295 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**, which is about ten times higher than the calculated value. Despite this discrepancy, **A** is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are four different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Wait, but how do these salts dissociate? Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but I guess that just contributes to the H2O in the solution.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can interconvert. I think the phosphate buffer system comes into play here. Since we're dealing with H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid, the species in solution can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. So I need to find the concentration of that.

Wait, but given that we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are adjacent in the phosphate ion series. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So the solution is a buffer solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I remember that in such cases, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question isn't directly about pH, but about [PO4^3-]. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the dissociation steps. Let me outline the dissociation steps for phosphoric acid:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So each step deprotonates to a further species. Now, the given salts are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are determined by the moles from each salt.

Wait, so maybe I should calculate the moles of each phosphate species present.

First, calculate moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me compute that.

177.99 is approximately 178. So 1/178 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

So, the solution has 0.007336 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how does this relate to the concentration of PO4^3-?

Hmm, perhaps I can model the HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.

The relevant reaction here is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Wait, but to find [PO4^3-], I might need to consider the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is buffered such that the pH is determined by the two phosphate species, and from that, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the system as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would allow us to calculate the pH first, and then use that pH to find [PO4^3-].

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the concentrations of each in the solution.

The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02809 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7. Since log(6.2)=0.7924, so 7 - 0.7924 ≈ 6.2076.

So pH = 6.2076 + log(0.02809 / 0.03668)

Compute the ratio: 0.02809 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 6.2076 - 0.113 ≈ 6.0946.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), where base is HPO4^2- (since it's the conjugate base of H2PO4^-), and acid is H2PO4^-.

So that seems right.

So the pH is about 6.095.

Now, with this pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

But wait, for this reaction, the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found using the pH. pH = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^(-pH).

pH is approximately 6.095, so [H+] = 10^(-6.095) ≈ 8.29e-7 M.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.29e-7)

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.29e-7.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.0562e-14 / 8.29e-7 ≈ 6.104e-8 M.

Wait, but wait, none of the options are 6.1e-8. The options are around 1e-7, like option A is 6.24e-7, which is about ten times higher.

Hmm, did I make a mistake here? Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating [H+].

Wait, pH is 6.095. So [H+] is 10^(-6.095) → let me compute that more accurately.

10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^0.095 is about 1.246 (since log(1.246)=0.095), so [H+]=1.246e-6 ≈ 1.25e-6.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 10^(-6.095) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.095).

10^(-6) is 1e-6. 10^(-0.095) is approximately 0.845. So [H+] ≈ 1e-6 * 0.845 = 8.45e-7 M.

Wait, so in my earlier calculation, I used 8.29e-7, which might be more precise. Let's recalculate.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.45e-7)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.45e-7.

So 5.0562e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.0e-8 M. But none of the options are that low. The options are all around 1e-7. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that [HPO4^2-] is not just the concentration from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, no, because the solution is in water, and the salts dissociate completely. So [HPO4^2-] is around 0.02809 M, but that's before any dissociation. So when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces PO4^3- and H+. But since HPO4^2- is a weak base, the amount that dissociates is small. So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, and [PO4^3-] is the small amount that comes from that.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the initial concentrations and the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more complicated because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and their equilibrium affects each other.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the third dissociation, considering the pH calculated from the buffer.

Wait, another approach: After finding the pH, which is around 6.095, for the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At this pH, [H+] is 8.45e-7 M.

So, using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

Which is what I did. But perhaps I need to account for the fact that [HPO4^2-] is not just from the initial Na2HPO4, because some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. Because H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in this solution, the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the buffer system is between those two. The PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating, which is a very small amount. So maybe I should just proceed with the calculation as I did.

Wait, but let's double-check my math.

Wait, [H+] is 8.45e-7 M.

So:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14.

Divided by 8.45e-7 → 5.056e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

But the options are all around 1e-7. So either I'm getting this wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so I can find the pH, then calculate the PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

Wait another thing: Maybe instead of using the pH from the buffer, I should calculate the [H+] considering all the species, including PO4^3-.

But that might complicate things because PO4^3- is present in very low concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total phosphate concentration and the different species.

Wait, another approach: The total phosphate concentration in the solution is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But since H3PO4 is a weak acid, and the solution is at pH around 6.1, which is higher than the first pKa (which is around 2.12, since pKa1= -log(7.5e-3)=2.12), so H3PO4 will have mostly dissociated into H2PO4^-.

Similarly, the pH is lower than the second pKa (pKa2=6.2076), so the solution is just below the second pKa. So the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the pH is very close to pKa2, which explains why the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, as I calculated earlier.

So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, the orthophosphate PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the [PO4^3-] will be small.

Let me try to compute [PO4^3-] again.

[H+] is 8.45e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.45e-7.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.45e-7: 5.056e-14 / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.0e-8 M. But the options are 6.24e-7, which is ten times larger. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, did I mix up the Ka values? Maybe I used the wrong Ka.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again. The Ka values are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, but when we're dealing with the third dissociation, that's the one that gives PO4^3-.

So the correct Ka to use is Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by the second dissociation, but the orthophosphate comes from the third.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can write the expression for the third dissociation in terms of the second dissociation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate ions and the distribution among the different forms.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the total concentration of all phosphate species, then find the fraction that is in the PO4^3- form.

But the total phosphate comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, the moles of phosphate from KH2PO4: each mole gives one H2PO4^-.

Moles = 1.00g /136.09g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one HPO4^2- per mole.

Moles = 1.00g /177.99g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.

So total phosphate moles = 0.007336 + 0.005618 = 0.012954 mol.

But then, considering the solution volume of 0.2 L, the total phosphate concentration is 0.012954 / 0.2 ≈ 0.06477 M.

But according to the phosphate species distribution, we can model the concentrations of each species based on the pH.

Wait, but I don't know the exact pH yet, but I can compute it from the buffer.

Wait, earlier, I calculated pH ≈6.095. Let's think about the distribution of phosphate species at that pH.

The distribution depends on the pH relative to pKa1, pKa2, pKa3.

But pH 6.095 is just below pKa2 (6.2076), so the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The fraction of each can be determined by the Henderson equation. The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, as I found.

But the question is about [PO4^3-], which is the species from the third dissociation.

So, to find [PO4^3-], I can consider the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 6.095, [H+] = 8.45e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.45e-7 ≈ (5.056e-14) / 8.45e-7 ≈ 5.98e-8 M.

But this is 5.98e-8 M, which is about 6.0e-8 M. Looking at the options, the closest option is D) 3.97e-7 M, which is about six times higher. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is not just 0.02809 M, but that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+.

So the initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M. It dissociates as:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is quite small, so the dissociation isn't extensive.

The initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M. Let's let x be the amount that dissociates.

So, [H+] from this dissociation would be x, and [HPO4^2-] would increase by x.

But the solution also has some H+ from water and from the initial HPO4^2- dissociation.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things, as the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which I've already used to calculate the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the solution as a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and find the concentration of PO4^3- using that pH.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate whether the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M or if some comes from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, in the buffer solution, the majority of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, so the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2- is minimal compared to the initial concentrations. So perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M is correct.

Wait, maybe the issue is that I'm considering only the direct dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-, but perhaps the presence of H2PO4^- also contributes to the PO4^3- concentration through further dissociation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution requires using the third dissociation's K expression, but considering that [HPO4^2-] includes some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the solution is more accurately modeled by considering all species.

Another approach: The total phosphate in solution is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this case, the solution is prepared with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so we can ignore H3PO4, as it's a weak acid and the pH is higher than pKa1.

So, the total phosphate concentration is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.03668 + 0.02809 + x, where x is [PO4^3-].

But without knowing x, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps using the charge balance might help.

Charge balance in the solution: The positive ions are K+ and Na+. Let me compute their concentrations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So moles of K+ = moles of KH2PO4 = 0.007336 mol. Concentration is 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005618 = 0.011236 mol. Concentration is 0.011236 / 0.2 = 0.05618 M.

So total [cations] = [K+] + 2[Na+] = 0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904 M.

On the anion side: [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [OH^-] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.03668 + 0.02809 + x.

But [OH^-] is negligible because pH is around 6.1.

So, charge balance equation: [K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Wait, because each H2PO4^- is -1, each HPO4^2- is -2, and each PO4^3- is -3. So the charge from the phosphate species is:

[H2PO4^-]*(1) + [HPO4^2-]*(2) + [PO4^3-]*(3) = [K+] + 2[Na+].

Wait, let me write it correctly.

Charge balance: [K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Because each H2PO4^- has a charge of -1, each HPO4^2- is -2, and each PO4^3- is -3. And the positive ions are K+ (charge +1) and Na+ (charge +1).

So substituting the known concentrations:

0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-].

0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) + 3x.

Wait, compute left side: 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904.

Right side: 0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) + 3x → 0.03668 + 0.05618 = 0.09286 + 3x.

So equation: 0.14904 = 0.09286 + 3x → 0.14904 - 0.09286 = 3x → 0.05618 = 3x → x ≈ 0.01873 M.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply [PO4^3-] is about 0.01873 M, which is much higher than any of the options.

Wait, that can't be correct. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, the charge balance equation, perhaps. Let me recheck.

Charge balance equation: sum of positive charges = sum of negative charges.

Positive charges: [K+] + 2[Na+] = 0.03668 + 2*(0.05618) = 0.03668 + 0.11236 = 0.14904 M.

Negative charges: [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

But the [OH^-] is negligible at pH ~6.1.

So, 0.14904 = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in substituting the values.

Wait, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, and [PO4^3-] is x.

So:

0.03668 + 2*(0.02809) +3x = 0.14904.

Compute 0.03668 + 0.05618 = 0.09286. So 0.09286 +3x = 0.14904 → 3x=0.14904-0.09286=0.05618 → x=0.018727 M.

But that would mean [PO4^3-] is about 0.0187 M, which is way higher than any of the options given. That's impossible, because orthophosphate is a very weak base and should be present in much lower concentration.

So I must have made a mistake in the charge balance approach. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So the negative charge is:

(0.03668)(1) + (0.02809)(2) + (x)(3) + [OH^-].

Which is 0.03668 + 0.05618 + 3x + [OH^-].

Total positive charge is 0.14904.

So:

0.03668 + 0.05618 +3x ≈ 0.14904 → 0.09286 +3x =0.14904 → 3x=0.05618 → x=0.01873.

But that gives a high [PO4^3-], which contradicts the small Ka3. So perhaps the charge balance approach isn't the right way to go here.

Wait, maybe I should not assume that [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are their initial concentrations because some of them dissociate. But in reality, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not fixed because they can interconvert.

So perhaps the initial approach, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH, then using that pH to find [PO4^3-] is the correct method, and the problem is that the method gives a value not in the options, which suggests I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the [PO4^3-].

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.02809 M.

[H+]=8.45e-7.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.45e-7).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.45e-7.

So 5.0562e-14 / 8.45e-7 = approx 5.98e-8 M.

Which is 5.98e-8 M. But the options are all around 1e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Let me recalculate the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 → 136.09 g is one mole.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007336 mol.

So that's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol.

177.99 → 177.99 g is one mole.

1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for [H+].

pH =6.0946.

[H+] = 10^(-6.0946) → Let me compute it accurately.

We can write 6.0946 as 6 + 0.0946.

10^(-6) = 1e-6.

10^(-0.0946) → let's compute log(10^0.0946)=0.0946.

Wait, 10^0.0946 = approx 1.245.

Wait, no, wait. 10^x where x is negative.

Wait, 10^(-0.0946) = 1 / (10^0.0946).

10^0.0946 → let me compute this:

We know that log(1.245)=0.0946?

Wait, let me compute log(1.245).

Using log(1.2)=0.07918, log(1.24) = log(124/100)=log(1.24)=0.0936.

Wait, 1.24 → log(1.24)=0.0936.

So 10^0.0946 is approximately 1.245.

So 10^(-0.0946) is 1/1.245 ≈ 0.803.

So [H+] = 1e-6 * 0.803 = 8.03e-7.

So [H+] ≈ 8.03e-7.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.03e-7.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.03e-7: 5.056e-14 / 8.03e-7 = 6.295e-8 M.

Which is approximately 6.3e-8 M.

Still not matching any option. The options are:

A) 6.24e-7 → 6.24e-7 is ten times higher.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the equation for [PO4^3-]?

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Yes, so [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which I think I did correctly.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the HPO4^2- comes from both the salt and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but if I include that, I would have:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 + x, where x is the amount from H2PO4^- dissociation.

But with the initial assumption that x is small, perhaps we can ignore it, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model all the dissociations together.

Let me consider the system:

We have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H2PO4^- can dissociate to H+ and HPO4^2- (second dissociation).

HPO4^2- can dissociate to H+ and PO4^3- (third dissociation).

Let me denote the following:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a.

Let [HPO4^2-] = b.

Let [PO4^3-] = c.

We know that:

a + b + c = initial phosphate from the salts.

Wait, initial phosphate from the salts is 0.007336 +0.005618=0.012954 mol. In 0.2 L, that's 0.06477 M.

So a + b + c = 0.06477.

Also, considering charge balance, which I earlier tried but it led to a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the buffer equation can be used.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the buffer equation for pH and then calculate [PO4^3-}.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- is given by the product of the third dissociation's Ka and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So, [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]

Which is what I did.

But let me compute it again with the more precise [H+] value.

[H+] = 8.03e-7.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M.

So:

(1.8e-12) * (0.02809) / (8.03e-7) = (5.056e-14) / (8.03e-7) ≈6.299e-8 M.

Hmm, that's around 6.3e-8 M.

But the options are all much higher. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M is incorrect. Because some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but when considering that, let me think:

The initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03668 M. Let x be the amount that dissociates to HPO4^2-.

Then, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 -x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 + x.

But since Ka2 is small (6.2e-8), x would be small compared to 0.03668, so [H2PO4^-] ≈0.03668.

Similarly, [HPO4^2-] ≈0.02809.

But if I include the dissociation of H2PO4^-, the [HPO4^2-] would be higher than 0.02809, which would increase [PO4^3-].

Wait, but let's model it.

The second dissociation: H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

At pH 6.095, [H+] is 8.03e-7.

So, the dissociation of H2PO4^- would contribute to [HPO4^2-].

Let me set up the expression for Ka2.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

At equilibrium,

[H2PO4^-] ≈0.03668 - x ≈0.03668 (since x is small).

[HPO4^2-] ≈0.02809 +x.

[H+] =8.03e-7.

So,

Ka2 = (8.03e-7) (0.02809 +x) / (0.03668 -x) ≈ (8.03e-7 * 0.02809) / 0.03668.

Because x is small, so denominator ≈0.03668, numerator ≈8.03e-7 *0.02809.

Compute numerator: 8.03e-7 *0.02809 ≈2.257e-8.

Denominator: 0.03668.

So,

Ka2 ≈2.257e-8 /0.03668 ≈6.15e-7.

But given Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is much smaller than 6.15e-7.

So this suggests that the assumption that x is negligible is incorrect.

Wait, this implies that the dissociation of H2PO4^- is significant, which contradicts the earlier buffer assumption.

So, perhaps I need to account for the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

Let me let x be the concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

Then,

[H2PO4^-] =0.03668 -x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 +x.

[H+] =8.03e-7.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (8.03e-7)(0.02809 +x)/(0.03668 -x) =6.2e-8.

This is an equation in x.

Let me approximate x to be small compared to 0.02809 and 0.03668, so:

(8.03e-7)(0.02809) / 0.03668 ≈6.2e-8.

Compute left side: (8.03e-7 *0.02809) / 0.03668 = (2.257e-8) / 0.03668 ≈6.15e-7.

But this is much larger than Ka2=6.2e-8. So the assumption that x is small is invalid. Hence, x is not negligible, which complicates the matter.

Hmm, perhaps this calls for solving the equation without approximation.

Equation:

(8.03e-7)(0.02809 +x) =6.2e-8 (0.03668 -x).

Multiply both sides:

8.03e-7 *0.02809 +8.03e-7 x =6.2e-8 *0.03668 -6.2e-8 x.

Compute constants:

8.03e-7 *0.02809 ≈2.257e-8.

6.2e-8 *0.03668 ≈2.270e-9.

So:

2.257e-8 +8.03e-7 x =2.270e-9 -6.2e-8 x.

Bring all x terms to left and constants to right:

8.03e-7 x +6.2e-8 x =2.270e-9 -2.257e-8.

Factor x:

(8.03e-7 +6.2e-8) x = (2.270e-9 -2.257e-8).

Compute each term:

8.03e-7 =8.03e-7.

6.2e-8 =0.62e-7.

So sum is 8.65e-7.

Right side: 2.270e-9 -2.257e-8 = (0.227e-8 -2.257e-8) = (-2.03e-8).

So:

8.65e-7 x = -2.03e-8.

x = (-2.03e-8) / (8.65e-7) ≈-0.02346.

But x is negative, which doesn't make sense because x represents the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates, which can't be negative.

This suggests that either the approximation was wrong or there's another mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-}, which we calculated as pH≈6.095.

But if we include the dissociation of H2PO4^-, that would affect the pH, which would in turn affect the [PO4^3-}.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not sure how to proceed without more advanced methods.

An alternative approach: Perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, using the calculated pH, and to proceed with that.

Given that, and despite the options not matching, I'll proceed.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈6.3e-8 M. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, 1.00g of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 ≈0.007336 mol.

Which is correct.

1.00g of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol → 1.00/177.99≈0.005618 mol.

Yes.

So, I'm confident in the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should consider that the solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So, when calculating concentrations, it's moles divided by 0.2 L.

Yes, I did that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the closest would be option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [PO4^3-].

Wait, let me recompute [PO4^3-} using the more precise [H+].

[H+]=8.45e-7.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.45e-7.

Compute 1.8e-12 *0.02809 =5.056e-14.

Divide by8.45e-7 →5.056e-14 /8.45e-7 = approximately 5.98e-8 M.

Which is 5.98e-8 M.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

But perhaps the solution also considers the autoionization of water. But that's negligible at pH 6.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution has more phosphate species.

Wait, wait, another approach: The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, which depends on [HPO4^2-] and [H+].

But in reality, the [H+] also includes H+ from the third dissociation, which is negligible compared to the [H+] from water.

Thus, the [H+] is approximately 8.45e-7 M.

So, [PO4^3-} ≈5.98e-8 M.

But again, the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- as the product of the third dissociation and the concentration of HPO4^2- divided by [H+].

But perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is the sum of the initial Na2HPO4 and the dissociation from H2PO4^-.

But that complicates the matter, and considering time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I have.

Given that, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should have used the second dissociation to find pH, but used the third dissociation without considering that pH.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the orthophosphate is the sum of all phosphate species beyond HPO4^2-, which includes PO4^3-.

But that still doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the pH from the buffer, but the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the actual pH affects the third dissociation.

Wait, that is what I did. So I'm confident in that approach.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but considering the process, the closest is option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M, and the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) / [H+}.

Wait, let me compute [H+] again.

pH =6.095 → [H+] =10^-6.095 = approx 8.03e-7.

So, [PO4^3-} = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.03e-7.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02809 =5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.03e-7: 5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 ≈6.295e-8 →6.3e-8 M.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which species contribute to the orthophosphate.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate comes from the third dissociation, but the solution includes other sources, such as the autoionization of HPO4^2-.

But I think I have considered that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the molar concentrations of each species without considering the buffer, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of all phosphate species, including HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but that doesn't fit the question.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps and should recompute everything.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of phosphate.

Wait, moles of KH2PO4:0.007336 mol of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Total phosphate moles =0.007336 +0.005618=0.012954 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so total conc. is 0.06477 M.

But how much of that is in each form?

The buffer pH is 6.095, which is just below pKa2=6.2076.

So, the majority is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The fraction that is H2PO4^- is ( [HPO4^2-] / ([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]) ) = 0.02809/(0.02809+0.03668) ≈ 0.02809/0.06477 ≈0.433.

Similarly, H2PO4^- is 0.567 of the total phosphate.

But the question is about PO4^3-, which is a very small fraction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the concentration of PO4^3- using only the third dissociation, without considering the buffer.

But that doesn't make sense because the buffer determines the pH, which affects the [H+], which in turn affects [PO4^3-}.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the third dissociation directly, without considering the buffer.

But that would ignore the pH and the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a solution of HPO4^2- and find [PO4^3-} based on that.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M.

At pH 6.095, [H+}=8.03e-7.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-} = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) / [H+} = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.03e-7 =5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 ≈6.295e-8 M.

Which is 6.295e-8 M.

But the options are:

A) 6.24e-7 → 6.24e-7 is ten times higher.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, 5.056e-14 /8.03e-7 = (5.056 /8.03) × 10^(-14 +7) )= 0.6295 ×1e-7 =6.295e-8.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- considering all three dissociation steps, including the first and second.

But I'm not sure how that would be done.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the overall reaction from H3PO4 to PO4^3-.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the total phosphate concentration and the third dissociation's K to find [PO4^3-}.

But that would involve a more complex calculation with all species.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the calculated value, but since it's not matching any options, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the pH.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-}).

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, wait, no. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid}).

In this case, the base is HPO4^2-, the acid is H2PO4^-.

So pKa is pKa2=6.2076.

So:

pH =6.2076 + log(0.02809 / 0.03668).

Compute 0.02809 /0.03668=0.766.

Log(0.766)=approx -0.113.

So pH=6.2076-0.113=6.0946.

Which is correct.

So, [H+}=10^-6.0946≈8.03e-7.

Thus, the calculation of [PO4^3-} is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A) 6.24e-7, but that's ten times higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, perhaps the molar masses are different. Let me check.

KH2PO4: K=39.10, H2=2*1.008=2.016, P=30.97, O4=4*16=64. So total is 39.10+2.016+30.97+64=136.086 g/mol. The given Mw is 136.09, which is correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na=2*22.99=45.98, HPO4: H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64. So HPO4^3- is 96.978 g/mol. But considering the formula Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is (2*22.99) + (96.978) + (2*(18.015)) =45.98 +96.978 +36.03= 178.988 g/mol. The problem states 177.99, which is close but perhaps a typo. But I used 177.99 in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the Mw is 177.99, so 1.00g is 1/177.99=0.005618 mol.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the molarity of PO4^3- considering the contribution from both salts, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 3.97e-7 M, which is approximately half of 6.24e-7.

But without further insight, I'm stuck.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation reactions and relevant equilibrium constants (Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹²) are considered.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.005618}{0.2} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer system
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076\)  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02809}{0.03668} \approx 0.766
  \]  
- \(\log(0.766) \approx -0.113\)  
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.113 \approx 6.0946
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]  
The equilibrium constant is \(K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\). Using the expression:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-6.0946} \approx 8.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)  
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.03 \times 10^{-7}} \approx \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.03 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 6.295 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\) is approximately \(6.295 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**, which is about ten times higher than the calculated value. Despite this discrepancy, **A** is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

ANSWER: A
