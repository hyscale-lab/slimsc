Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to figure out how much of that is present in the solution given the specific amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O added.

Let me read the problem again to get all the details. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1000 cm³ is a liter. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so it's probably at standard conditions.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. I remember that these are the dissociation constants for the successive deprotonations of phosphoric acid.

So, the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt in the solution. Let's do that.

For KH2PO4 (let's call it salt A), the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol. Let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles.

Next, for Na2HPO4·2H2O (salt B), the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Wait, let me do that calculation precisely. 1 divided by 177.99 is about 0.00561 moles.

Now, the solution's volume is 0.2 liters, so the concentrations (molarity) would be moles divided by volume.

So for salt A: 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M (approximate). Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.00734 divided by 0.2 is 0.0367 M.

Salt B: 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M. Let me compute 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, what do these salts dissociate into in solution?

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion).

Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). But wait, the salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Does the water affect anything? Probably not, because the formula accounts for the waters of crystallization. So, each formula unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But we're asked about orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form. So how do these ions contribute to that?

I remember that in solution, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. But the process is governed by the Ka values.

The equilibrium reactions are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-     Ka1 = 7.5e-3
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-   Ka2 = 6.2e-8
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-     Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. The H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2-, and the HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3-.

But since both salts are present, the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we need the concentration of PO4^3-.

Hmm, so how much of HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-?

Since the Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the extent of dissociation will be very low. So the concentration of PO4^3- will be small compared to HPO4^2-.

But how to calculate it?

I think we can set up an equilibrium expression for the last deprotonation step.

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The initial concentrations are determined by the two salts. Let's calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

From salt A: KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-; so [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

From salt B: Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-; so [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So, initially, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

PO4^3- starts at zero.

But wait, the H2PO4^- can react with HPO4^2-? Or more accurately, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

But considering the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the pKa2, I suppose, because that's where the predominant species are.

Wait, the pH of the solution will influence how much of each phosphate species is present. But the problem doesn't give a pH; it's expecting us to calculate the PO4^3- concentration based on the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the system considering the equilibria.

But since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But how does that help us find PO4^3-?

Wait, perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

So we can write the equilibrium for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

The initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M.

The change would be x (for PO4^3-), and the H+ would also be x, assuming it's a monoprotic dissociation.

So the equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

But we need to find [PO4^3-], which is x. But we don't know [H+]. So perhaps we can find [H+] from the buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, yes. Because the buffer system H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- would determine the pH, which in turn affects the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

So first, calculate the pH of the buffer solution. The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation step (Ka2).

The buffer equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where A^- is HPO4^2-, and HA is H2PO4^-.

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = approximately 7.208 (since log(6.2)=0.792, so 8 - 0.792 =7.208).

Wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the concentrations:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

So log(0.02805/0.0367) = log(0.7645) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.114 =7.094.

So the pH is approximately 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-0.094) is approximately 0.823. So 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

[H+] = 8.23e-8

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.23e-8) = ?

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8

So 5.049e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approximately 6.13e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.13e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the buffer pH calculation.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) is approximately log(0.76) = -0.117. So maybe I should use more precise calculation.

Log(0.7645) is approximately -0.114, as I did before.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 =7.094.

[H+] is 1e-7.094.

Wait, 7.094 is 7 + 0.094.

10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.094 is approximately 0.823 (since 10^0.094 ≈ 1.237, so reciprocal is ~0.81).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 10^(-0.094):

Let me think of 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794. But 0.094 is a bit less than 0.1.

So 10^-0.094 ≈ 0.816 (since 0.094/0.1 = 0.94, so 0.794 * (1 - 0.06) ≈ 0.794 *0.94 ≈ 0.75.)

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute using natural logs.

But perhaps it's easier to just accept that 10^-7.094 is about 8.2e-8 as I thought.

So back to [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ) / (8.2e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.2e-8 = (5.049/8.2) *1e-6.

5.049 /8.2 ≈ 0.6155.

So 0.6155e-6 is 6.155e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7

Option B)5.48e-7

Option D)3.97e-7

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.15e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but not exactly. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute the initial concentrations more precisely.

Moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 = 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 = 0.00561 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 /0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 /0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, buffer pH calculation:

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 /0.0367 = approximately 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) = ?

Log(0.7645) = log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) -1.

Log(7.645) is approx 0.884.

So log(0.7645) = 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.116) =7.0916.

So [H+] =10^(-7.0916).

Compute 10^(-7.0916) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0916).

10^(-0.0916) is approximately 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123, but 0.0916 is a bit more. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using log tables or calculator approximation:

What is 10^(-0.0916)?

We can use the fact that ln(10^x) =x * ln(10), but maybe a better approach is to use Taylor expansion or remember that 10^0.0916 ≈1.237 (since 10^0.09 is around 1.23, 10^0.0916 is about 1.237).

So 10^(-0.0916) =1/1.237 ≈0.8076.

So [H+] =1e-7 * 0.8076 =8.076e-8 M.

Wait, wait, no: 10^(-7.0916) = (10^-7) * (10^-0.0916) )= (1e-7 ) * (0.8076) )= 8.076e-8 M.

So [H+] =8.076e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M

[H+] =8.076e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) /8.076e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 =5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.076e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.076e-8 = (5.049 /8.076) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.076 = approximately 0.6255.

So 0.6255e-6 =6.255e-7 M.

Which is about 6.255e-7, so around 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, another thing to consider: does the presence of H2PO4^- affect the [PO4^3-] via the HPO4^2- equilibrium?

I think I have considered all steps correctly. The H2PO4^- contributes to the buffer, determining the pH, which in turn affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

So, the calculated [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.25e-7, which matches option A (6.24e-7), so probably that's the correct answer.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species in the presence of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, which participate in the following equilibria:

1. **Buffer System (H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻):**  
   The pH of the solution is determined by the buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
   \]  
   Substituting the given concentrations:  
   \[
   [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right).
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.7645) \approx 7.2076 - 0.114 = 7.0936.
   \]  
   From the pH, the hydrogen ion concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0936} \approx 8.076 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻:**  
   The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), using the equilibrium expression:  
   \[
   K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.076 \times 10^{-8}}.
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.076 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ (\( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)) is closest to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to figure out how much of that is present in the solution given the specific amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O added.

Let me read the problem again to get all the details. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1000 cm³ is a liter. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so it's probably at standard conditions.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. I remember that these are the dissociation constants for the successive deprotonations of phosphoric acid.

So, the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt in the solution. Let's do that.

For KH2PO4 (let's call it salt A), the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol. Let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles.

Next, for Na2HPO4·2H2O (salt B), the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Wait, let me do that calculation precisely. 1 divided by 177.99 is about 0.00561 moles.

Now, the solution's volume is 0.2 liters, so the concentrations (molarity) would be moles divided by volume.

So for salt A: 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M (approximate). Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.00734 divided by 0.2 is 0.0367 M.

Salt B: 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M. Let me compute 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, what do these salts dissociate into in solution?

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion).

Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). But wait, the salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Does the water affect anything? Probably not, because the formula accounts for the waters of crystallization. So, each formula unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But we're asked about orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form. So how do these ions contribute to that?

I remember that in solution, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. But the process is governed by the Ka values.

The equilibrium reactions are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-     Ka1 = 7.5e-3
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-   Ka2 = 6.2e-8
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-     Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. The H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2-, and the HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3-.

But since both salts are present, the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we need the concentration of PO4^3-.

Hmm, so how much of HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-?

Since the Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the extent of dissociation will be very low. So the concentration of PO4^3- will be small compared to HPO4^2-.

But how to calculate it?

I think we can set up an equilibrium expression for the last deprotonation step.

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The initial concentrations are determined by the two salts. Let's calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

From salt A: KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-; so [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

From salt B: Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-; so [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So, initially, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

PO4^3- starts at zero.

But wait, the H2PO4^- can react with HPO4^2-? Or more accurately, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

But considering the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the pKa2, I suppose, because that's where the predominant species are.

Wait, the pH of the solution will influence how much of each phosphate species is present. But the problem doesn't give a pH; it's expecting us to calculate the PO4^3- concentration based on the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the system considering the equilibria.

But since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But how does that help us find PO4^3-?

Wait, perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

So we can write the equilibrium for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

The initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M.

The change would be x (for PO4^3-), and the H+ would also be x, assuming it's a monoprotic dissociation.

So the equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

But we need to find [PO4^3-], which is x. But we don't know [H+]. So perhaps we can find [H+] from the buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, yes. Because the buffer system H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- would determine the pH, which in turn affects the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

So first, calculate the pH of the buffer solution. The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation step (Ka2).

The buffer equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where A^- is HPO4^2-, and HA is H2PO4^-.

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = approximately 7.208 (since log(6.2)=0.792, so 8 - 0.792 =7.208).

Wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the concentrations:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

So log(0.02805/0.0367) = log(0.7645) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.114 =7.094.

So the pH is approximately 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-0.094) is approximately 0.823. So 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

[H+] = 8.23e-8

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.23e-8) = ?

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8

So 5.049e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approximately 6.13e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.13e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the buffer pH calculation.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) is approximately log(0.76) = -0.117. So maybe I should use more precise calculation.

Log(0.7645) is approximately -0.114, as I did before.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 =7.094.

[H+] is 1e-7.094.

Wait, 7.094 is 7 + 0.094.

10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.094 is approximately 0.823 (since 10^0.094 ≈ 1.237, so reciprocal is ~0.81).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 10^(-0.094):

Let me think of 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794. But 0.094 is a bit less than 0.1.

So 10^-0.094 ≈ 0.816 (since 0.094/0.1 = 0.94, so 0.794 * (1 - 0.06) ≈ 0.794 *0.94 ≈ 0.75.)

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute using natural logs.

But perhaps it's easier to just accept that 10^-7.094 is about 8.2e-8 as I thought.

So back to [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ) / (8.2e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.2e-8 = (5.049/8.2) *1e-6.

5.049 /8.2 ≈ 0.6155.

So 0.6155e-6 is 6.155e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7

Option B)5.48e-7

Option D)3.97e-7

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.15e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but not exactly. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute the initial concentrations more precisely.

Moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 = 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 = 0.00561 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 /0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 /0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, buffer pH calculation:

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 /0.0367 = approximately 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) = ?

Log(0.7645) = log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) -1.

Log(7.645) is approx 0.884.

So log(0.7645) = 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.116) =7.0916.

So [H+] =10^(-7.0916).

Compute 10^(-7.0916) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0916).

10^(-0.0916) is approximately 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123, but 0.0916 is a bit more. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using log tables or calculator approximation:

What is 10^(-0.0916)?

We can use the fact that ln(10^x) =x * ln(10), but maybe a better approach is to use Taylor expansion or remember that 10^0.0916 ≈1.237 (since 10^0.09 is around 1.23, 10^0.0916 is about 1.237).

So 10^(-0.0916) =1/1.237 ≈0.8076.

So [H+] =1e-7 * 0.8076 =8.076e-8 M.

Wait, wait, no: 10^(-7.0916) = (10^-7) * (10^-0.0916) )= (1e-7 ) * (0.8076) )= 8.076e-8 M.

So [H+] =8.076e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M

[H+] =8.076e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) /8.076e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 =5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.076e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.076e-8 = (5.049 /8.076) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.076 = approximately 0.6255.

So 0.6255e-6 =6.255e-7 M.

Which is about 6.255e-7, so around 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, another thing to consider: does the presence of H2PO4^- affect the [PO4^3-] via the HPO4^2- equilibrium?

I think I have considered all steps correctly. The H2PO4^- contributes to the buffer, determining the pH, which in turn affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

So, the calculated [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.25e-7, which matches option A (6.24e-7), so probably that's the correct answer.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species in the presence of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, which participate in the following equilibria:

1. **Buffer System (H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻):**  
   The pH of the solution is determined by the buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
   \]  
   Substituting the given concentrations:  
   \[
   [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right).
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.7645) \approx 7.2076 - 0.114 = 7.0936.
   \]  
   From the pH, the hydrogen ion concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0936} \approx 8.076 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻:**  
   The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), using the equilibrium expression:  
   \[
   K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.076 \times 10^{-8}}.
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.076 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ (\( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)) is closest to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
