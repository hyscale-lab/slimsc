Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the nucleus splits into two or more parts. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the difference between the relativistic and classical calculations.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and is at rest. Then it spontaneously fissions into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So that means the total mass after fission is 0.99 M. 

Wait, wait. So the initial rest mass is M, but after fission, the combined rest mass is 0.99 M. That means some mass has been converted into energy, like kinetic energy or other forms. So the mass defect would be 1% of M, but wait, 300 GeV is the rest mass energy. So initial energy is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV. That's the total energy available for kinetic energy and other things like binding energy, but the problem ignores electrons, so maybe not much to worry about other than kinetic.

So the two fragments: their masses are in a ratio of 2:1. Let me say the smaller mass is m, so the larger is 2m. The sum is 3m. And 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3. Wait, but M is the initial mass, which is the rest mass before fission. So M = 300 GeV / c², but maybe c=1 in these units. So m = 0.33 M. No, wait, 3m =0.99 M → m=0.33 M? No, wait, 3m=0.99 M → m=0.33 M? Wait, no:

Wait, 3m =0.99 M → m= (0.99 /3) M → m ≈ 0.33 M. So m is roughly a third of M? Or wait, M is 300 GeV/c², so 0.99 M is 297 GeV/c². So each fragment's rest mass is 99 GeV/c² and 198 GeV/c². Because 2m + m =3m=297 GeV/c². So the smaller fragment is 99 GeV/c², the larger is 198 GeV/c². So their rest masses add up correctly.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then compare the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations of T1.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So I have to compute T1 rel and T1 class, subtract them, and find which option it is.

So, first, let's model the problem.

Total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E1 = (m1 c²) + K1, E2 = (m2 c²) + K2.

But since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite. So p1 = -p2.

In relativity, the energy of a fragment is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, for fragment 1 (mass m1=198 GeV/c², assuming c=1), E1² = p^2 + (198)^2.

Fragment 2 (m2=99 GeV/c²), E2² = p^2 + (99)^2.

But wait, the momentum magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite. So p1 = p, p2 = -p. But the energies are E1 and E2.

Also, the sum of the energies E1 + E2 must equal the initial energy, which was 300 GeV. Because energy is conserved.

So:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1² = p² + (198)^2,

E2² = p² + (99)^2.

We can write E1 = sqrt(p² + 198²),

E2 = sqrt(p² + 99²).

So,

sqrt(p² + 198²) + sqrt(p² + 99²) = 300.

We need to solve for p.

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. Perhaps we can square both sides.

Let me denote A = sqrt(p^2 +198^2), B= sqrt(p^2 +99^2).

So A + B =300.

Square both sides:

(A + B)^2 = 300^2 → A² + 2AB + B² =90000.

But A² = p^2 + 198²,

B² = p^2 + 99².

So,

(p² + 198²) + 2AB + (p² +99²) = 90000.

Combine terms:

2 p² + (198² +99²) + 2AB =90000.

Let's compute 198² and 99²:

198^2 = (200-2)^2= 40000 - 800 +4=39204.

99^2=9801.

So sum is 39204 +9801=49005.

So,

2 p² + 49005 + 2AB =90000.

So,

2 p² +2AB = 90000 -49005=40995.

Divide both sides by 2:

p² + AB = 20497.5.

Hmm. Now, what's AB?

AB = sqrt( (p^2 +198²)(p^2 +99²) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me call p^2 = x.

So,

x + AB = 20497.5.

But AB = sqrt( (x + 198²)(x +99²) )

This seems complicated. Maybe we can find another equation.

Alternatively, let's subtract the energies:

E1 - E2 = (sqrt(x +198²) - sqrt(x +99²)).

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to make an approximation. Wait, but the problem says to find the difference between relativistic and classical calculations. So perhaps the non-relativistic approach would give a different T1, and the relativistic approach gives a different value, and the difference is one of the options.

Wait, but let's think about the classical approach first. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

In that approximation, the total kinetic energy plus rest mass would be the initial energy.

Wait, no, the non-relativistic case assumes that the mass doesn't change. Wait, no, the rest mass changes, but in the non-relativistic approach, perhaps they ignore the mass change, but the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps the non-relativistic calculation would assume that the masses are the same as the rest masses, but that the kinetic energy is from the mass change.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, in classical physics, momentum is conserved, and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2 for each fragment.

Let me think about the non-relativistic approach.

In non-relativistic, the total momentum after fission is zero, so each fragment has momentum p and -p. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude.

But in non-relativistic, p = m v.

So for fragment 1: p = m1 v1.

Fragment 2: p = m2 v2.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, v1 = -v2.

Wait, no, because the momenta must be opposite, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Wait, but in non-relativistic, the velocities would be v1 and v2, and p1 = m1 v1, p2= m2 v2.

Conservation of momentum: m1 v1 + m2 v2 =0 → m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

So, v2 = -(m1/m2) v1.

But since m1=2m2 (because m1 is twice as massive as m2), then v2= -(2m2/m2) v1 → v2= -2 v1.

So fragment 1 has velocity v, fragment 2 has velocity -2v.

Then, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is (1/2) m1 v^2.

Fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m2 (2v)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v² = 2 m2 v².

So total KE (non-relativistic) would be:

(1/2) m1 v² + 2 m2 v².

But m1=2 m2, so substituting:

(1/2)(2 m2) v² + 2 m2 v² = m2 v² + 2 m2 v² = 3 m2 v².

Now, the total energy is the initial energy, which is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. But in non-relativistic, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies (assuming no mass change) plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but after fission, the rest energies are m1 c² and m2 c². Since the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 *300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV.

So in non-relativistic, the rest energy is 297 GeV, and the kinetic energy is 3 m2 v².

So the total energy is 297 + 3 m2 v² =300 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v² =3 GeV.

Thus,

m2 v²= 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². Wait, but in non-relativistic, the mass is constant. Hmm, but units are a bit tricky since we're mixing GeV and c=1 units.

Wait, perhaps I should set c=1 for simplicity, so that E=mc² is E= m * c² → E= m when c=1, but units are in GeV.

So, m2 is 99 GeV/c², but if c=1, then E= m in units where c=1. So E2_rest = m2 =99 GeV.

So, in non-relativistic:

Total KE =3 m2 v² =3 GeV.

So,

3 * (99 GeV) * v² = 3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, m2 is 99 GeV/c². But with c=1, m2 is 99 GeV.

So,

3 * m2 * v² =3 GeV → 3 *99 GeV *v² =3 GeV → 99 v² =3 /3 → v²= (1 GeV)/(99 GeV) → v²=1/99 → v= 1/sqrt(99) ≈0.1 c.

So the velocity is about 0.1c, which is non-relativistic.

So the KE of fragment 1, which is the more massive one, is (1/2) m1 v².

m1=198 GeV.

So,

KE1 = 0.5 *198 GeV * (1/99) → 0.5 * 198 /99 → 0.5 * 2 =1 GeV.

So T1_classical =1 GeV =1000 MeV.

Wait, that's 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are in MeV, and the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. Hmm, that suggests I'm missing something. Because according to this, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are nowhere near that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the calculation is different. Let me think again.

Wait, in the non-relativistic approach, the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect of 3 GeV. So the total KE is 3 GeV, split between the two fragments in a way that depends on their masses.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives T1_classical as 1 GeV. But the options are in MeV, so maybe I messed up the units? Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial mass is 300 GeV. The sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. So the total KE is 3 GeV.

But according to the earlier calculation, in non-relativistic, the more massive fragment has 1 GeV KE, and the lighter has 2 GeV KE. But that adds up to 3 GeV, so that's correct.

But the problem is about the difference between the relativistic and the classical T1. So I need to find T1_rel and T1_class, then compute T1_rel - T1_class, or vice versa.

Wait, but the relativistic approach is going to give a different T1. Because in reality, the kinetic energy is not just (1/2)mv². So I need to calculate the relativistic T1.

So, let's go back to the relativistic approach.

We have E1 + E2=300 GeV.

E1² = p² + m1² → (E1)^2 = p² + (198)^2.

E2² = p² + (99)^2.

And E1 + E2=300.

We can write E2=300 - E1.

So,

(300 - E1)^2 = p² + (99)^2.

But,

E1² = p² + 198².

Subtracting the two equations,

(300 - E1)^2 - E1² = (99)^2 - (198)^2.

Expand (300-E1)^2:

= 90000 - 600 E1 + E1^2 - E1^2 = 90000 -600 E1.

So,

90000 -600 E1 = (99)^2 - (198)^2.

Compute RHS:

99²=9801, 198²=39204.

So,

9801 -39204= -29403.

So,

90000 -600 E1 = -29403.

→ 90000 +29403 =600 E1.

→ 119403=600 E1.

→ E1=119403 /600 ≈199.005 GeV.

So E1≈199.005 GeV.

E2=300-199.005=100.995 GeV.

Now, E1² =p² +198^2 → (199.005)^2 = p² + 39204.

199.005^2 ≈ (200 -0.995)^2 = 40000 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2 ≈40000 - 398 +1 → approx 39603.

Wait, but more accurately, 199.005 *199.005:

= (200 -0.995)^2 = 200^2 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2.

=40000 - 398 + 0.990025.

=40000 -398=39602; 39602 +0.990025≈39602.99.

So,

39602.99 ≈ p² +39204 → p²=39602.99-39204=398.99 ≈399 GeV².

So p≈sqrt(399) ≈19.975 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is E1 - m1 =199.005 -198=1.005 GeV.

So T1_rel≈1.005 GeV.

In the classical approach, T1_class is 1 GeV.

So the difference is 1.005 GeV -1 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is about 1.005 GeV, and the classical T1 is 1 GeV. So the difference is 5 MeV. So the correct T1 is higher by approximately 5 MeV.

Wait, but the problem says, "the difference between the correct T1 value and T1 value calculated using classical approximation." So correct is higher, the difference is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV, option B.

But wait, why is the relativistic T1 higher? Because in relativity, the kinetic energy is higher than the non-relativistic value when you have significant mass changes, perhaps. Because the mass of the fragment is a significant fraction, so relativistic effects matter. Hmm, not entirely sure, but the numbers add up.

To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approximations. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. This means 3 GeV of energy is converted into kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Fragment Masses
The two fragments have rest masses \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) (more massive) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) (less massive). The total rest mass energy is \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving 3 GeV for kinetic energy.

### Step 2: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation
In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy is distributed between the two fragments. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Using conservation of momentum and the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (\( T_{1,\text{class}} \)) is calculated as:

\[
T_{1,\text{class}} = \frac{3 \, \text{GeV}}{3} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Let \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) be the total energies of the more and less massive fragments, respectively. Using energy conservation:

\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_1^2 = p^2 + m_1^2, \quad E_2^2 = p^2 + m_2^2,
\]

where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment (equal in magnitude but opposite in direction due to conservation of momentum). Substituting \( E_2 = 300 - E_1 \) into the equations and solving for \( E_1 \), we find:

\[
E_1 \approx 199.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:

\[
T_{1,\text{rel}} = E_1 - m_1 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV} - 198 \, \text{GeV} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Calculations
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = T_{1,\text{rel}} - T_{1,\text{class}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the nucleus splits into two or more parts. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the difference between the relativistic and classical calculations.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and is at rest. Then it spontaneously fissions into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So that means the total mass after fission is 0.99 M. 

Wait, wait. So the initial rest mass is M, but after fission, the combined rest mass is 0.99 M. That means some mass has been converted into energy, like kinetic energy or other forms. So the mass defect would be 1% of M, but wait, 300 GeV is the rest mass energy. So initial energy is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV. That's the total energy available for kinetic energy and other things like binding energy, but the problem ignores electrons, so maybe not much to worry about other than kinetic.

So the two fragments: their masses are in a ratio of 2:1. Let me say the smaller mass is m, so the larger is 2m. The sum is 3m. And 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3. Wait, but M is the initial mass, which is the rest mass before fission. So M = 300 GeV / c², but maybe c=1 in these units. So m = 0.33 M. No, wait, 3m =0.99 M → m=0.33 M? No, wait, 3m=0.99 M → m=0.33 M? Wait, no:

Wait, 3m =0.99 M → m= (0.99 /3) M → m ≈ 0.33 M. So m is roughly a third of M? Or wait, M is 300 GeV/c², so 0.99 M is 297 GeV/c². So each fragment's rest mass is 99 GeV/c² and 198 GeV/c². Because 2m + m =3m=297 GeV/c². So the smaller fragment is 99 GeV/c², the larger is 198 GeV/c². So their rest masses add up correctly.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then compare the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations of T1.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So I have to compute T1 rel and T1 class, subtract them, and find which option it is.

So, first, let's model the problem.

Total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E1 = (m1 c²) + K1, E2 = (m2 c²) + K2.

But since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite. So p1 = -p2.

In relativity, the energy of a fragment is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, for fragment 1 (mass m1=198 GeV/c², assuming c=1), E1² = p^2 + (198)^2.

Fragment 2 (m2=99 GeV/c²), E2² = p^2 + (99)^2.

But wait, the momentum magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite. So p1 = p, p2 = -p. But the energies are E1 and E2.

Also, the sum of the energies E1 + E2 must equal the initial energy, which was 300 GeV. Because energy is conserved.

So:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1² = p² + (198)^2,

E2² = p² + (99)^2.

We can write E1 = sqrt(p² + 198²),

E2 = sqrt(p² + 99²).

So,

sqrt(p² + 198²) + sqrt(p² + 99²) = 300.

We need to solve for p.

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. Perhaps we can square both sides.

Let me denote A = sqrt(p^2 +198^2), B= sqrt(p^2 +99^2).

So A + B =300.

Square both sides:

(A + B)^2 = 300^2 → A² + 2AB + B² =90000.

But A² = p^2 + 198²,

B² = p^2 + 99².

So,

(p² + 198²) + 2AB + (p² +99²) = 90000.

Combine terms:

2 p² + (198² +99²) + 2AB =90000.

Let's compute 198² and 99²:

198^2 = (200-2)^2= 40000 - 800 +4=39204.

99^2=9801.

So sum is 39204 +9801=49005.

So,

2 p² + 49005 + 2AB =90000.

So,

2 p² +2AB = 90000 -49005=40995.

Divide both sides by 2:

p² + AB = 20497.5.

Hmm. Now, what's AB?

AB = sqrt( (p^2 +198²)(p^2 +99²) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me call p^2 = x.

So,

x + AB = 20497.5.

But AB = sqrt( (x + 198²)(x +99²) )

This seems complicated. Maybe we can find another equation.

Alternatively, let's subtract the energies:

E1 - E2 = (sqrt(x +198²) - sqrt(x +99²)).

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to make an approximation. Wait, but the problem says to find the difference between relativistic and classical calculations. So perhaps the non-relativistic approach would give a different T1, and the relativistic approach gives a different value, and the difference is one of the options.

Wait, but let's think about the classical approach first. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

In that approximation, the total kinetic energy plus rest mass would be the initial energy.

Wait, no, the non-relativistic case assumes that the mass doesn't change. Wait, no, the rest mass changes, but in the non-relativistic approach, perhaps they ignore the mass change, but the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps the non-relativistic calculation would assume that the masses are the same as the rest masses, but that the kinetic energy is from the mass change.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, in classical physics, momentum is conserved, and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2 for each fragment.

Let me think about the non-relativistic approach.

In non-relativistic, the total momentum after fission is zero, so each fragment has momentum p and -p. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude.

But in non-relativistic, p = m v.

So for fragment 1: p = m1 v1.

Fragment 2: p = m2 v2.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, v1 = -v2.

Wait, no, because the momenta must be opposite, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Wait, but in non-relativistic, the velocities would be v1 and v2, and p1 = m1 v1, p2= m2 v2.

Conservation of momentum: m1 v1 + m2 v2 =0 → m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

So, v2 = -(m1/m2) v1.

But since m1=2m2 (because m1 is twice as massive as m2), then v2= -(2m2/m2) v1 → v2= -2 v1.

So fragment 1 has velocity v, fragment 2 has velocity -2v.

Then, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is (1/2) m1 v^2.

Fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m2 (2v)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v² = 2 m2 v².

So total KE (non-relativistic) would be:

(1/2) m1 v² + 2 m2 v².

But m1=2 m2, so substituting:

(1/2)(2 m2) v² + 2 m2 v² = m2 v² + 2 m2 v² = 3 m2 v².

Now, the total energy is the initial energy, which is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. But in non-relativistic, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies (assuming no mass change) plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but after fission, the rest energies are m1 c² and m2 c². Since the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 *300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV.

So in non-relativistic, the rest energy is 297 GeV, and the kinetic energy is 3 m2 v².

So the total energy is 297 + 3 m2 v² =300 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v² =3 GeV.

Thus,

m2 v²= 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². Wait, but in non-relativistic, the mass is constant. Hmm, but units are a bit tricky since we're mixing GeV and c=1 units.

Wait, perhaps I should set c=1 for simplicity, so that E=mc² is E= m * c² → E= m when c=1, but units are in GeV.

So, m2 is 99 GeV/c², but if c=1, then E= m in units where c=1. So E2_rest = m2 =99 GeV.

So, in non-relativistic:

Total KE =3 m2 v² =3 GeV.

So,

3 * (99 GeV) * v² = 3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, m2 is 99 GeV/c². But with c=1, m2 is 99 GeV.

So,

3 * m2 * v² =3 GeV → 3 *99 GeV *v² =3 GeV → 99 v² =3 /3 → v²= (1 GeV)/(99 GeV) → v²=1/99 → v= 1/sqrt(99) ≈0.1 c.

So the velocity is about 0.1c, which is non-relativistic.

So the KE of fragment 1, which is the more massive one, is (1/2) m1 v².

m1=198 GeV.

So,

KE1 = 0.5 *198 GeV * (1/99) → 0.5 * 198 /99 → 0.5 * 2 =1 GeV.

So T1_classical =1 GeV =1000 MeV.

Wait, that's 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are in MeV, and the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. Hmm, that suggests I'm missing something. Because according to this, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are nowhere near that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the calculation is different. Let me think again.

Wait, in the non-relativistic approach, the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect of 3 GeV. So the total KE is 3 GeV, split between the two fragments in a way that depends on their masses.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives T1_classical as 1 GeV. But the options are in MeV, so maybe I messed up the units? Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial mass is 300 GeV. The sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. So the total KE is 3 GeV.

But according to the earlier calculation, in non-relativistic, the more massive fragment has 1 GeV KE, and the lighter has 2 GeV KE. But that adds up to 3 GeV, so that's correct.

But the problem is about the difference between the relativistic and the classical T1. So I need to find T1_rel and T1_class, then compute T1_rel - T1_class, or vice versa.

Wait, but the relativistic approach is going to give a different T1. Because in reality, the kinetic energy is not just (1/2)mv². So I need to calculate the relativistic T1.

So, let's go back to the relativistic approach.

We have E1 + E2=300 GeV.

E1² = p² + m1² → (E1)^2 = p² + (198)^2.

E2² = p² + (99)^2.

And E1 + E2=300.

We can write E2=300 - E1.

So,

(300 - E1)^2 = p² + (99)^2.

But,

E1² = p² + 198².

Subtracting the two equations,

(300 - E1)^2 - E1² = (99)^2 - (198)^2.

Expand (300-E1)^2:

= 90000 - 600 E1 + E1^2 - E1^2 = 90000 -600 E1.

So,

90000 -600 E1 = (99)^2 - (198)^2.

Compute RHS:

99²=9801, 198²=39204.

So,

9801 -39204= -29403.

So,

90000 -600 E1 = -29403.

→ 90000 +29403 =600 E1.

→ 119403=600 E1.

→ E1=119403 /600 ≈199.005 GeV.

So E1≈199.005 GeV.

E2=300-199.005=100.995 GeV.

Now, E1² =p² +198^2 → (199.005)^2 = p² + 39204.

199.005^2 ≈ (200 -0.995)^2 = 40000 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2 ≈40000 - 398 +1 → approx 39603.

Wait, but more accurately, 199.005 *199.005:

= (200 -0.995)^2 = 200^2 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2.

=40000 - 398 + 0.990025.

=40000 -398=39602; 39602 +0.990025≈39602.99.

So,

39602.99 ≈ p² +39204 → p²=39602.99-39204=398.99 ≈399 GeV².

So p≈sqrt(399) ≈19.975 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is E1 - m1 =199.005 -198=1.005 GeV.

So T1_rel≈1.005 GeV.

In the classical approach, T1_class is 1 GeV.

So the difference is 1.005 GeV -1 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is about 1.005 GeV, and the classical T1 is 1 GeV. So the difference is 5 MeV. So the correct T1 is higher by approximately 5 MeV.

Wait, but the problem says, "the difference between the correct T1 value and T1 value calculated using classical approximation." So correct is higher, the difference is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV, option B.

But wait, why is the relativistic T1 higher? Because in relativity, the kinetic energy is higher than the non-relativistic value when you have significant mass changes, perhaps. Because the mass of the fragment is a significant fraction, so relativistic effects matter. Hmm, not entirely sure, but the numbers add up.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approximations. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. This means 3 GeV of energy is converted into kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Fragment Masses
The two fragments have rest masses \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) (more massive) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) (less massive). The total rest mass energy is \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving 3 GeV for kinetic energy.

### Step 2: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation
In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy is distributed between the two fragments. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Using conservation of momentum and the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (\( T_{1,\text{class}} \)) is calculated as:

\[
T_{1,\text{class}} = \frac{3 \, \text{GeV}}{3} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Let \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) be the total energies of the more and less massive fragments, respectively. Using energy conservation:

\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_1^2 = p^2 + m_1^2, \quad E_2^2 = p^2 + m_2^2,
\]

where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment (equal in magnitude but opposite in direction due to conservation of momentum). Substituting \( E_2 = 300 - E_1 \) into the equations and solving for \( E_1 \), we find:

\[
E_1 \approx 199.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:

\[
T_{1,\text{rel}} = E_1 - m_1 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV} - 198 \, \text{GeV} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Calculations
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = T_{1,\text{rel}} - T_{1,\text{class}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
