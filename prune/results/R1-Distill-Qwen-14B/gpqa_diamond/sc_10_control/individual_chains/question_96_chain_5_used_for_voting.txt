Okay, so I've got this problem about a supermassive black hole and finding its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object, which would be the event horizon in this case.

Wait, the formula for angular size is probably something like θ = (size) / distance. Oh right, but in radians. Oh wait, because θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first. Because the formula θ ≈ size/distance only works when θ is in radians and the distance is much larger than the size, so we can ignore the curvature of the light path or something like that.

So, θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let's see, π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then the size of the event horizon, which I think is the Schwarzschild radius, R = 2GM/c². But wait, in this case, the size would be the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / (c²), and the angular size is θ = R_s / d. So R_s = θ_rad * d.

Wait, but d is in parsecs. I should convert that to meters to be consistent with the units for R_s. One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R_s = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let's compute that.

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Hmm, 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37. So R_s ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters, which is 5.37e4 kilometers. That seems a bit big, but supermassive black holes can be millions to billions of solar masses. Wait, the Schwarzschild radius for the sun is about 3 km, so for a million solar masses, R_s would be 3e6 km, which is about 3e9 meters. Oh wait, 5.37e7 meters is 53,700 km, which is like 5e4 km, that would correspond to about 1e5 solar masses? Because R_s scales linearly with mass.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. So once I have R_s, I can find M, the mass of the black hole. Because R_s = 2 G M / c². So M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G).

But perhaps another approach is to find the entropy, which is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, A is the area, which is π R_s^2. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) = (k c^3 (π R_s² )) / (4 ħ G).

Alternatively, since the formula is S = (k A c^3) / (4 ħ G), but maybe I should plug in A as π R_s^2.

Wait, let me write down the formula correctly. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * k, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G). But wait, I think that's right. So I need to compute A, the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R_s.

So A = 4 π R_s². Wait, no, wait. No, the event horizon is a sphere, so area is 4 pi R_s^2. So, yeah, maybe I should use that.

Alternatively, sometimes people write the entropy as S = (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) * (A), but I have to make sure about the constants.

But perhaps an easier approach is to express the entropy in terms of the mass, because I can find the mass from R_s and then plug into the entropy formula.

Wait, another way: since R_s is 2 G M / c², so M = (R_s c² )/(2 G). So M = (R_s c^2 )/(2 G).

Once I have M, I can find the entropy. Alternatively, the entropy can be written in terms of M. Let me see: substituting M into the entropy formula.

Wait, the entropy formula in terms of M is S = (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) * (4 pi (R_s)^2) ) = (k c^3) * 4 pi ( (2 G M / c² )^2 ) ) / (4 ħ G )

Simplify this:

S = (k c^3 * 4 pi * (4 G² M² ) / c^4 ) / (4 ħ G )

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 4 pi * (4 G² M² / c^4) = 16 pi G² M² / c^4.

So S = [k c^3 * 16 pi G² M² / c^4 ] / (4 ħ G )

Simplify denominator: 4 ħ G.

So numerator: 16 pi G² M² k c^3 / c^4 = (16 pi G² M² k ) / c.

Denominator: 4 ħ G.

So S = (16 pi G² M² k ) / (4 ħ G c ) ) = (4 pi G M² k )/( ħ c )

Hmm, not sure if this is the most straightforward path. Maybe I should compute R_s first, then compute A, then plug into S.

So getting back: R_s ≈ 5.37e7 meters. So A = 4 pi R_s^2 = 4 pi (5.37e7 m)^2.

Compute that: (5.37e7)^2 = 2.88e15 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566e15 * 2.88e15? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5.37e7 squared is (5.37)^2 = ~28.8, and 1e14 because (e7)^2 is e14. So 28.8e14 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.14 ~12.56, so 12.56 *28.8e14 = ~362.8e14 m², which is 3.628e16 m².

Wait, wait, double-checking:

R_s = 5.37e7 meters.

R_s squared = (5.37e7)^2 = (5.37)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 28.8369 * 1e14 = 2.88369e15 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.5664.

So A = 12.5664 * 2.88369e15 = let's compute 12.5664 * 2.88369.

12.5664 * 2.88369 ≈ approximately 36.29.

So 36.29e15 m² = 3.629e16 m².

Ok, so area A is about 3.63e16 m².

Now, plug into entropy formula: S = (k c^3 A ) / (4 ħ G )

Let me get the constants straight.

k (Boltzmann) is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2 pi, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is gravitational constant, 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So let's compute each part.

Compute numerator: k c^3 A.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A = 3.63e16 m².

So numerator = (1.38e-23) * (2.7e25) * (3.63e16 )

Compute 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) * 1e2 = 3.726 * 1e2 = 372.6.

Then multiply by 3.63e16: 372.6 * 3.63e16 = approx 1.353e2 * 1e16 = 1.353e18? Wait, wait, 372.6 *3.63 is let's compute that.

372.6 *3.63.

372.6 *3 = 1117.8.

372.6 *0.63 ≈ 234.258.

Sum is about 1352.058. So 1352.058e (16) => 1.352e19? Because 1352e16 is 1.352e19.

Wait, 372.6 is 3.726e2, 3.63e16 is 3.63e16.

So 3.726e2 *3.63e16 = (3.726 *3.63 )e(2+16) = approx 13.52e18 = 1.352e19.

So numerator is ~1.352e19 J·m²/s³·K.

Wait, but wait, the units may not be precise, but perhaps we can proceed with the calculation.

Denominator: 4 ħ G.

4 * ħ =4 *1.0545718e-34 ≈4.218e-34 J s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So denominator = (4.218e-34) * (6.6743e-11 ) = (4.218 *6.6743 )e-45.

Compute 4.218 *6.6743:

4 *6.6743 =26.6972.

0.218 *6.6743≈ approx 1.455.

So total approx 28.1522.

So denominator is 28.1522e-45 = 2.81522e-44.

So S = numerator / denominator = (1.352e19 ) / (2.81522e-44 ) J/K.

Wait, 1.352e19 / 2.81522e-44 = (1.352 /2.81522 )e(19 +44) )

1.352 /2.81522 ≈ approx 0.48.

So 0.48e63 = 4.8e62 J/K.

Wait, but the options are around 1e59, 1e62, etc. So this is about 1e62 J/K. So the order of magnitude is 1e62, so the answer would be option A) 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but let me double-check the computations because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Let me go through the steps again.

Compute R_s: 

θ_deg =1e-17 degrees --> θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 * 3.086e16 meters =3.086e26 meters.

R_s = θ_rad * d =1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) *1e7.

1.745 *3.086 ≈5.37, so R_s ≈5.37e7 meters.

Then A =4 pi R_s^2 =4 *3.1416*(5.37e7)^2.

(5.37e7)^2 =2.88e15 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 ≈12.566, 12.566 *2.88e15 = approx 3.628e16 m².

Then the entropy formula: S=(k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G).

Compute numerator: k*c^3*A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *3.628e16.

Compute (3e8)^3 =27e24 =2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7 )e( -23+25 )=3.726e2.

Multiply by 3.628e16: 3.726e2 *3.628e16 =1.352e19.

Denominator:4 ħ G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

4*1.05457e-34=4.218e-34.

4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743)e-45≈28.15e-45=2.815e-44.

So S=1.352e19 /2.815e-44 = (1.352/2.815) *1e63 ≈0.48 *1e63=4.8e62.

Which is ~1e62, so the order is 1e62. So answer is option A.

To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we start by calculating the Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) using the angular size formula. The angular size in radians is given by:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}.
\]

Substituting \(\theta_{\text{deg}} = 10^{-17}\):

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance to the galaxy is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), and converting parsecs to meters (\( 1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The Schwarzschild radius is then:

\[
R_s = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{26} \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2.
\]

Substituting \( R_s = 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m} \):

\[
R_s^2 = (5.37 \times 10^7)^2 = 2.88 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi \cdot 2.88 \times 10^{15} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

The entropy of the black hole is calculated using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G},
\]

where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \).

First, compute the numerator \( k c^3 A \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3,
\]

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (3.63 \times 10^{16}).
\]

\[
k c^3 A \approx 1.352 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, compute the denominator \( 4 \hbar G \):

\[
4 \hbar = 4 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} = 4.218 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s},
\]

\[
4 \hbar G = (4.218 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.815 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, calculate the entropy:

\[
S = \frac{1.352 \times 10^{19}}{2.815 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

The order of magnitude of the entropy is \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this problem about a supermassive black hole and finding its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object, which would be the event horizon in this case.

Wait, the formula for angular size is probably something like θ = (size) / distance. Oh right, but in radians. Oh wait, because θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first. Because the formula θ ≈ size/distance only works when θ is in radians and the distance is much larger than the size, so we can ignore the curvature of the light path or something like that.

So, θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let's see, π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then the size of the event horizon, which I think is the Schwarzschild radius, R = 2GM/c². But wait, in this case, the size would be the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / (c²), and the angular size is θ = R_s / d. So R_s = θ_rad * d.

Wait, but d is in parsecs. I should convert that to meters to be consistent with the units for R_s. One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R_s = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let's compute that.

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Hmm, 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37. So R_s ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters, which is 5.37e4 kilometers. That seems a bit big, but supermassive black holes can be millions to billions of solar masses. Wait, the Schwarzschild radius for the sun is about 3 km, so for a million solar masses, R_s would be 3e6 km, which is about 3e9 meters. Oh wait, 5.37e7 meters is 53,700 km, which is like 5e4 km, that would correspond to about 1e5 solar masses? Because R_s scales linearly with mass.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. So once I have R_s, I can find M, the mass of the black hole. Because R_s = 2 G M / c². So M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G).

But perhaps another approach is to find the entropy, which is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, A is the area, which is π R_s^2. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) = (k c^3 (π R_s² )) / (4 ħ G).

Alternatively, since the formula is S = (k A c^3) / (4 ħ G), but maybe I should plug in A as π R_s^2.

Wait, let me write down the formula correctly. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * k, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G). But wait, I think that's right. So I need to compute A, the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R_s.

So A = 4 π R_s². Wait, no, wait. No, the event horizon is a sphere, so area is 4 pi R_s^2. So, yeah, maybe I should use that.

Alternatively, sometimes people write the entropy as S = (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) * (A), but I have to make sure about the constants.

But perhaps an easier approach is to express the entropy in terms of the mass, because I can find the mass from R_s and then plug into the entropy formula.

Wait, another way: since R_s is 2 G M / c², so M = (R_s c² )/(2 G). So M = (R_s c^2 )/(2 G).

Once I have M, I can find the entropy. Alternatively, the entropy can be written in terms of M. Let me see: substituting M into the entropy formula.

Wait, the entropy formula in terms of M is S = (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) * (4 pi (R_s)^2) ) = (k c^3) * 4 pi ( (2 G M / c² )^2 ) ) / (4 ħ G )

Simplify this:

S = (k c^3 * 4 pi * (4 G² M² ) / c^4 ) / (4 ħ G )

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 4 pi * (4 G² M² / c^4) = 16 pi G² M² / c^4.

So S = [k c^3 * 16 pi G² M² / c^4 ] / (4 ħ G )

Simplify denominator: 4 ħ G.

So numerator: 16 pi G² M² k c^3 / c^4 = (16 pi G² M² k ) / c.

Denominator: 4 ħ G.

So S = (16 pi G² M² k ) / (4 ħ G c ) ) = (4 pi G M² k )/( ħ c )

Hmm, not sure if this is the most straightforward path. Maybe I should compute R_s first, then compute A, then plug into S.

So getting back: R_s ≈ 5.37e7 meters. So A = 4 pi R_s^2 = 4 pi (5.37e7 m)^2.

Compute that: (5.37e7)^2 = 2.88e15 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566e15 * 2.88e15? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5.37e7 squared is (5.37)^2 = ~28.8, and 1e14 because (e7)^2 is e14. So 28.8e14 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.14 ~12.56, so 12.56 *28.8e14 = ~362.8e14 m², which is 3.628e16 m².

Wait, wait, double-checking:

R_s = 5.37e7 meters.

R_s squared = (5.37e7)^2 = (5.37)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 28.8369 * 1e14 = 2.88369e15 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.5664.

So A = 12.5664 * 2.88369e15 = let's compute 12.5664 * 2.88369.

12.5664 * 2.88369 ≈ approximately 36.29.

So 36.29e15 m² = 3.629e16 m².

Ok, so area A is about 3.63e16 m².

Now, plug into entropy formula: S = (k c^3 A ) / (4 ħ G )

Let me get the constants straight.

k (Boltzmann) is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2 pi, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is gravitational constant, 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So let's compute each part.

Compute numerator: k c^3 A.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

A = 3.63e16 m².

So numerator = (1.38e-23) * (2.7e25) * (3.63e16 )

Compute 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) * 1e2 = 3.726 * 1e2 = 372.6.

Then multiply by 3.63e16: 372.6 * 3.63e16 = approx 1.353e2 * 1e16 = 1.353e18? Wait, wait, 372.6 *3.63 is let's compute that.

372.6 *3.63.

372.6 *3 = 1117.8.

372.6 *0.63 ≈ 234.258.

Sum is about 1352.058. So 1352.058e (16) => 1.352e19? Because 1352e16 is 1.352e19.

Wait, 372.6 is 3.726e2, 3.63e16 is 3.63e16.

So 3.726e2 *3.63e16 = (3.726 *3.63 )e(2+16) = approx 13.52e18 = 1.352e19.

So numerator is ~1.352e19 J·m²/s³·K.

Wait, but wait, the units may not be precise, but perhaps we can proceed with the calculation.

Denominator: 4 ħ G.

4 * ħ =4 *1.0545718e-34 ≈4.218e-34 J s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So denominator = (4.218e-34) * (6.6743e-11 ) = (4.218 *6.6743 )e-45.

Compute 4.218 *6.6743:

4 *6.6743 =26.6972.

0.218 *6.6743≈ approx 1.455.

So total approx 28.1522.

So denominator is 28.1522e-45 = 2.81522e-44.

So S = numerator / denominator = (1.352e19 ) / (2.81522e-44 ) J/K.

Wait, 1.352e19 / 2.81522e-44 = (1.352 /2.81522 )e(19 +44) )

1.352 /2.81522 ≈ approx 0.48.

So 0.48e63 = 4.8e62 J/K.

Wait, but the options are around 1e59, 1e62, etc. So this is about 1e62 J/K. So the order of magnitude is 1e62, so the answer would be option A) 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but let me double-check the computations because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Let me go through the steps again.

Compute R_s: 

θ_deg =1e-17 degrees --> θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 * 3.086e16 meters =3.086e26 meters.

R_s = θ_rad * d =1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) *1e7.

1.745 *3.086 ≈5.37, so R_s ≈5.37e7 meters.

Then A =4 pi R_s^2 =4 *3.1416*(5.37e7)^2.

(5.37e7)^2 =2.88e15 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 ≈12.566, 12.566 *2.88e15 = approx 3.628e16 m².

Then the entropy formula: S=(k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G).

Compute numerator: k*c^3*A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 *3.628e16.

Compute (3e8)^3 =27e24 =2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 *2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7 )e( -23+25 )=3.726e2.

Multiply by 3.628e16: 3.726e2 *3.628e16 =1.352e19.

Denominator:4 ħ G =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

4*1.05457e-34=4.218e-34.

4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743)e-45≈28.15e-45=2.815e-44.

So S=1.352e19 /2.815e-44 = (1.352/2.815) *1e63 ≈0.48 *1e63=4.8e62.

Which is ~1e62, so the order is 1e62. So answer is option A.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we start by calculating the Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) using the angular size formula. The angular size in radians is given by:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}.
\]

Substituting \(\theta_{\text{deg}} = 10^{-17}\):

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance to the galaxy is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), and converting parsecs to meters (\( 1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The Schwarzschild radius is then:

\[
R_s = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{26} \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2.
\]

Substituting \( R_s = 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m} \):

\[
R_s^2 = (5.37 \times 10^7)^2 = 2.88 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi \cdot 2.88 \times 10^{15} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

The entropy of the black hole is calculated using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G},
\]

where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \).

First, compute the numerator \( k c^3 A \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3,
\]

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (3.63 \times 10^{16}).
\]

\[
k c^3 A \approx 1.352 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, compute the denominator \( 4 \hbar G \):

\[
4 \hbar = 4 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} = 4.218 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s},
\]

\[
4 \hbar G = (4.218 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.815 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, calculate the entropy:

\[
S = \frac{1.352 \times 10^{19}}{2.815 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

The order of magnitude of the entropy is \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, the correct answer is:
