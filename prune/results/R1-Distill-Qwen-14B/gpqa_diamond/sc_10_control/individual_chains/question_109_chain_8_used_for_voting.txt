Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission, and I'm supposed to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

Alright, the system is two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the final NN state's isospin (T), angular momentum (S), and spin satisfy T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Wait, no, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum? Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms here.

Wait, the problem says, "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum, I think. Because angular momentum usually refers to the total, but in this case, maybe S is spin and L is orbital.

So the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So we can plug that into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L + 1 must be even. Because 0 mod 2 is 0. So S + L + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. One is even, the other odd.

Next, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are various transitions from the initial 1S0 state to some other state plus a particle X (denoted by the letter p, s, f, etc. which are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers).

Wait, the options are labeled as 1S0 -> something, which is the initial state. The something is a state plus a lowercase letter. So for example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So I think the 'p' refers to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. Because in particle physics, p usually denotes a photon, but wait, X is a particle emitted, and its intrinsic parity is given as -1. So perhaps the 'p' in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle X. Because p is associated with l=1 (since p orbital is l=1).

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has S=0 (since it's 1S0, which is (2S+1)=1 → S=0). And L=0 because it's S state, which is L=0.

So the initial state has J=0 because J = S + L, and both are 0. So the initial state has total angular momentum J=0.

When they emit a particle X, which has its own spin, but I think mainly, we're concerned with the orbital angular momentum part. Because the emitted particle's spin might affect things, but perhaps the problem is mainly about parity and angular momentum conservation.

But wait, the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity conservation.

The parity of the initial state: it's 1S0. The parity P for a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Since it's S state, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

Now the final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X. But I think the process is that the two nucleons (NN) go into a new state, and emit X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.

But wait, the question is about the allowed partial waves. Partial waves are characterized by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle. So for each option, the emitted X has a certain l.

So parity of the final state (NN + X) must equal initial parity. But the initial parity is 1.

Wait, but the parity of the final state would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. Because when you have two objects, their combined parity is the product of their individual parities. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the system is the NN pair and X. The process is NN (initial) → NN (final) + X. So the parity of the entire system (NN_initial) is the same as (NN_final) × X_parity × (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission of X.

Wait, no. When a particle X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and X is l. So the orbital part contributes (-1)^l to the parity. So the total parity should be the initial parity, which is 1.

So the equation for parity conservation is:

P_initial = P_final × (-1)^l × P_X.

Wait, P_initial is 1 because the initial state is 1S0 with L=0 → parity 1.

P_final is the parity of the NN_final state, which would be (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the new NN state.

P_X is the intrinsic parity of X, which is given as -1.

So the equation is:

1 = [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1)^l ] * (-1)

Wait, because the emitted particle has parity P_X = -1.

Wait, let me think. The initial state parity is P_initial = 1. The final state is the product of the parity of the NN_final state (P_NN_final = (-1)^{L'} ), the parity of X (P_X = -1), and the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X, which is l. So the orbital part contributes (-1)^l.

So, the parity equation becomes:

P_initial = P_NN_final × P_X × (-1)^l.

So,

1 = (-1)^{L'} × (-1) × (-1)^l.

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

Because (-1)^{L'} × (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1}, and then multiplied by (-1)^l gives (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

So the equation becomes:

1 = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

Which implies that:

(-1)^{L' + l + 1} = 1.

Which means that L' + l + 1 must be even.

So L' + l + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which implies L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So L' and l must be of opposite parity. One is even, the other odd.

Now, the other condition we have is from Pauli statistics: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

But the final NN state has T=0. So,

0 = S + L' + 1 mod 2.

Which implies S + L' ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L' must be of opposite parity.

So let's recap the conditions:

1. S + L' ≡ 1 mod 2 → S and L' have opposite parity.

2. L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2 → L' and l have opposite parity.

So combining these, S and L' are opposite (from condition 1), and L' and l are opposite (condition 2). Therefore, S and l must be the same parity.

So S ≡ l mod 2.

Because if L' is opposite to S, and L' is opposite to l, then S must be same as l.

So S and l must have the same parity.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. The initial state has S = 0 (from 1S0, (2S+1)=1 → S=0). The initial angular momentum J is 0 (since L=0 and S=0, so J=0).

When the particle X is emitted, the process is:

Initial state: NN (1S0, J=0) → NN (some state) + X.

The total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0.

The final state's angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's angular momentum (J_final) and the X's angular momentum (j_X). But wait, angular momentum is additive. So for the total angular momentum to be conserved, the initial J_initial must equal the total J_final, which is the vector sum of the NN's J and X's j.

But since X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l between NN and X contributes to the angular momentum. So the total is J_NN' (the NN's total angular momentum) plus j_X (the spin of X) plus l (the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is a vector). But wait, perhaps it's more correct to think in terms of the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X system.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is l, and the spin of X is s. But in this problem, since the X is a boson or fermion, but perhaps it's more about the orbital part.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the reaction.

The initial state is NN in 1S0, which is a state with L=0 (S state) and S=0 (singlet spin). So the initial total angular momentum J is 0.

In the final state, the NN system has some state with certain L' and S'. The X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l and spin s. So the total angular momentum is the sum of J_NN' and j_X, but in terms of quantum numbers, we have to consider that the orbital angular momentum l is part of the system. So the total angular momentum must be J_initial = 0.

Hmm, but perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum l (from the emission of X) must be such that when added to the NN's angular momentum, the total is conserved.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think that the orbital angular momentum l is part of the process, and the total angular momentum is conserved as the sum of the NN's angular momentum J_NN' and the X's angular momentum (which includes its spin and orbital parts).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach each option one by one, considering the conditions we have.

So, the conditions we have are:

1. For the parity: L' + l must be odd (from above).

2. For Pauli's condition: S' + L' must be odd.

3. Additionally, since the initial J is 0, the sum of the final J_NN' and X's angular momentum must be 0. But J_NN' is sqrt( (S'(S'+1) + L'(L'+1) + ... ) ), but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can consider that the orbital angular momentum l and the spin of X affect the allowed transitions. But maybe the main focus is on the quantum numbers' parities.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only about the orbital angular momentum's parity and the conditions, so maybe we can proceed without considering the spin of X.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the allowed combinations based on the conditions we have.

Let me list the conditions again:

- L' + l must be odd (from parity conservation).

- S' + L' must be odd (from Pauli's condition).

So combining these, S' and l must have the same parity. Because, since L' must be opposite to both S' and l, and S' and l are connected via L', they must have the same parity.

So each option gives a specific transition, and I need to check whether these conditions hold.

Wait, each option shows the initial state (1S0) → a new state (like 7D1) plus a particle (like p), where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. I think the letters correspond to the orbital angular momentum l of X. Because:

- s → l=0,

- p → l=1,

- d → l=2,

- f → l=3, etc.

So for each option, I can determine l and the final NN state's L' and S'.

Wait, the final NN state in each option is given as, e.g., 7D1. So the term is (2S'+1) L' J.

For example, 7D1:

- (2S' +1) =7 → S'=3,

- L' is D → L'=2,

- J=1.

So the final state's S' is 3, L'=2.

Wait, so for each option, the final NN state's S' and L' can be determined.

Then, we can check the conditions:

1. Pauli condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → 0 = (S' + L' +1) mod 2.

So S' + L' +1 must be even → S' + L' must be odd.

2. Parity condition: L' + l must be odd.

So let's go through each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the emitted X has l=p → l=1.

The final NN state is 7D1 → (2S'+1)=7 → S'=3; L'=D=2.

So S' =3, L'=2.

Check Pauli condition: S' + L' mod 2 = 3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2=1. So 3+2=5 → 5+1=6 mod2=0. So T=0, which matches the given.

So condition 1 is satisfied.

Now, check parity condition: L' + l must be 2 +1=3, which is odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

So both conditions hold. So Option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

X is p → l=1.

Final NN state is 3S1.

So (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=S → L'=0.

So S'=1, L'=0.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =1+0=1 → 1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0, which is correct.

Parity condition: L'=0, l=1. 0+1=1 → odd. So condition 2 holds.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 → 3D3 + f.

X is f → l=3.

Final state is 3D3.

(2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=D=2.

So S'=1, L'=2.

Pauli condition: 1+2=3 → 3 +1=4 mod2=0 → T=0. So condition 1 holds.

Parity condition: L'=2, l=3. 2+3=5 → odd. So condition 2 holds.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

X is s → l=0.

Final state is 3P0.

(2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=P=1.

So S'=1, L'=1.

Pauli condition: 1 +1 =2 → 2+1=3 mod2=1. So 1+1+1=3 mod2=1. So T would be 1, but the problem states T=0. So this condition is not satisfied. Therefore, option D violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The Pauli condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, T is given as 0. So S + L +1 must be even → S + L must be odd.

In option D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → even. So 2 +1=3. 3 mod 2 is 1. So T would be 1, but the final T is 0. So this condition is violated. Therefore, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but let me double-check the conditions. For option D:

S'=1, L'=1.

So S + L +1 mod 2 → 1+1+1=3 → 3 mod2=1. So T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So this transition is not permitted.

So the forbidden one is option D.

To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state, the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum satisfy:
   \[
   T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \(T(NN) = 0\), this implies:
   \[
   S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Thus, \(S(NN)\) and \(L(NN)\) must have opposite parity.

2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state (1S0) has parity \(P_{\text{initial}} = 1\). The parity of the final state is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l,
   \]
   where \(P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L(NN)}\), \(P_X = -1\) (intrinsic parity of the emitted particle), and \(l\) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Since \(P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}}\), we have:
   \[
   1 = (-1)^{L(NN)} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^l \quad \Rightarrow \quad (-1)^{L(NN) + l + 1} = 1.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   L(NN) + l + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad L(NN) + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Thus, \(L(NN)\) and \(l\) must have opposite parity.

3. **Combining Conditions**: From the Pauli condition, \(S(NN)\) and \(L(NN)\) have opposite parity. From the parity conservation condition, \(L(NN)\) and \(l\) have opposite parity. Therefore, \(S(NN)\) and \(l\) must have the same parity.

Now, we analyze each option:

### Option A: \(1S0 \to 7D1 + p\)
- Final NN state: \(7D1\), so \(S(NN) = 3\) (from \(2S+1 = 7\)) and \(L(NN) = 2\) (from \(D\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 1\) (from \(p\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option B: \(1S0 \to 3S1 + p\)
- Final NN state: \(3S1\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 0\) (from \(S\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 1\) (from \(p\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option C: \(1S0 \to 3D3 + f\)
- Final NN state: \(3D3\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 2\) (from \(D\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 3\) (from \(f\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option D: \(1S0 \to 3P0 + s\)
- Final NN state: \(3P0\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 1\) (from \(P\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition **not satisfied**.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 0\) (from \(s\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Since the Pauli condition is violated, this transition is **not allowed**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission, and I'm supposed to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

Alright, the system is two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the final NN state's isospin (T), angular momentum (S), and spin satisfy T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Wait, no, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum? Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms here.

Wait, the problem says, "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum, I think. Because angular momentum usually refers to the total, but in this case, maybe S is spin and L is orbital.

So the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So we can plug that into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L + 1 must be even. Because 0 mod 2 is 0. So S + L + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. One is even, the other odd.

Next, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are various transitions from the initial 1S0 state to some other state plus a particle X (denoted by the letter p, s, f, etc. which are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers).

Wait, the options are labeled as 1S0 -> something, which is the initial state. The something is a state plus a lowercase letter. So for example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So I think the 'p' refers to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. Because in particle physics, p usually denotes a photon, but wait, X is a particle emitted, and its intrinsic parity is given as -1. So perhaps the 'p' in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle X. Because p is associated with l=1 (since p orbital is l=1).

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has S=0 (since it's 1S0, which is (2S+1)=1 → S=0). And L=0 because it's S state, which is L=0.

So the initial state has J=0 because J = S + L, and both are 0. So the initial state has total angular momentum J=0.

When they emit a particle X, which has its own spin, but I think mainly, we're concerned with the orbital angular momentum part. Because the emitted particle's spin might affect things, but perhaps the problem is mainly about parity and angular momentum conservation.

But wait, the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity conservation.

The parity of the initial state: it's 1S0. The parity P for a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Since it's S state, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

Now the final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X. But I think the process is that the two nucleons (NN) go into a new state, and emit X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.

But wait, the question is about the allowed partial waves. Partial waves are characterized by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle. So for each option, the emitted X has a certain l.

So parity of the final state (NN + X) must equal initial parity. But the initial parity is 1.

Wait, but the parity of the final state would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. Because when you have two objects, their combined parity is the product of their individual parities. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the system is the NN pair and X. The process is NN (initial) → NN (final) + X. So the parity of the entire system (NN_initial) is the same as (NN_final) × X_parity × (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission of X.

Wait, no. When a particle X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and X is l. So the orbital part contributes (-1)^l to the parity. So the total parity should be the initial parity, which is 1.

So the equation for parity conservation is:

P_initial = P_final × (-1)^l × P_X.

Wait, P_initial is 1 because the initial state is 1S0 with L=0 → parity 1.

P_final is the parity of the NN_final state, which would be (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the new NN state.

P_X is the intrinsic parity of X, which is given as -1.

So the equation is:

1 = [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1)^l ] * (-1)

Wait, because the emitted particle has parity P_X = -1.

Wait, let me think. The initial state parity is P_initial = 1. The final state is the product of the parity of the NN_final state (P_NN_final = (-1)^{L'} ), the parity of X (P_X = -1), and the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X, which is l. So the orbital part contributes (-1)^l.

So, the parity equation becomes:

P_initial = P_NN_final × P_X × (-1)^l.

So,

1 = (-1)^{L'} × (-1) × (-1)^l.

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

Because (-1)^{L'} × (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1}, and then multiplied by (-1)^l gives (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

So the equation becomes:

1 = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.

Which implies that:

(-1)^{L' + l + 1} = 1.

Which means that L' + l + 1 must be even.

So L' + l + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which implies L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So L' and l must be of opposite parity. One is even, the other odd.

Now, the other condition we have is from Pauli statistics: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

But the final NN state has T=0. So,

0 = S + L' + 1 mod 2.

Which implies S + L' ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L' must be of opposite parity.

So let's recap the conditions:

1. S + L' ≡ 1 mod 2 → S and L' have opposite parity.

2. L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2 → L' and l have opposite parity.

So combining these, S and L' are opposite (from condition 1), and L' and l are opposite (condition 2). Therefore, S and l must be the same parity.

So S ≡ l mod 2.

Because if L' is opposite to S, and L' is opposite to l, then S must be same as l.

So S and l must have the same parity.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. The initial state has S = 0 (from 1S0, (2S+1)=1 → S=0). The initial angular momentum J is 0 (since L=0 and S=0, so J=0).

When the particle X is emitted, the process is:

Initial state: NN (1S0, J=0) → NN (some state) + X.

The total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0.

The final state's angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's angular momentum (J_final) and the X's angular momentum (j_X). But wait, angular momentum is additive. So for the total angular momentum to be conserved, the initial J_initial must equal the total J_final, which is the vector sum of the NN's J and X's j.

But since X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l between NN and X contributes to the angular momentum. So the total is J_NN' (the NN's total angular momentum) plus j_X (the spin of X) plus l (the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is a vector). But wait, perhaps it's more correct to think in terms of the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X system.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is l, and the spin of X is s. But in this problem, since the X is a boson or fermion, but perhaps it's more about the orbital part.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the reaction.

The initial state is NN in 1S0, which is a state with L=0 (S state) and S=0 (singlet spin). So the initial total angular momentum J is 0.

In the final state, the NN system has some state with certain L' and S'. The X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l and spin s. So the total angular momentum is the sum of J_NN' and j_X, but in terms of quantum numbers, we have to consider that the orbital angular momentum l is part of the system. So the total angular momentum must be J_initial = 0.

Hmm, but perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum l (from the emission of X) must be such that when added to the NN's angular momentum, the total is conserved.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think that the orbital angular momentum l is part of the process, and the total angular momentum is conserved as the sum of the NN's angular momentum J_NN' and the X's angular momentum (which includes its spin and orbital parts).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach each option one by one, considering the conditions we have.

So, the conditions we have are:

1. For the parity: L' + l must be odd (from above).

2. For Pauli's condition: S' + L' must be odd.

3. Additionally, since the initial J is 0, the sum of the final J_NN' and X's angular momentum must be 0. But J_NN' is sqrt( (S'(S'+1) + L'(L'+1) + ... ) ), but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can consider that the orbital angular momentum l and the spin of X affect the allowed transitions. But maybe the main focus is on the quantum numbers' parities.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only about the orbital angular momentum's parity and the conditions, so maybe we can proceed without considering the spin of X.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the allowed combinations based on the conditions we have.

Let me list the conditions again:

- L' + l must be odd (from parity conservation).

- S' + L' must be odd (from Pauli's condition).

So combining these, S' and l must have the same parity. Because, since L' must be opposite to both S' and l, and S' and l are connected via L', they must have the same parity.

So each option gives a specific transition, and I need to check whether these conditions hold.

Wait, each option shows the initial state (1S0) → a new state (like 7D1) plus a particle (like p), where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. I think the letters correspond to the orbital angular momentum l of X. Because:

- s → l=0,

- p → l=1,

- d → l=2,

- f → l=3, etc.

So for each option, I can determine l and the final NN state's L' and S'.

Wait, the final NN state in each option is given as, e.g., 7D1. So the term is (2S'+1) L' J.

For example, 7D1:

- (2S' +1) =7 → S'=3,

- L' is D → L'=2,

- J=1.

So the final state's S' is 3, L'=2.

Wait, so for each option, the final NN state's S' and L' can be determined.

Then, we can check the conditions:

1. Pauli condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → 0 = (S' + L' +1) mod 2.

So S' + L' +1 must be even → S' + L' must be odd.

2. Parity condition: L' + l must be odd.

So let's go through each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the emitted X has l=p → l=1.

The final NN state is 7D1 → (2S'+1)=7 → S'=3; L'=D=2.

So S' =3, L'=2.

Check Pauli condition: S' + L' mod 2 = 3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2=1. So 3+2=5 → 5+1=6 mod2=0. So T=0, which matches the given.

So condition 1 is satisfied.

Now, check parity condition: L' + l must be 2 +1=3, which is odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

So both conditions hold. So Option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

X is p → l=1.

Final NN state is 3S1.

So (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=S → L'=0.

So S'=1, L'=0.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =1+0=1 → 1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0, which is correct.

Parity condition: L'=0, l=1. 0+1=1 → odd. So condition 2 holds.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 → 3D3 + f.

X is f → l=3.

Final state is 3D3.

(2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=D=2.

So S'=1, L'=2.

Pauli condition: 1+2=3 → 3 +1=4 mod2=0 → T=0. So condition 1 holds.

Parity condition: L'=2, l=3. 2+3=5 → odd. So condition 2 holds.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

X is s → l=0.

Final state is 3P0.

(2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L'=P=1.

So S'=1, L'=1.

Pauli condition: 1 +1 =2 → 2+1=3 mod2=1. So 1+1+1=3 mod2=1. So T would be 1, but the problem states T=0. So this condition is not satisfied. Therefore, option D violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The Pauli condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, T is given as 0. So S + L +1 must be even → S + L must be odd.

In option D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → even. So 2 +1=3. 3 mod 2 is 1. So T would be 1, but the final T is 0. So this condition is violated. Therefore, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but let me double-check the conditions. For option D:

S'=1, L'=1.

So S + L +1 mod 2 → 1+1+1=3 → 3 mod2=1. So T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So this transition is not permitted.

So the forbidden one is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state, the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum satisfy:
   \[
   T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \(T(NN) = 0\), this implies:
   \[
   S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Thus, \(S(NN)\) and \(L(NN)\) must have opposite parity.

2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state (1S0) has parity \(P_{\text{initial}} = 1\). The parity of the final state is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l,
   \]
   where \(P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L(NN)}\), \(P_X = -1\) (intrinsic parity of the emitted particle), and \(l\) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Since \(P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}}\), we have:
   \[
   1 = (-1)^{L(NN)} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^l \quad \Rightarrow \quad (-1)^{L(NN) + l + 1} = 1.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   L(NN) + l + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad L(NN) + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Thus, \(L(NN)\) and \(l\) must have opposite parity.

3. **Combining Conditions**: From the Pauli condition, \(S(NN)\) and \(L(NN)\) have opposite parity. From the parity conservation condition, \(L(NN)\) and \(l\) have opposite parity. Therefore, \(S(NN)\) and \(l\) must have the same parity.

Now, we analyze each option:

### Option A: \(1S0 \to 7D1 + p\)
- Final NN state: \(7D1\), so \(S(NN) = 3\) (from \(2S+1 = 7\)) and \(L(NN) = 2\) (from \(D\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 1\) (from \(p\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option B: \(1S0 \to 3S1 + p\)
- Final NN state: \(3S1\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 0\) (from \(S\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 1\) (from \(p\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option C: \(1S0 \to 3D3 + f\)
- Final NN state: \(3D3\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 2\) (from \(D\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 3\) (from \(f\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

### Option D: \(1S0 \to 3P0 + s\)
- Final NN state: \(3P0\), so \(S(NN) = 1\) (from \(2S+1 = 3\)) and \(L(NN) = 1\) (from \(P\)).
- Pauli condition: \(S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition **not satisfied**.
- Emitted particle: \(l = 0\) (from \(s\)).
- Parity condition: \(L(NN) + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)\). Condition satisfied.
- Since the Pauli condition is violated, this transition is **not allowed**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**.
