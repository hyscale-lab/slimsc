Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which typically happens when a molecule has chiral centers. But wait, there are exceptions too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or something. So I need to go through each compound and figure out if they have any chiral centers or other features that might make them non-optically active.

Let's list the compounds one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is a butene with substituents. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, which is CH2Cl, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Now, is this compound chiral? Let me see. For a double bond, the configuration is Z. The substituents on either end of the double bond are ClCH2 and CH(CH3), and on the other side, CH2. Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 (since it's CH2Cl on one end and CH(CH3) on C2). Wait, maybe not. Wait, but the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the groups on C1 are Cl, CH2 (from CH2Cl), and two Hs? Wait, no, perhaps. Wait, the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, CH2- group (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl on C1, which is the same as C where the double bond starts. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene? Maybe.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The double bond is between C1 and C2, so C2 has a CH(CH3), and C1 has Cl and another CH2 group. Wait, but the double bond is on C1, so maybe the substituents are Cl on C1, and on C2, perhaps a CH(CH3) group. But in a double bond, each carbon can't have four substituents if it's part of a double bond. So C1 is CH2Cl (but wait, no, perhaps it's CHCl2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl, so Cl attached to C1. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH=CHCH3? No, wait, but the substituents are Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So, the carbons are C1: Cl, CH2 (from the butene), and the double bond. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms in the chain and two substituents. So for C1, perhaps it's Cl, CH2 (the rest of the chain), and two Hs? No, wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has CH2Cl (but that's a single bond), wait no, because it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the C1 is CH2Cl, and C2 is CH(CH3). But that doesn't make sense because a double bond would have each carbon bonded to two other carbons or substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is connected via a double bond to C2 which has a CH(CH3) group and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's more like Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. That would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So for C2, the substituents are CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two Hs? No, wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So, perhaps each of those carbons (C1 and C2) are connected via a double bond, and each has other substituents. But in any case, the key is whether there's a chiral center.

Wait, but in the structure, is there a carbon with four different substituents? Let me think. C1 here is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So the groups around C1 would be Cl, two CH2 groups (but wait, perhaps it's not a chiral center because the double bond restricts rotation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2, making those sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. So if all the substituents are on sp³ carbons, then we might have chiral centers.

Wait, but in this case, the (Z) configuration refers to the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are each connected to other groups. So for C1, the groups are Cl, two CH2 groups, and a double bond. Wait, but maybe the molecule is planar around the double bond, so those carbons can't have a chiral center. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps there's another carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, considering the entire molecule: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. The CH(CH3) is on C2. Is that carbon a chiral center? Let's see. The groups attached to C2 would be CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two Hs? Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, C2 is connected via double bond to C1, and via single bonds to CH(CH3), and perhaps another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are (from C2): one H, one CH(CH3), one double bond to C1, and another substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are sp², so they can't be chiral. The adjacent carbons (like C3) might have substituents but are they chiral?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the CH(CH3) is on C2, which is double-bonded to C1. So C2 has CH(CH3), and on either side of the double bond, which I think would mean that C2 has the groups CH(CH3), CH2Cl (from C1), and two Hs. Wait, but if it's double-bonded, then C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), CH(CH3), and two other Hs? So the substituents would be CH(CH3), two Hs, and the double bond. But wait, that's only three substituents, so maybe it's not a chiral center. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Or am I missing something?

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the next compound and come back if I have time.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's try to break it down. It's a hexahydro-something, so it probably has a fused ring system. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-?), attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as 3aR,7aS,E. The E configuration suggests a double bond. So, the molecule has a double bond in a certain position.

But wait, the presence of multiple rings and substituents might introduce chiral centers. The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry, but the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality. So, the molecule has specific stereocenters at 3a and 7a, which are R and S configurations respectively. So these are chiral centers, making the molecule chiral. So this compound is optically active. So that's one.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So with 2 and 3 methyl groups, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the stereochemistry is 2R and 3S. So each of those CH(CH3) groups are chiral centers because each has four different substituents. For C2: groups are CH(CH3), two CH2 (from the adjacent carbons), and the two COOH groups? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each becomes CH(CH3). So for C2: attached groups would be HOOC-, CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a CH2 from the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let me think. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups at C2 and C3 would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for C2: substituents are (i) the succinic acid chain (like the carbonyl groups?), (ii) a methyl group, (iii) the adjacent CH(CH3) group, and (iv) another CH2 group? Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual substituents around each carbon.

For C2: it's connected to C1 (which is -COOH), C3 (which is -CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups from the methyl substituent. Wait, no, because C2 in succinic acid is CH2, but when it's CH(CH3), that's a branch. So the groups around C2 would be: (a) a methyl group (CH3), (b) the adjacent C1 (which is a carbonyl group), (c) the adjacent C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and (d) another CH2 group? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the C2 has four different groups: CH3 (methyl), COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and another CH2 or something else. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the inner CH(CH3) groups are attached to the COOH groups on either side. So C2: attached to (i) a COOH group (from C1), (ii) a CH(CH3) (from C3), (iii) a CH3 (methyl), and (iv) another CH(CH3) from across? Wait, no. Wait, each CH(CH3) is connected to C2 and C3. So for C2: groups are (a) COOH, (b) the adjacent C3 (which is CH(CH3)), (c) a methyl group (CH3), and (d) another CH2 or something else? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, C2 is connected to (a) COOH, (b) CH(CH3) (from C3), (c) CH3, and (d) another CH2 group leading to the next COOH. Hmm, but perhaps all four substituents are different. If so, then C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have (a) CH(CH3), (b) COOH, (c) CH3, and (d) another CH(CH3) from C2. Wait, but in that case, maybe C3 isn't a chiral center because the substituents are the same as C2's. Wait, no, because each has different substituents.

Wait, for C2: substituents are (i) COOH (from the first carbon), (ii) CH(CH3) (from C3), (iii) CH3 (methyl), and (iv) another CH2 group. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each of the inner CH(CH3) groups are connected to the two COOH groups on either end and each has a methyl branch. So for each of C2 and C3, their substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3) (from the other carbon), methyl, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps in this case, both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers, making it a chiral molecule and thus optically active. So that's another one.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
So similar to the previous compound, but both C2 and C3 are R configuration. So the structure is the same, with two methyl groups on C2 and C3. Are both of these chiral centers? As in the previous case, if each has four different substituents, then yes. So this molecule is also chiral and optically active. So that's the third.

Wait, but wait. Are there any internal planes of symmetry here? Because if the configuration is R,R, maybe the molecule is meso. Let me think. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two chiral centers mirror images of each other, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. So in this case, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH with both C2 and C3 being R configuration. Does this lead to a plane of symmetry?

If the two chiral centers are identical (same substituents), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry between them, it could be a meso compound. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R centers but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be meso and thus not chiral. But wait, in this case, the substituents are methyl groups on both C2 and C3. So each has a methyl, a COOH on each end, and the same groups on each. So if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound. Let me imagine: if the molecule is symmetric along the central axis, then the two chiral centers would mirror each other. So in that case, the molecule would be achiral, even though each center is R.

Wait, but in this case, both are R. So in a meso compound, the centers are opposite, like R and S, but if both are R, then maybe the molecule isn't meso. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For a meso compound, you need identical stereocenters that are mirror images. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, each stereocenter is R and S in a way that the overall molecule is achiral. But in this case, the two stereocenters are both R, so it's not a meso form because the substituents on each would be arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So this would make the molecule chiral, hence optically active. So this is another compound that's optically active. So that's the fourth.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl groups and the rest is symmetric, maybe the molecule is achiral. For example, if the two centers are identical and the molecule is symmetric, then it's meso. Wait, let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl and the same on each. So if the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration would be R and S on each center. But in this case, both are R. So that would create a chiral molecule, not a meso one. So the molecule would be chiral and thus optically active. So yes, this is another optically active compound. Now that's four.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, then the two centers are mirror images. So if both are R, that would mean that the molecule isn't symmetric, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is meso. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso because the two stereocenters are both R, making the molecule chiral. So I'll go with it being optically active. So that's another one.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en). The configuration is R. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Now, is there a chiral center here?

Yes, because C1 has the OH group, and in the cyclohexene ring, C1 is attached to three other carbons (the ring) and the OH. So four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (or similar), and another substituent. Wait, no. Let me think: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and the OH group. So the substituents on C1 would be: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and the double bond's effect. Wait, no, because C1 is in the ring, so perhaps the substituents are a hydrogen, two adjacent ring carbons, and the OH. So, perhaps C1 is a chiral center because it has four different substituents. If so, then the molecule is chiral and optically active. So that's the fifth.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is 1s,3s,5s. Now, does this molecule have any planes of symmetry that would make it achiral despite having chiral centers?

Well, considering the positions, 1,3,5 are all on alternate carbons. So the structure is symmetric in a way that perhaps the molecule is achiral. For example, if all three OH groups are on the same face (cis), but that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, but regardless, let's think about the configuration.

Each of the OH groups is on a chiral center. So each of C1, C3, and C5 has four different substituents. But the question is whether the overall molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be achiral. For example, suppose the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically. Let me imagine: the cyclohexane ring is symmetric, and each OH is at 120-degree positions. So, if the configurations are all s, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but for a molecule to be meso, it must have at least two chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. In this case, maybe the molecule is achiral because of symmetry. So perhaps this compound is not optically active.

Alternatively, if the molecule doesn't have any plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. For instance, if the OH groups are on the same face, maybe the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion. For cyclohexane with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps it's symmetric if the configurations are such that it's a meso form.

Wait, in the case of triols, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be meso. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that each pair is mirror images across a plane. So, perhaps (1s,3s,5s) could be a meso form.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso because the three stereocenters don't create a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: think about the number of stereoisomers possible. For three stereocenters, there are 2^3 = 8 possible stereoisomers. But some of them may be meso. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would reduce the number of stereoisomers. In this case, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration has a plane of symmetry, making the molecule meso and thus achiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Hmm. Without a clear way to determine, perhaps I should proceed and come back.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is a ketone (butan-1-one), so the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3C(O)CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO something? Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO something? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's write it carefully.

Butan-1-one would be (CH2)3CO. So, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible; wait, butanone is actually either (CH3)2CO (2-butanone) or CH3CH2COCH3 (3-butanone). Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO but that doesn't make sense because you need four carbons. Oh, wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3CO, which is not possible because the carbonyl would be at the end. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, which isn't a real structure. Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's not a real compound because the carbonyl can't be at the end. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)3CO with the carbonyl at the end, but that's not possible because it would be a ketone, which requires two R groups on the carbonyl carbon. So perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group, and then a chain leading to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one would be four carbons, with the ketone at the end. So the correct structure would be: the carbonyl is at C1, attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a ketone, and the rest is a three-carbon chain ending with a methyl. So, structure: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should focus on whether there's a chiral center.

Looking for any chiral centers in the molecule. The cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two other groups (maybe a methyl and a CH2 group). Wait, no, because the carbonyl carbon can't have four substituents; it's double-bonded to O, so it's a trigonal planar. So any chiral centers must be elsewhere.

Looking at the butan-1-one part: perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, but that's pentan-1-one with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at C1, and the next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. So the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: so the carbonyl is at C1, attached to cyclopentyl, and the rest is a butyl group with a methyl on C3. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make it pentan-1-one, but perhaps I'm getting the nomenclature wrong.

In any case, looking for chiral centers. The C2 in this structure would be attached to the carbonyl group, a CH2 group, a CH(CH3) group, and another CH2 group. So the substituents on C2 would be: (a) C(O) (from C1), (b) CH2CH(CH3)CH3 (maybe), (c) CH2CH3, and (d) another CH2 group. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the C3 is a chiral center. Let's see.

Wait, the carbonyl is at C1, so C2 is attached to C1 (C=O), C3, and two more groups. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (with methyl) - C4 - C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for any possible chiral centers.

If C3 has a methyl group, then perhaps it's attached to four different groups. For example, if C3 has a methyl, a CH2 group leading to C4, a CH2 group leading to C2, and another substituent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe C3 is connected to a methyl, a CH2CH3, and two other CH2 groups. In that case, it might not be a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has four different substituents.

Wait, in any case, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group itself has a substituent arrangement that creates chirality, but I don't think so because the cyclopentyl is a ring and unless it's substituted in a specific way, it's unlikely to have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: think about possible symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it will be chiral.

In this case, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the substituents are a cyclopentyl group on C1 (the carbonyl), a methyl on C3, and the rest are CH2 groups. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should assume that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but maybe C3 is a chiral center. Let me think: for C3, the substituents would be (a) a CH2 group leading to C2 (which is connected to the carbonyl), (b) a CH(CH3) group (if C3 has a methyl), (c) a CH2 group leading to C4, and (d) perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, because if C3 is CH(CH3), then the groups would be CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is a quaternary carbon, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe C3 is connected to four different groups, making it a chiral center. If that's the case, then the molecule would be chiral and optically active. So that's another one. So that would make it the sixth.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to figure this out. The structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, attached to a cyclopentyl group. The chain is C1 (CO), C2 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), and C4 (CH2CH3). So C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3), a methyl group (CH3), and perhaps a hydrogen? No, because C3 must have four bonds. Wait, C3 would be connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3), a methyl (CH3), and another CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3) with substituents: one CH2 (from C2), one CH2CH3 (from C4), one CH3 (methyl), and a hydrogen. Wait, if that's the case, then C3 would have four different substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), CH3, and H. So yes, that makes C3 a chiral center. So this molecule would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So that's the sixth.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the molecule would have a chiral center, so it's optically active. So that's the sixth compound that's optically active.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recap:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. So not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers, so yes.

3. (2R,3S)-... : Two chiral centers, so yes.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Both R, but if meso, no. But earlier I thought it's not meso. Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, earlier I thought that (2R,3R) would be a meso compound if the substituents create a plane of symmetry. So if the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso form and not chiral. So, for example, in the case of 2R,3S, it would be a different stereoisomer. But if both are R, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, for the succinic acid case, the (2R,3S) configuration is the meso form, right? No, wait, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R centers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When both CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3), the molecule becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. For this molecule, if the configurations are 2R and 3S, then it's a meso compound because there's a plane of symmetry. But if both are R, then it's not a meso compound and thus chiral.

Wait, but if both are R, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So the (2R,3R) configuration would be a chiral molecule, whereas the (2R,3S) would be a meso form if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, but in this case, both substituents are methyl groups. So, if the two stereocenters are both R, then the molecule is chiral. But if one is R and the other is S, then perhaps it's a meso form. So in this case, 2R,3R would be a chiral molecule, making it optically active. So that's another one.

Wait, but I thought the (2R,3S) configuration would be meso. So let me think again: if the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration would have an even number of stereocenters, and the configurations would mirror each other. So for example, if the two stereocenters are R and S, arranged symmetrically, the molecule is meso and thus achiral. But if both are R, then there's no symmetry, so the molecule is chiral.

So, for (2R,3R), the molecule is chiral, so it's optically active. So that's another one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this, but I'll proceed.

So, compiling the results:

Compound 1: No chirality → Not active.

Compound 2: Yes → 1.

Compound 3: Yes → 2.

Compound 4: Yes → 3.

Compound 5: Yes →4.

Compound 6: Let's get back to it. Earlier, I thought it was yes, but I'm not sure. But if C3 is a chiral center, then yes. So that's 5.

Compound 7: Earlier I thought it's yes, making it 6. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me recount:

1. No → 0.

2. Yes → 1.

3. Yes → 2.

4. Yes →3.

5. Yes →4.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Earlier, I thought it might be a meso form, thus not active. So no → still at 4.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: If C3 is a chiral center, then yes →5.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about each compound.

Compound 1: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. As the double bond is between C1 and C2, and both are sp² hybridized. No chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Compound 2: Has chiral centers (3aR,7aS), so yes.

Compound 3: (2R,3S) → two chiral centers, making it a meso compound? Or not? Wait, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, like with a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it's meso. So, for example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, but the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso and not chiral. But wait, in this case, both substituents are methyl groups, so the arrangement would allow for a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So for (2R,3S), the molecule is meso and thus not optically active. But for (2R,3R), it's not meso, so it's chiral.

Wait, this changes things. So for compound 3: (2R,3S), if it's a meso compound, then it's not optically active. So that would be no.

Compound 4: (2R,3R) → if not meso, then yes. So yes → count increases.

Compound 5: (R) configuration on C1 → yes.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s) → if the molecule is symmetric, it's meso → no.

Compound 7: If C3 is a chiral center → yes.

Wait, but let me reevaluate:

Compound 3: (2R,3S) → if the molecule is symmetric, it's meso and thus not chiral.

Compound 4: (2R,3R) → not symmetric, so chiral.

So now, the count would be:

1. No → 0.

2. Yes → 1.

3. No → 1 remains.

4. Yes →2.

5. Yes →3.

6. No →3.

7. Yes →4.

So, the total would be 4 optically active compounds.

Wait, but this depends on whether compound 3 is a meso compound. Let me think again. For 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (2R,3S) would be a meso form, right? Because the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. So in that case, compound 3 is not active, and compound 4 (2R,3R) is active.

So the count would be:

Compounds 2,4,5,7 → four.

Wait, but let's count each:

1. No →0.

2. Yes →1.

3. No →1.

4. Yes →2.

5. Yes →3.

6. No →3.

7. Yes →4.

So the answer would be 4, which corresponds to option D:4.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Another way: let's list which compounds are active.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. Yes.

So 1,2,4,5,7 → wait, no, that would be five. Wait, no:

Wait, no, let me recount:

Compounds:

1: No →0.

2: Yes →1.

3: No →1.

4: Yes →2.

5: Yes →3.

6: No →3.

7: Yes →4.

So four active compounds.

So the answer is D) 4.

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another feature (e.g., a plane of symmetry) that makes it non-chiral. Here's the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, making these carbons sp² hybridized. 
- Chiral centers require sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents. Since the carbons in the double bond are sp², they cannot be chiral centers.
- **Optical activity:** No.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
- The molecule has a fused ring system with stereocenters at positions 3a (R) and 7a (S). These are sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents.
- **Optical activity:** Yes.

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers with four different substituents.
- However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.
- **Optical activity:** No.

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers with four different substituents.
- Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, the (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry, so it is not a meso compound.
- **Optical activity:** Yes.

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**

- **Optical activity:** Yes.

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
- The molecule has OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons is sp³ hybridized and has four different substituents.
- The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.
- **Optical activity:** No.

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
- The molecule has a cyclopentyl group on C1 (the carbonyl carbon) and a methyl group on C3. C3 is sp³ hybridized and has four different substituents (CH₂ groups, CH(CH₃), and a hydrogen).

Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which typically happens when a molecule has chiral centers. But wait, there are exceptions too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or something. So I need to go through each compound and figure out if they have any chiral centers or other features that might make them non-optically active.

Let's list the compounds one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is a butene with substituents. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, which is CH2Cl, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Now, is this compound chiral? Let me see. For a double bond, the configuration is Z. The substituents on either end of the double bond are ClCH2 and CH(CH3), and on the other side, CH2. Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 (since it's CH2Cl on one end and CH(CH3) on C2). Wait, maybe not. Wait, but the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the groups on C1 are Cl, CH2 (from CH2Cl), and two Hs? Wait, no, perhaps. Wait, the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, CH2- group (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl on C1, which is the same as C where the double bond starts. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene? Maybe.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The double bond is between C1 and C2, so C2 has a CH(CH3), and C1 has Cl and another CH2 group. Wait, but the double bond is on C1, so maybe the substituents are Cl on C1, and on C2, perhaps a CH(CH3) group. But in a double bond, each carbon can't have four substituents if it's part of a double bond. So C1 is CH2Cl (but wait, no, perhaps it's CHCl2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl, so Cl attached to C1. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH=CHCH3? No, wait, but the substituents are Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So, the carbons are C1: Cl, CH2 (from the butene), and the double bond. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms in the chain and two substituents. So for C1, perhaps it's Cl, CH2 (the rest of the chain), and two Hs? No, wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has CH2Cl (but that's a single bond), wait no, because it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the C1 is CH2Cl, and C2 is CH(CH3). But that doesn't make sense because a double bond would have each carbon bonded to two other carbons or substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is connected via a double bond to C2 which has a CH(CH3) group and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's more like Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. That would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So for C2, the substituents are CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two Hs? No, wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So, perhaps each of those carbons (C1 and C2) are connected via a double bond, and each has other substituents. But in any case, the key is whether there's a chiral center.

Wait, but in the structure, is there a carbon with four different substituents? Let me think. C1 here is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So the groups around C1 would be Cl, two CH2 groups (but wait, perhaps it's not a chiral center because the double bond restricts rotation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2, making those sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. So if all the substituents are on sp³ carbons, then we might have chiral centers.

Wait, but in this case, the (Z) configuration refers to the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are each connected to other groups. So for C1, the groups are Cl, two CH2 groups, and a double bond. Wait, but maybe the molecule is planar around the double bond, so those carbons can't have a chiral center. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps there's another carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, considering the entire molecule: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. The CH(CH3) is on C2. Is that carbon a chiral center? Let's see. The groups attached to C2 would be CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two Hs? Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, C2 is connected via double bond to C1, and via single bonds to CH(CH3), and perhaps another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are (from C2): one H, one CH(CH3), one double bond to C1, and another substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are sp², so they can't be chiral. The adjacent carbons (like C3) might have substituents but are they chiral?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. So the CH(CH3) is on C2, which is double-bonded to C1. So C2 has CH(CH3), and on either side of the double bond, which I think would mean that C2 has the groups CH(CH3), CH2Cl (from C1), and two Hs. Wait, but if it's double-bonded, then C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), CH(CH3), and two other Hs? So the substituents would be CH(CH3), two Hs, and the double bond. But wait, that's only three substituents, so maybe it's not a chiral center. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Or am I missing something?

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the next compound and come back if I have time.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's try to break it down. It's a hexahydro-something, so it probably has a fused ring system. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-?), attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as 3aR,7aS,E. The E configuration suggests a double bond. So, the molecule has a double bond in a certain position.

But wait, the presence of multiple rings and substituents might introduce chiral centers. The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry, but the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality. So, the molecule has specific stereocenters at 3a and 7a, which are R and S configurations respectively. So these are chiral centers, making the molecule chiral. So this compound is optically active. So that's one.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So with 2 and 3 methyl groups, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the stereochemistry is 2R and 3S. So each of those CH(CH3) groups are chiral centers because each has four different substituents. For C2: groups are CH(CH3), two CH2 (from the adjacent carbons), and the two COOH groups? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each becomes CH(CH3). So for C2: attached groups would be HOOC-, CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a CH2 from the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let me think. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups at C2 and C3 would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for C2: substituents are (i) the succinic acid chain (like the carbonyl groups?), (ii) a methyl group, (iii) the adjacent CH(CH3) group, and (iv) another CH2 group? Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual substituents around each carbon.

For C2: it's connected to C1 (which is -COOH), C3 (which is -CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups from the methyl substituent. Wait, no, because C2 in succinic acid is CH2, but when it's CH(CH3), that's a branch. So the groups around C2 would be: (a) a methyl group (CH3), (b) the adjacent C1 (which is a carbonyl group), (c) the adjacent C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and (d) another CH2 group? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the C2 has four different groups: CH3 (methyl), COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and another CH2 or something else. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the inner CH(CH3) groups are attached to the COOH groups on either side. So C2: attached to (i) a COOH group (from C1), (ii) a CH(CH3) (from C3), (iii) a CH3 (methyl), and (iv) another CH(CH3) from across? Wait, no. Wait, each CH(CH3) is connected to C2 and C3. So for C2: groups are (a) COOH, (b) the adjacent C3 (which is CH(CH3)), (c) a methyl group (CH3), and (d) another CH2 or something else? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, C2 is connected to (a) COOH, (b) CH(CH3) (from C3), (c) CH3, and (d) another CH2 group leading to the next COOH. Hmm, but perhaps all four substituents are different. If so, then C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have (a) CH(CH3), (b) COOH, (c) CH3, and (d) another CH(CH3) from C2. Wait, but in that case, maybe C3 isn't a chiral center because the substituents are the same as C2's. Wait, no, because each has different substituents.

Wait, for C2: substituents are (i) COOH (from the first carbon), (ii) CH(CH3) (from C3), (iii) CH3 (methyl), and (iv) another CH2 group. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each of the inner CH(CH3) groups are connected to the two COOH groups on either end and each has a methyl branch. So for each of C2 and C3, their substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3) (from the other carbon), methyl, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps in this case, both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers, making it a chiral molecule and thus optically active. So that's another one.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
So similar to the previous compound, but both C2 and C3 are R configuration. So the structure is the same, with two methyl groups on C2 and C3. Are both of these chiral centers? As in the previous case, if each has four different substituents, then yes. So this molecule is also chiral and optically active. So that's the third.

Wait, but wait. Are there any internal planes of symmetry here? Because if the configuration is R,R, maybe the molecule is meso. Let me think. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two chiral centers mirror images of each other, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. So in this case, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH with both C2 and C3 being R configuration. Does this lead to a plane of symmetry?

If the two chiral centers are identical (same substituents), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry between them, it could be a meso compound. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R centers but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be meso and thus not chiral. But wait, in this case, the substituents are methyl groups on both C2 and C3. So each has a methyl, a COOH on each end, and the same groups on each. So if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound. Let me imagine: if the molecule is symmetric along the central axis, then the two chiral centers would mirror each other. So in that case, the molecule would be achiral, even though each center is R.

Wait, but in this case, both are R. So in a meso compound, the centers are opposite, like R and S, but if both are R, then maybe the molecule isn't meso. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For a meso compound, you need identical stereocenters that are mirror images. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, each stereocenter is R and S in a way that the overall molecule is achiral. But in this case, the two stereocenters are both R, so it's not a meso form because the substituents on each would be arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So this would make the molecule chiral, hence optically active. So this is another compound that's optically active. So that's the fourth.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl groups and the rest is symmetric, maybe the molecule is achiral. For example, if the two centers are identical and the molecule is symmetric, then it's meso. Wait, let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl and the same on each. So if the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration would be R and S on each center. But in this case, both are R. So that would create a chiral molecule, not a meso one. So the molecule would be chiral and thus optically active. So yes, this is another optically active compound. Now that's four.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, then the two centers are mirror images. So if both are R, that would mean that the molecule isn't symmetric, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is meso. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso because the two stereocenters are both R, making the molecule chiral. So I'll go with it being optically active. So that's another one.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en). The configuration is R. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Now, is there a chiral center here?

Yes, because C1 has the OH group, and in the cyclohexene ring, C1 is attached to three other carbons (the ring) and the OH. So four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (or similar), and another substituent. Wait, no. Let me think: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and the OH group. So the substituents on C1 would be: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and the double bond's effect. Wait, no, because C1 is in the ring, so perhaps the substituents are a hydrogen, two adjacent ring carbons, and the OH. So, perhaps C1 is a chiral center because it has four different substituents. If so, then the molecule is chiral and optically active. So that's the fifth.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is 1s,3s,5s. Now, does this molecule have any planes of symmetry that would make it achiral despite having chiral centers?

Well, considering the positions, 1,3,5 are all on alternate carbons. So the structure is symmetric in a way that perhaps the molecule is achiral. For example, if all three OH groups are on the same face (cis), but that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, but regardless, let's think about the configuration.

Each of the OH groups is on a chiral center. So each of C1, C3, and C5 has four different substituents. But the question is whether the overall molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be achiral. For example, suppose the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically. Let me imagine: the cyclohexane ring is symmetric, and each OH is at 120-degree positions. So, if the configurations are all s, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but for a molecule to be meso, it must have at least two chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. In this case, maybe the molecule is achiral because of symmetry. So perhaps this compound is not optically active.

Alternatively, if the molecule doesn't have any plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. For instance, if the OH groups are on the same face, maybe the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion. For cyclohexane with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps it's symmetric if the configurations are such that it's a meso form.

Wait, in the case of triols, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be meso. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that each pair is mirror images across a plane. So, perhaps (1s,3s,5s) could be a meso form.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso because the three stereocenters don't create a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: think about the number of stereoisomers possible. For three stereocenters, there are 2^3 = 8 possible stereoisomers. But some of them may be meso. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would reduce the number of stereoisomers. In this case, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration has a plane of symmetry, making the molecule meso and thus achiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Hmm. Without a clear way to determine, perhaps I should proceed and come back.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is a ketone (butan-1-one), so the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3C(O)CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO something? Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO something? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's write it carefully.

Butan-1-one would be (CH2)3CO. So, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible; wait, butanone is actually either (CH3)2CO (2-butanone) or CH3CH2COCH3 (3-butanone). Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO but that doesn't make sense because you need four carbons. Oh, wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3CO, which is not possible because the carbonyl would be at the end. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, which isn't a real structure. Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's not a real compound because the carbonyl can't be at the end. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)3CO with the carbonyl at the end, but that's not possible because it would be a ketone, which requires two R groups on the carbonyl carbon. So perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group, and then a chain leading to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one would be four carbons, with the ketone at the end. So the correct structure would be: the carbonyl is at C1, attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a ketone, and the rest is a three-carbon chain ending with a methyl. So, structure: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should focus on whether there's a chiral center.

Looking for any chiral centers in the molecule. The cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two other groups (maybe a methyl and a CH2 group). Wait, no, because the carbonyl carbon can't have four substituents; it's double-bonded to O, so it's a trigonal planar. So any chiral centers must be elsewhere.

Looking at the butan-1-one part: perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, but that's pentan-1-one with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at C1, and the next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. So the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: so the carbonyl is at C1, attached to cyclopentyl, and the rest is a butyl group with a methyl on C3. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make it pentan-1-one, but perhaps I'm getting the nomenclature wrong.

In any case, looking for chiral centers. The C2 in this structure would be attached to the carbonyl group, a CH2 group, a CH(CH3) group, and another CH2 group. So the substituents on C2 would be: (a) C(O) (from C1), (b) CH2CH(CH3)CH3 (maybe), (c) CH2CH3, and (d) another CH2 group. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the C3 is a chiral center. Let's see.

Wait, the carbonyl is at C1, so C2 is attached to C1 (C=O), C3, and two more groups. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (with methyl) - C4 - C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for any possible chiral centers.

If C3 has a methyl group, then perhaps it's attached to four different groups. For example, if C3 has a methyl, a CH2 group leading to C4, a CH2 group leading to C2, and another substituent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe C3 is connected to a methyl, a CH2CH3, and two other CH2 groups. In that case, it might not be a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has four different substituents.

Wait, in any case, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group itself has a substituent arrangement that creates chirality, but I don't think so because the cyclopentyl is a ring and unless it's substituted in a specific way, it's unlikely to have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: think about possible symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it will be chiral.

In this case, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the substituents are a cyclopentyl group on C1 (the carbonyl), a methyl on C3, and the rest are CH2 groups. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should assume that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but maybe C3 is a chiral center. Let me think: for C3, the substituents would be (a) a CH2 group leading to C2 (which is connected to the carbonyl), (b) a CH(CH3) group (if C3 has a methyl), (c) a CH2 group leading to C4, and (d) perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, because if C3 is CH(CH3), then the groups would be CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is a quaternary carbon, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe C3 is connected to four different groups, making it a chiral center. If that's the case, then the molecule would be chiral and optically active. So that's another one. So that would make it the sixth.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to figure this out. The structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, attached to a cyclopentyl group. The chain is C1 (CO), C2 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), and C4 (CH2CH3). So C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3), a methyl group (CH3), and perhaps a hydrogen? No, because C3 must have four bonds. Wait, C3 would be connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3), a methyl (CH3), and another CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3) with substituents: one CH2 (from C2), one CH2CH3 (from C4), one CH3 (methyl), and a hydrogen. Wait, if that's the case, then C3 would have four different substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), CH3, and H. So yes, that makes C3 a chiral center. So this molecule would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So that's the sixth.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the molecule would have a chiral center, so it's optically active. So that's the sixth compound that's optically active.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recap:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. So not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers, so yes.

3. (2R,3S)-... : Two chiral centers, so yes.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Both R, but if meso, no. But earlier I thought it's not meso. Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, earlier I thought that (2R,3R) would be a meso compound if the substituents create a plane of symmetry. So if the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso form and not chiral. So, for example, in the case of 2R,3S, it would be a different stereoisomer. But if both are R, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, for the succinic acid case, the (2R,3S) configuration is the meso form, right? No, wait, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R centers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When both CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3), the molecule becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. For this molecule, if the configurations are 2R and 3S, then it's a meso compound because there's a plane of symmetry. But if both are R, then it's not a meso compound and thus chiral.

Wait, but if both are R, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So the (2R,3R) configuration would be a chiral molecule, whereas the (2R,3S) would be a meso form if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, but in this case, both substituents are methyl groups. So, if the two stereocenters are both R, then the molecule is chiral. But if one is R and the other is S, then perhaps it's a meso form. So in this case, 2R,3R would be a chiral molecule, making it optically active. So that's another one.

Wait, but I thought the (2R,3S) configuration would be meso. So let me think again: if the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration would have an even number of stereocenters, and the configurations would mirror each other. So for example, if the two stereocenters are R and S, arranged symmetrically, the molecule is meso and thus achiral. But if both are R, then there's no symmetry, so the molecule is chiral.

So, for (2R,3R), the molecule is chiral, so it's optically active. So that's another one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this, but I'll proceed.

So, compiling the results:

Compound 1: No chirality → Not active.

Compound 2: Yes → 1.

Compound 3: Yes → 2.

Compound 4: Yes → 3.

Compound 5: Yes →4.

Compound 6: Let's get back to it. Earlier, I thought it was yes, but I'm not sure. But if C3 is a chiral center, then yes. So that's 5.

Compound 7: Earlier I thought it's yes, making it 6. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me recount:

1. No → 0.

2. Yes → 1.

3. Yes → 2.

4. Yes →3.

5. Yes →4.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Earlier, I thought it might be a meso form, thus not active. So no → still at 4.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: If C3 is a chiral center, then yes →5.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about each compound.

Compound 1: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. As the double bond is between C1 and C2, and both are sp² hybridized. No chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Compound 2: Has chiral centers (3aR,7aS), so yes.

Compound 3: (2R,3S) → two chiral centers, making it a meso compound? Or not? Wait, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, like with a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it's meso. So, for example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, but the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso and not chiral. But wait, in this case, both substituents are methyl groups, so the arrangement would allow for a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So for (2R,3S), the molecule is meso and thus not optically active. But for (2R,3R), it's not meso, so it's chiral.

Wait, this changes things. So for compound 3: (2R,3S), if it's a meso compound, then it's not optically active. So that would be no.

Compound 4: (2R,3R) → if not meso, then yes. So yes → count increases.

Compound 5: (R) configuration on C1 → yes.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s) → if the molecule is symmetric, it's meso → no.

Compound 7: If C3 is a chiral center → yes.

Wait, but let me reevaluate:

Compound 3: (2R,3S) → if the molecule is symmetric, it's meso and thus not chiral.

Compound 4: (2R,3R) → not symmetric, so chiral.

So now, the count would be:

1. No → 0.

2. Yes → 1.

3. No → 1 remains.

4. Yes →2.

5. Yes →3.

6. No →3.

7. Yes →4.

So, the total would be 4 optically active compounds.

Wait, but this depends on whether compound 3 is a meso compound. Let me think again. For 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (2R,3S) would be a meso form, right? Because the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. So in that case, compound 3 is not active, and compound 4 (2R,3R) is active.

So the count would be:

Compounds 2,4,5,7 → four.

Wait, but let's count each:

1. No →0.

2. Yes →1.

3. No →1.

4. Yes →2.

5. Yes →3.

6. No →3.

7. Yes →4.

So the answer would be 4, which corresponds to option D:4.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Another way: let's list which compounds are active.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. Yes.

So 1,2,4,5,7 → wait, no, that would be five. Wait, no:

Wait, no, let me recount:

Compounds:

1: No →0.

2: Yes →1.

3: No →1.

4: Yes →2.

5: Yes →3.

6: No →3.

7: Yes →4.

So four active compounds.

So the answer is D) 4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another feature (e.g., a plane of symmetry) that makes it non-chiral. Here's the analysis for each compound:

---

- The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, making these carbons sp² hybridized. 
- Chiral centers require sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents. Since the carbons in the double bond are sp², they cannot be chiral centers.
- **Optical activity:** No.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
