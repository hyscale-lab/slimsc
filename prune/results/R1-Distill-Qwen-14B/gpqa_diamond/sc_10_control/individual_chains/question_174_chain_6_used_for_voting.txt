Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, just the two. The more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the other in terms of rest mass. Oh wait, the problem says one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. So if I let the smaller one be mass m, the larger would be 2m. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, does that mean M is 300 GeV/c²? Because rest mass energy is Mc², so 300 GeV would be the rest mass energy, so M = 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of initial M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M. That makes 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M each? No, wait, no. Let's compute correctly.

Wait, sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M? Wait no, no: the two fragments have masses m and 2m, so sum is 3m. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So the smaller fragment is 0.33 M and the larger is 0.66 M.

Wait, but then the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and the two fragments have rest masses m and 2m, sum 3m = 0.99 M. So M is 3m /0.99. So the initial mass is 3m /0.99. So the masses after fission are m = (0.99 M) /3 = 0.33 M, and 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c². So M = 300 GeV/c².

So the rest masses of the two fragments are m = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c², and 2m = 198 GeV/c². So each fragment has rest energies of 99 GeV and 198 GeV. Wait, but that seems way too high because the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. Oh wait, but the sum is 99 + 198 = 297 GeV, which is 99% of 300. So that's correct.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits into two fragments, they must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with some velocities.

The problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. It asks for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to compute T1 relativistic and T1_classical, then find T1 - T1_classical and see which option it matches.

Wait, but let's think about energy and momentum. The initial nucleus is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote them as p and -p.

The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. But the initial energy is just the rest energy of the nucleus, 300 GeV. So the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies of the two fragments must equal 300 GeV.

Wait, no! Wait, because in reality, when a nucleus undergoes fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. So the total rest mass after is less than before, hence the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

But in this problem, it says the sum of rest masses is 99%, so only 1% mass is converted to kinetic energy. So total energy after fission is sum of rest masses plus kinetic energies. But wait, the initial energy is all rest energy: 300 GeV.

So the equation would be:

Total energy after = sum(rest energies) + sum(KE) = 300 GeV.

Sum(rest energies) is 297 GeV, so sum(KE) is 3 GeV. Because 297 + 3 = 300.

So the two fragments have a combined kinetic energy of 3 GeV. So T1 (KE of the more massive fragment) plus T2 (KE of the less massive) equals 3 GeV.

But the question is about T1 and the relativistic vs. classical calculation.

Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is related to the speed, and since the fragments are moving, their kinetic energies can be calculated relativistically or non-relativistically.

But let me first consider the classical approximation. In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

But in that case, since the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta, their velocities are in opposite directions. But because the fragments have different masses, their speeds will be different.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out.

In the non-relativistic case, the momenta are p = m v and p = M v', where M is the mass of the other fragment.

Wait, no, each fragment has mass m1 and m2. So:

m1 v1 = m2 v2

Because their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Since m1 = 2 m2 (wait, no: wait the more massive fragment is 2 times the other. So m1 = 2 m2. Because if m is the smaller, then m1 is 2m, and m2 is m.

Wait, the problem says one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. So if the smaller is m, the larger is 2m.

So m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So (2m) v1 = m v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So v2 is twice as big as v1.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v².

So T1 (for m1) is (1/2) (2m) v1², and T2 is (1/2) m v2².

But since v2 = 2 v1, T1 = (1/2)(2m)(v1²) = m v1².

T2 = (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So T1 + T2 = 3 m v1² = 3 GeV.

Wait, so 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

T1 is m v1² = 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV. So in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Now, the actual relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher because of the relativistic effects.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation. So Δ = T1_rel - T1_class.

If the relativistic case leads to a higher T1, the difference would be positive.

So how do I compute T1 in the relativistic case?

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. But each fragment's energy is also related to their momentum and mass via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the lighter fragment, so the heavier has momentum p as well, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, because momentum is m v in non-relativistic, but relativistically, it's gamma m v.

So, for each fragment:

E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

Wait, no. Wait, the heavier fragment has mass 2m, so m1 = 2m, and m2 = m.

Wait, each fragment has momentum p and -p. So for the heavy fragment (mass 2m), momentum is p, so E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2m c²)^2 )

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

The total energy after fission is E1 + E2.

But the initial energy is 300 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

And the sum of rest masses is 3m c² = 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 = 2m c² * gamma1, and E2 = m c² * gamma2.

Alternatively, E1 = (2m c²) gamma1, E2 = (m c²) gamma2.

So,

(2m c²) gamma1 + (m c²) gamma2 = 300 GeV.

But also, the momentum p can be expressed in terms of each fragment's gamma.

p = gamma1 * m1 v1 = gamma1 * (2m) v1.

Similarly, p = gamma2 * m2 v2 = gamma2 * m v2.

But from momentum conservation, the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 (2m) v1 = gamma2 (m) v2.

Wait, but in the classical case, without considering gamma, we had v2 = 2 v1. But relativistically, this might not hold, as velocities would be different.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the total energy is 300 GeV, and the rest masses sum to 297 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But how to split that between the two fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is suggesting that the kinetic energy is low compared to rest mass, so relativistic effects are small, but the question is about the difference between relativistic and classical.

Wait, but wait, 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy. Let me check the rest masses.

The heavy fragment has rest energy 198 GeV, the light one has 99 GeV.

So 3 GeV is much less than their rest energies. So perhaps the kinetic energies are small compared to rest mass, so maybe non-relativistic approximation is a decent starting point, but the actual answer may differ by some MeV.

So to compute the correct T1 (relativistic), perhaps we can model it as follows:

Let p be the momentum of the heavier fragment (so the lighter has the same p magnitude but opposite direction). So the energies are:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2m c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

The sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

The sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) = 300 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But the problem is to find T1's correct value and compare to the classical approximation.

Wait, but in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV as earlier.

So perhaps I can model this and find T1.

But with the variables involved, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, since the kinetic energies are small compared to rest mass, perhaps we can use a Taylor expansion to approximate the relativistic kinetic energy.

The relativistic kinetic energy is T = (gamma - 1) m c².

In terms of momentum p, gamma is sqrt(1 + (p c / (m c^2))^2 )

So,

T ≈ ( (p c)/(2 m c^2) )^2 * m c²

Wait, perhaps for small p, because p is small compared to m c.

Wait, because the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and each fragment's rest mass is 198 and 99 GeV, so their kinetic energies are small.

So, let's approximate:

T = (p^2 c^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = p^2/(2 m).

Wait, but this is the classical expression. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, relativistic kinetic energy is:

T = (gamma - 1) m c².

For small velocities, gamma ≈ 1 + (p^2)/(2 m^2 c^2), because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) = 1 + (p^2 c²)/(2 m² c^4) ) = 1 + p²/(2 m² c²).

So,

T ≈ (p²)/(2 m c²) ) * m c² = p²/(2 m).

So for small p, the relativistic KE approximates to the classical KE.

But wait, in this case, the kinetic energies are 3 GeV in total, which is much less than rest mass, so perhaps the approximation holds.

But that would suggest that the classical and relativistic T1 would be the same, so the difference would be zero. But that's not one of the options; the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the two fragments have different masses, so their p expressions would differ, and the approximation is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make some substitutions.

Let me denote the momentum p as the same for both, but since their masses are different, their velocities are different.

But the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

In the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, perhaps each fragment's kinetic energy is a bit higher, because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but wait, T = (gamma -1) m c². So if the fragments are moving fast, their KE increases. But in this problem, the KE is 3 GeV, which is much less than their rest masses (hundreds of GeV), so maybe the velocities are low, and the gamma factors are close to 1.

But perhaps we can model the kinetic energies using the fact that the gamma factors are slightly larger than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider a frame where the heavier fragment is moving, and the other is moving in the opposite direction, but given that their momentum must be equal and opposite, I can express their velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me define variables:

Let m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

Each has momentum p and -p.

So,

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (2 m c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

The sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV, so E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + 3 GeV.

But how to solve for p?

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify.

Let me let x = p c.

So,

E1 = sqrt( x^2 + (2 m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( x^2 + (200 GeV)^2 ), because 2m is 198 GeV/c², but 2m c² is 198 GeV. Wait, wait, no, wait: the rest mass energy of m is 99 GeV (since m = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV). So m c² = 99 GeV, and 2m c² = 198 GeV.

So,

E1 = sqrt( x² + (198)^2 ) GeV,

E2 = sqrt( x² + (99)^2 ) GeV.

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

We can solve for x.

Let me denote A = 198, B = 99.

So,

sqrt(x² + A²) + sqrt(x² + B²) = 300.

But 300 is 3*A + 3*B = 3*(A + B) = 3*297= 891. No, that's not helpful. Wait, 300 is less than 297 + 3.

Wait, perhaps I can subtract 297 from each term.

Wait, 300 GeV is the sum of E1 + E2.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 + E2 = (A + B) + (T1 + T2) = 297 + 3 = 300. So that's correct.

So, let me write:

sqrt(x² + A²) = (E1) = 198 + (T1)

sqrt(x² + B²) = (E2) = 99 + (T2)

But T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But perhaps it's better to write:

sqrt(x² + 198²) = 198 + t1,

sqrt(x² + 99²) = 99 + t2,

where t1 + t2 = 3.

But maybe it's better to subtract.

Alternatively, let me square both sides.

Let me let S = sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

Let me denote sqrt(x² + 198²) = a,

and sqrt(x² + 99²) = b.

So a + b = 300.

We can square both sides:

a² + 2ab + b² = 90000.

But a² = x² + 198²,

b² = x² + 99².

So a² + b² = 2 x² + (198^2 + 99^2).

So,

2 x² + (198² +99²) + 2ab = 90000.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can find ab.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract the two expressions.

a = 300 - b.

Then,

a² = (300 - b)^2 = 90000 - 600 b + b².

But a² = x² + 198²,

b² = x² + 99².

Subtracting:

a² - b² = 198² -99².

Which is (a - b)(a + b) = (198 -99)(198 +99) )= 99 * 297 = 29403.

But a +b = 300,

so (a - b) * 300 = 29403.

So a - b = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01 GeV.

Wait, but a = sqrt(x² + 198²) = 198 + t1,

and b = sqrt(x² + 99²) = 99 + t2.

So a - b = (198 + t1) - (99 + t2) )= 99 + (t1 - t2).

But t1 + t2 = 3 GeV,

so a - b =99 + (t1 - t2).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, from earlier, a -b = 98.01 GeV.

So,

99 + (t1 - t2) =98.01 → (t1 - t2) = -0.99 GeV.

But t1 + t2 =3 GeV.

So,

t1 - t2 = -0.99,

t1 + t2 =3.

Adding the equations:

2 t1 = 2.01 → t1 =1.005 GeV.

t2= 3 - t1 =1.995 GeV.

So in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV.

In the classical approximation, T1 was 1 GeV.

So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is higher than the classical 1 GeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5 MeV. So the answer is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses such that one is twice the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. This leaves 3 GeV of energy to be distributed as kinetic energy between the two fragments.

### Step 1: Rest Masses of the Fragments
Let the smaller fragment have rest mass \( m \), and the larger fragment have rest mass \( 2m \). The total rest mass is \( m + 2m = 3m = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), so:

\[
m = 99 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 2m = 198 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy Conservation
The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The rest energy of the fragments is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \), so the total kinetic energy is:

\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta (\( p \) and \( -p \)) to conserve momentum. Using relativistic energy-momentum relations:

\[
E_1 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (2m c^2)^2}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}.
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Substituting \( E_1 = 198 + T_1 \) and \( E_2 = 99 + T_2 \), we solve for \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). The total kinetic energy is \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 4: Classical Approximation
In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). From momentum conservation, the velocities of the fragments are inversely proportional to their masses. Let the lighter fragment (mass \( m \)) have velocity \( v_2 \), and the heavier fragment (mass \( 2m \)) have velocity \( v_1 \). Then:

\[
m v_2 = 2m v_1 \implies v_2 = 2v_1.
\]

The kinetic energies are:

\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2m)v_1^2 = m v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2}m v_2^2 = 2m v_1^2.
\]

Since \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
m v_1^2 + 2m v_1^2 = 3m v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Relativistic Correction
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by:

\[
T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

For small velocities (since \( T \ll mc^2 \)), \( \gamma \approx 1 + \frac{p^2}{2m^2c^2} \). Using this approximation, the relativistic kinetic energy for the heavier fragment is slightly larger than the classical value. Solving numerically, the relativistic \( T_1 \) is found to be approximately \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 6: Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{rel}} - T_1^{\text{class}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is **5 MeV**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, just the two. The more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the other in terms of rest mass. Oh wait, the problem says one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. So if I let the smaller one be mass m, the larger would be 2m. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, does that mean M is 300 GeV/c²? Because rest mass energy is Mc², so 300 GeV would be the rest mass energy, so M = 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of initial M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M. That makes 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M each? No, wait, no. Let's compute correctly.

Wait, sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M? Wait no, no: the two fragments have masses m and 2m, so sum is 3m. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So the smaller fragment is 0.33 M and the larger is 0.66 M.

Wait, but then the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and the two fragments have rest masses m and 2m, sum 3m = 0.99 M. So M is 3m /0.99. So the initial mass is 3m /0.99. So the masses after fission are m = (0.99 M) /3 = 0.33 M, and 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c². So M = 300 GeV/c².

So the rest masses of the two fragments are m = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c², and 2m = 198 GeV/c². So each fragment has rest energies of 99 GeV and 198 GeV. Wait, but that seems way too high because the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. Oh wait, but the sum is 99 + 198 = 297 GeV, which is 99% of 300. So that's correct.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits into two fragments, they must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with some velocities.

The problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. It asks for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to compute T1 relativistic and T1_classical, then find T1 - T1_classical and see which option it matches.

Wait, but let's think about energy and momentum. The initial nucleus is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote them as p and -p.

The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. But the initial energy is just the rest energy of the nucleus, 300 GeV. So the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies of the two fragments must equal 300 GeV.

Wait, no! Wait, because in reality, when a nucleus undergoes fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. So the total rest mass after is less than before, hence the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

But in this problem, it says the sum of rest masses is 99%, so only 1% mass is converted to kinetic energy. So total energy after fission is sum of rest masses plus kinetic energies. But wait, the initial energy is all rest energy: 300 GeV.

So the equation would be:

Total energy after = sum(rest energies) + sum(KE) = 300 GeV.

Sum(rest energies) is 297 GeV, so sum(KE) is 3 GeV. Because 297 + 3 = 300.

So the two fragments have a combined kinetic energy of 3 GeV. So T1 (KE of the more massive fragment) plus T2 (KE of the less massive) equals 3 GeV.

But the question is about T1 and the relativistic vs. classical calculation.

Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is related to the speed, and since the fragments are moving, their kinetic energies can be calculated relativistically or non-relativistically.

But let me first consider the classical approximation. In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

But in that case, since the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta, their velocities are in opposite directions. But because the fragments have different masses, their speeds will be different.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out.

In the non-relativistic case, the momenta are p = m v and p = M v', where M is the mass of the other fragment.

Wait, no, each fragment has mass m1 and m2. So:

m1 v1 = m2 v2

Because their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Since m1 = 2 m2 (wait, no: wait the more massive fragment is 2 times the other. So m1 = 2 m2. Because if m is the smaller, then m1 is 2m, and m2 is m.

Wait, the problem says one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. So if the smaller is m, the larger is 2m.

So m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So (2m) v1 = m v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So v2 is twice as big as v1.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v².

So T1 (for m1) is (1/2) (2m) v1², and T2 is (1/2) m v2².

But since v2 = 2 v1, T1 = (1/2)(2m)(v1²) = m v1².

T2 = (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So T1 + T2 = 3 m v1² = 3 GeV.

Wait, so 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

T1 is m v1² = 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV. So in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Now, the actual relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher because of the relativistic effects.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation. So Δ = T1_rel - T1_class.

If the relativistic case leads to a higher T1, the difference would be positive.

So how do I compute T1 in the relativistic case?

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. But each fragment's energy is also related to their momentum and mass via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the lighter fragment, so the heavier has momentum p as well, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, because momentum is m v in non-relativistic, but relativistically, it's gamma m v.

So, for each fragment:

E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

Wait, no. Wait, the heavier fragment has mass 2m, so m1 = 2m, and m2 = m.

Wait, each fragment has momentum p and -p. So for the heavy fragment (mass 2m), momentum is p, so E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2m c²)^2 )

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

The total energy after fission is E1 + E2.

But the initial energy is 300 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

And the sum of rest masses is 3m c² = 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 = 2m c² * gamma1, and E2 = m c² * gamma2.

Alternatively, E1 = (2m c²) gamma1, E2 = (m c²) gamma2.

So,

(2m c²) gamma1 + (m c²) gamma2 = 300 GeV.

But also, the momentum p can be expressed in terms of each fragment's gamma.

p = gamma1 * m1 v1 = gamma1 * (2m) v1.

Similarly, p = gamma2 * m2 v2 = gamma2 * m v2.

But from momentum conservation, the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 (2m) v1 = gamma2 (m) v2.

Wait, but in the classical case, without considering gamma, we had v2 = 2 v1. But relativistically, this might not hold, as velocities would be different.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the total energy is 300 GeV, and the rest masses sum to 297 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But how to split that between the two fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is suggesting that the kinetic energy is low compared to rest mass, so relativistic effects are small, but the question is about the difference between relativistic and classical.

Wait, but wait, 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy. Let me check the rest masses.

The heavy fragment has rest energy 198 GeV, the light one has 99 GeV.

So 3 GeV is much less than their rest energies. So perhaps the kinetic energies are small compared to rest mass, so maybe non-relativistic approximation is a decent starting point, but the actual answer may differ by some MeV.

So to compute the correct T1 (relativistic), perhaps we can model it as follows:

Let p be the momentum of the heavier fragment (so the lighter has the same p magnitude but opposite direction). So the energies are:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (2m c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

The sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

The sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) = 300 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But the problem is to find T1's correct value and compare to the classical approximation.

Wait, but in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV as earlier.

So perhaps I can model this and find T1.

But with the variables involved, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, since the kinetic energies are small compared to rest mass, perhaps we can use a Taylor expansion to approximate the relativistic kinetic energy.

The relativistic kinetic energy is T = (gamma - 1) m c².

In terms of momentum p, gamma is sqrt(1 + (p c / (m c^2))^2 )

So,

T ≈ ( (p c)/(2 m c^2) )^2 * m c²

Wait, perhaps for small p, because p is small compared to m c.

Wait, because the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and each fragment's rest mass is 198 and 99 GeV, so their kinetic energies are small.

So, let's approximate:

T = (p^2 c^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = p^2/(2 m).

Wait, but this is the classical expression. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, relativistic kinetic energy is:

T = (gamma - 1) m c².

For small velocities, gamma ≈ 1 + (p^2)/(2 m^2 c^2), because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) = 1 + (p^2 c²)/(2 m² c^4) ) = 1 + p²/(2 m² c²).

So,

T ≈ (p²)/(2 m c²) ) * m c² = p²/(2 m).

So for small p, the relativistic KE approximates to the classical KE.

But wait, in this case, the kinetic energies are 3 GeV in total, which is much less than rest mass, so perhaps the approximation holds.

But that would suggest that the classical and relativistic T1 would be the same, so the difference would be zero. But that's not one of the options; the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the two fragments have different masses, so their p expressions would differ, and the approximation is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make some substitutions.

Let me denote the momentum p as the same for both, but since their masses are different, their velocities are different.

But the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

In the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, perhaps each fragment's kinetic energy is a bit higher, because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but wait, T = (gamma -1) m c². So if the fragments are moving fast, their KE increases. But in this problem, the KE is 3 GeV, which is much less than their rest masses (hundreds of GeV), so maybe the velocities are low, and the gamma factors are close to 1.

But perhaps we can model the kinetic energies using the fact that the gamma factors are slightly larger than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider a frame where the heavier fragment is moving, and the other is moving in the opposite direction, but given that their momentum must be equal and opposite, I can express their velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me define variables:

Let m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

Each has momentum p and -p.

So,

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (2 m c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

The sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV, so E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + 3 GeV.

But how to solve for p?

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify.

Let me let x = p c.

So,

E1 = sqrt( x^2 + (2 m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( x^2 + (200 GeV)^2 ), because 2m is 198 GeV/c², but 2m c² is 198 GeV. Wait, wait, no, wait: the rest mass energy of m is 99 GeV (since m = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV). So m c² = 99 GeV, and 2m c² = 198 GeV.

So,

E1 = sqrt( x² + (198)^2 ) GeV,

E2 = sqrt( x² + (99)^2 ) GeV.

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

We can solve for x.

Let me denote A = 198, B = 99.

So,

sqrt(x² + A²) + sqrt(x² + B²) = 300.

But 300 is 3*A + 3*B = 3*(A + B) = 3*297= 891. No, that's not helpful. Wait, 300 is less than 297 + 3.

Wait, perhaps I can subtract 297 from each term.

Wait, 300 GeV is the sum of E1 + E2.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 + E2 = (A + B) + (T1 + T2) = 297 + 3 = 300. So that's correct.

So, let me write:

sqrt(x² + A²) = (E1) = 198 + (T1)

sqrt(x² + B²) = (E2) = 99 + (T2)

But T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But perhaps it's better to write:

sqrt(x² + 198²) = 198 + t1,

sqrt(x² + 99²) = 99 + t2,

where t1 + t2 = 3.

But maybe it's better to subtract.

Alternatively, let me square both sides.

Let me let S = sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

Let me denote sqrt(x² + 198²) = a,

and sqrt(x² + 99²) = b.

So a + b = 300.

We can square both sides:

a² + 2ab + b² = 90000.

But a² = x² + 198²,

b² = x² + 99².

So a² + b² = 2 x² + (198^2 + 99^2).

So,

2 x² + (198² +99²) + 2ab = 90000.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can find ab.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract the two expressions.

a = 300 - b.

Then,

a² = (300 - b)^2 = 90000 - 600 b + b².

But a² = x² + 198²,

b² = x² + 99².

Subtracting:

a² - b² = 198² -99².

Which is (a - b)(a + b) = (198 -99)(198 +99) )= 99 * 297 = 29403.

But a +b = 300,

so (a - b) * 300 = 29403.

So a - b = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01 GeV.

Wait, but a = sqrt(x² + 198²) = 198 + t1,

and b = sqrt(x² + 99²) = 99 + t2.

So a - b = (198 + t1) - (99 + t2) )= 99 + (t1 - t2).

But t1 + t2 = 3 GeV,

so a - b =99 + (t1 - t2).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, from earlier, a -b = 98.01 GeV.

So,

99 + (t1 - t2) =98.01 → (t1 - t2) = -0.99 GeV.

But t1 + t2 =3 GeV.

So,

t1 - t2 = -0.99,

t1 + t2 =3.

Adding the equations:

2 t1 = 2.01 → t1 =1.005 GeV.

t2= 3 - t1 =1.995 GeV.

So in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV.

In the classical approximation, T1 was 1 GeV.

So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is higher than the classical 1 GeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5 MeV. So the answer is B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses such that one is twice the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV. This leaves 3 GeV of energy to be distributed as kinetic energy between the two fragments.

### Step 1: Rest Masses of the Fragments
Let the smaller fragment have rest mass \( m \), and the larger fragment have rest mass \( 2m \). The total rest mass is \( m + 2m = 3m = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), so:

\[
m = 99 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 2m = 198 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy Conservation
The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The rest energy of the fragments is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \), so the total kinetic energy is:

\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta (\( p \) and \( -p \)) to conserve momentum. Using relativistic energy-momentum relations:

\[
E_1 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (2m c^2)^2}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}.
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Substituting \( E_1 = 198 + T_1 \) and \( E_2 = 99 + T_2 \), we solve for \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). The total kinetic energy is \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 4: Classical Approximation
In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). From momentum conservation, the velocities of the fragments are inversely proportional to their masses. Let the lighter fragment (mass \( m \)) have velocity \( v_2 \), and the heavier fragment (mass \( 2m \)) have velocity \( v_1 \). Then:

\[
m v_2 = 2m v_1 \implies v_2 = 2v_1.
\]

The kinetic energies are:

\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2m)v_1^2 = m v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2}m v_2^2 = 2m v_1^2.
\]

Since \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
m v_1^2 + 2m v_1^2 = 3m v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Relativistic Correction
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by:

\[
T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

For small velocities (since \( T \ll mc^2 \)), \( \gamma \approx 1 + \frac{p^2}{2m^2c^2} \). Using this approximation, the relativistic kinetic energy for the heavier fragment is slightly larger than the classical value. Solving numerically, the relativistic \( T_1 \) is found to be approximately \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 6: Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{rel}} - T_1^{\text{class}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is **5 MeV**.
