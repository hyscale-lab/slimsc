Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the setup is that we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given by this expression: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. And when they measured the particles' positions, they only found them between x=1 and x=3. So, the question is to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding a particle in a region is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.

Oh, wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. The modulus squared would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because for a complex number (x + iy), the modulus squared is x² + y². So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, if the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, that probably means that the wave function must be zero outside this region. But looking at our wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for this to be zero, both terms must be zero. The first term, a/sqrt(1+x), would be zero only if a is zero. But that can't be right because then the wave function would everywhere be -0.5i, which would give a |ψ|^2 of 0.25, a constant, which would imply the particle is equally likely to be found anywhere. But the measurements show it's only between 1 and 3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is zero outside the interval 1 to 3. That is, ψ(x) = 0 for x <1 and x>3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So maybe that's the expression for ψ(x) only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but the problem says that each particle's wave function is described by that expression in the region where it can exist. So, perhaps the given expression is valid only in the region between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So, ψ(x) is zero outside that interval.

But then, when considering normalization, the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity must equal 1. So, in this case, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be 1. Because elsewhere ψ is zero.

So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))² + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

So, let me compute that. Let's expand the integral.

First, (a²)/(1+x) for the first term, and 0.25 for the second term. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts: a² ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), and the particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). This implies that the wave function is zero outside this interval. The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \).

For the first integral, \( \int \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

For the second integral:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.
