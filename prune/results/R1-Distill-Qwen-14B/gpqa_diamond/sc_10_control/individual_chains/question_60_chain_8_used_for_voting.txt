Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how old they'll be when they reach Earth from their own perspective.

Wait, the question says, "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth." Oh, okay, so we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame.

But wait, I think I need to calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame and then apply the time dilation effect. Or is it the other way around? No, no, time dilation depends on the frame. If the astronaut is moving relative to Earth, their time will be dilated from Earth's perspective, but from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The problem asks for the time experienced by the astronaut, which is their proper time. So the proper time tau is related to the coordinate time t (from Earth's frame) by the Lorentz factor gamma.

The formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to find tau, which is the astronaut's experienced time.

But first, I need to find the time t it takes from Earth's perspective. The distance to Earth is the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but do I know that distance? Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give any distance. Hmm, maybe I don't need it because the options are given in years, so perhaps the distance is considered such that the time from Earth's frame is a certain number of years, and then we apply the time dilation.

Wait, but the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, so if the trip takes longer than about 130 years from Earth's frame, then the astronaut wouldn't survive. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old. So from the astronaut's perspective, how old would they be when they reach Earth. So their experienced time is tau, which is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the first step is to find t, the time it takes to reach Earth from Earth's frame. But wait, how far away is the Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud? Oh, I think the problem doesn't give that, so maybe I'm supposed to assume that the distance is given in terms of light years? Or maybe the speed is given as a fraction of c, so perhaps the time is distance divided by speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is their own proper time. So perhaps the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, and the distance is D. So from Earth's frame, the time t is D/(0.99999987c). Then tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Alternatively, since v is very close to c, perhaps the Lorentz factor gamma is approximately 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as 1/(sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)).

Wait, v is 0.99999987c. So (v/c) is 0.99999987. Let me compute (v/c)^2: that's approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let's calculate that.

0.99999987 squared: Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Hmm, 1 - 2*(1 - 0.99999987) = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974. Wait, no, that's the approximation for (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So x here is 0.00000013, since 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 0.99999974.

Wait, but wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (v/c)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987^2) ≈ 2.6e-7.

So the square root of this is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ around 5e-4, because (5e-4)^2 is 25e-8 = 2.5e-7, which is close to 2.6e-7.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ≈ 1/(5e-4) = 2000. So gamma is approximately 2000.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute v/c = 0.99999987.

So v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2. Let me compute 0.99999987^2 accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013.

So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². Since x is 0.00000013, x squared is 1.69e-14, which is negligible compared to the other terms.

So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00000013 = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Then sqrt(0.00000026) is, well, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.5e-7) is about 5e-4, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):

Well, 2.6e-7 is 26e-8. The square root of 25e-8 is 5e-4 (since (5e-4)^2 =25e-8=2.5e-7). So sqrt(26e-8)= a bit more than 5e-4.

Let me compute 5.1e-4 squared: (5.1e-4)^2 = (5.1)^2 × 1e-8 = 26.01 × 1e-8= 2.601e-7. Oh, that's exactly what we have. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.1e-4, because (5.1e-4)^2=2.601e-7.

So gamma = 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So gamma is approximately 1960.8.

Wait, so gamma is about 2000, but more accurately about 1960.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = t * (5.1e-4).

But wait, no, tau is t divided by gamma. Because tau = t / gamma.

Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = t * (1/gamma). Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/gamma.

So tau = t / gamma.

But first, we need to find t, the time from Earth's frame.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to assume that the distance is such that the time from Earth's perspective is a particular value. But without that, I can't compute t. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the average lifetime of the aliens, which is 150 years. Wait, the astronaut is 22, so if the trip takes longer than 150 years in Earth's frame, the astronaut would not survive. But the options don't all suggest that. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the time from Earth's frame is D/(0.99999987c), but without knowing D, perhaps the problem expects me to use another approach.

Wait, perhaps the distance is the same as the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth, which is about 160,000 light-years. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check: the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years from the Milky Way, but wait, Earth is in the Milky Way, and the LMC is a satellite galaxy. So perhaps the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 ly.

If that's the case, then the time from Earth's frame is distance divided by speed: t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so t ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Let's compute that.

Wait, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, because (1 - x)^-1 ≈ 1 + x for small x. Here, x is 0.00000013. So 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 = 1.00000013.

So t ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013.

160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = (160,000 * 1.3) * 1e-7 = 208,000e-7 = 20.8e-3 = 0.0208 years. So t ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,020.0208 years.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.0208 years is about a week and a half. So t ≈ 160,020 years.

Wait, that's a really long time. But from the astronaut's perspective, their experienced time is tau = t / gamma.

Gamma is about 1960. So tau ≈ 160,020 / 1960 ≈ approximately 81.5 years.

Wait, 1960 * 81 = 159, 1960*80=156,800. 1960 * 81=156,800 +1960=158,760. 1960*81.5=158,760 + 980=159,740. Still less than 160,020. So 81.5 would give around 159,740, so 160,020 would be about 81.63.

So 81.63 years is the proper time, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 ≈ 103.6 years. Wait, but the options don't provide this number. Wait, the options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, but from the calculation, the astronaut's experienced time is about 81.6 years. So option C is 81 years. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance. If the distance is 160,000 light years, then t is about 160,000 years. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so from Earth's frame, the astronaut would take 160,000 years to reach Earth, which is way beyond their lifespan. So they would die before arrival, so option A.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation. Hmm, now I'm confused.

No, wait, the proper time tau is about 81 years, so the astronaut would experience 81 years. So 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than the average lifespan of 150, so they would survive. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

But wait, I thought the time from Earth's frame was 160,000 years. That's a problem because that would mean the astronaut's experienced time is 81 years, but that's only if the trip takes 81 years in their own frame, but from Earth's frame it's 160,000 years. But the astronaut is moving, so Earth time is much longer.

Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 81 years from the astronaut's perspective, they would reach Earth at 22+81=103, which is fine. But from Earth's perspective, the trip takes 160,000 years, but the astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, so from Earth's frame, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth, but from their own frame, they'd reach.

Wait, that's a paradox. So which perspective is the correct one?

Wait, the problem is from the astronaut's perspective. The question is, how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth. So the answer is 81 years, so option C. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so 81 is less than 150, so they would survive.

But wait, when considering time from Earth's frame, it's 160,000 years, which is way beyond the astronaut's lifespan. So from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would die before reaching, but from the astronaut's perspective, they would live longer.

But the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective, so the experienced time is 81 years. So the astronaut would be 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their lifespan of 150 years. So the answer would be C, 81 years.

But wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

If v = 0.99999987c, then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.8.

The distance from LMC to Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. So time from Earth's frame, t = distance/speed.

t = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,020.02 years.

Then, tau = t / gamma ≈ 160,020 / 1960.8 ≈ approximately 81.5 years.

So, astronaut's experienced time is about 81.5 years. So option C is 81, which is the closest.

So the astronaut's age upon arrival is 22 + 81.5 = 103.5 years, which is less than the 150-year average lifespan. So they'd reach Earth alive, and the answer is 81 years (option C).

But wait, another thing: if the speed is 0.99999987c, then the gamma factor is high, so the time experienced is much shorter than the Earth frame time. So the astronaut would live 81 years, Earth would see the trip taking 160,000 years. But the astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, which is longer than 81, so they would survive.

So the correct answer is C, 81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut, denoted as \( \tau \), using the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of relativity:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The spacecraft travels at \( v = 0.99999987c \). First, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Then, calculate \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Next, compute \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \approx \frac{1}{5.1 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960.8.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( t \) (time from Earth's frame)
The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately \( 160,000 \) light-years. The time \( t \) it takes to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{ly} = 1 \, \text{year} \) at the speed of light, we approximate:

\[
t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,020 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \) (time from the astronaut's frame)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \approx \frac{160,020}{1960.8} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the astronaut's lifespan
The astronaut is initially 22 years old, so their age upon arrival would be:

\[
22 + 81.5 = 103.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

The average lifespan of these aliens is 150 years, so the astronaut would survive the journey.

### Step 5: Evaluate the options
- **Option A:** "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth" is incorrect because the astronaut's experienced time is 81.5 years, which is less than their lifespan.
- **Option B:** 72 years is too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \approx 81.5 \, \text{years} \).
- **Option C:** 81 years is the closest to the calculated \( \tau \approx 81.5 \, \text{years} \).
- **Option D:** 77 years is also too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \).

### Final Answer:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey, making **Option C** the correct choice.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs.

Or maybe the speed is given as a fraction of c, so perhaps the time is distance divided by speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is their own proper time. So perhaps the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, and the distance is D. So from Earth's frame, the time t is D/(0.99999987c). Then tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Alternatively, since v is very close to c, perhaps the Lorentz factor gamma is approximately 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as 1/(sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)).

Wait, v is 0.99999987c. So (v/c) is 0.99999987. Let me compute (v/c)^2: that's approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let's calculate that.

0.99999987 squared: Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Hmm, 1 - 2*(1 - 0.99999987) = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974. Wait, no, that's the approximation for (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So x here is 0.00000013, since 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 0.99999974.

Wait, but wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (v/c)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987^2) ≈ 2.6e-7.

So the square root of this is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ around 5e-4, because (5e-4)^2 is 25e-8 = 2.5e-7, which is close to 2.6e-7.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ≈ 1/(5e-4) = 2000. So gamma is approximately 2000.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute v/c = 0.99999987.

So v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2. Let me compute 0.99999987^2 accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013.

So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². Since x is 0.00000013, x squared is 1.69e-14, which is negligible compared to the other terms.

So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00000013 = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Then sqrt(0.00000026) is, well, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.5e-7) is about 5e-4, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):

Well, 2.6e-7 is 26e-8. The square root of 25e-8 is 5e-4 (since (5e-4)^2 =25e-8=2.5e-7). So sqrt(26e-8)= a bit more than 5e-4.

Let me compute 5.1e-4 squared: (5.1e-4)^2 = (5.1)^2 × 1e-8 = 26.01 × 1e-8= 2.601e-7. Oh, that's exactly what we have. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.1e-4, because (5.1e-4)^2=2.601e-7.

So gamma = 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So gamma is approximately 1960.8.

Wait, so gamma is about 2000, but more accurately about 1960.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = t * (5.1e-4).

But wait, no, tau is t divided by gamma. Because tau = t / gamma.

Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = t * (1/gamma). Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/gamma.

So tau = t / gamma.

But first, we need to find t, the time from Earth's frame.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to assume that the distance is such that the time from Earth's perspective is a particular value. But without that, I can't compute t. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the average lifetime of the aliens, which is 150 years. Wait, the astronaut is 22, so if the trip takes longer than 150 years in Earth's frame, the astronaut would not survive. But the options don't all suggest that. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the time from Earth's frame is D/(0.99999987c), but without knowing D, perhaps the problem expects me to use another approach.

Wait, perhaps the distance is the same as the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth, which is about 160,000 light-years. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check: the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years from the Milky Way, but wait, Earth is in the Milky Way, and the LMC is a satellite galaxy. So perhaps the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 ly.

If that's the case, then the time from Earth's frame is distance divided by speed: t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so t ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Let's compute that.

Wait, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, because (1 - x)^-1 ≈ 1 + x for small x. Here, x is 0.00000013. So 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 = 1.00000013.

So t ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013.

160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = (160,000 * 1.3) * 1e-7 = 208,000e-7 = 20.8e-3 = 0.0208 years. So t ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,020.0208 years.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.0208 years is about a week and a half. So t ≈ 160,020 years.

Wait, that's a really long time. But from the astronaut's perspective, their experienced time is tau = t / gamma.

Gamma is about 1960. So tau ≈ 160,020 / 1960 ≈ approximately 81.5 years.

Wait, 1960 * 81 = 159, 1960*80=156,800. 1960 * 81=156,800 +1960=158,760. 1960*81.5=158,760 + 980=159,740. Still less than 160,020. So 81.5 would give around 159,740, so 160,020 would be about 81.63.

So 81.63 years is the proper time, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 ≈ 103.6 years. Wait, but the options don't provide this number. Wait, the options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, but from the calculation, the astronaut's experienced time is about 81.6 years. So option C is 81 years. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance. If the distance is 160,000 light years, then t is about 160,000 years. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so from Earth's frame, the astronaut would take 160,000 years to reach Earth, which is way beyond their lifespan. So they would die before arrival, so option A.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation. Hmm, now I'm confused.

No, wait, the proper time tau is about 81 years, so the astronaut would experience 81 years. So 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than the average lifespan of 150, so they would survive. So the answer is option C, 81 years.

But wait, I thought the time from Earth's frame was 160,000 years. That's a problem because that would mean the astronaut's experienced time is 81 years, but that's only if the trip takes 81 years in their own frame, but from Earth's frame it's 160,000 years. But the astronaut is moving, so Earth time is much longer.

Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 81 years from the astronaut's perspective, they would reach Earth at 22+81=103, which is fine. But from Earth's perspective, the trip takes 160,000 years, but the astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, so from Earth's frame, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth, but from their own frame, they'd reach.

Wait, that's a paradox. So which perspective is the correct one?

Wait, the problem is from the astronaut's perspective. The question is, how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth. So the answer is 81 years, so option C. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so 81 is less than 150, so they would survive.

But wait, when considering time from Earth's frame, it's 160,000 years, which is way beyond the astronaut's lifespan. So from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would die before reaching, but from the astronaut's perspective, they would live longer.

But the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective, so the experienced time is 81 years. So the astronaut would be 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their lifespan of 150 years. So the answer would be C, 81 years.

But wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

If v = 0.99999987c, then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.8.

The distance from LMC to Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. So time from Earth's frame, t = distance/speed.

t = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,020.02 years.

Then, tau = t / gamma ≈ 160,020 / 1960.8 ≈ approximately 81.5 years.

So, astronaut's experienced time is about 81.5 years. So option C is 81, which is the closest.

So the astronaut's age upon arrival is 22 + 81.5 = 103.5 years, which is less than the 150-year average lifespan. So they'd reach Earth alive, and the answer is 81 years (option C).

But wait, another thing: if the speed is 0.99999987c, then the gamma factor is high, so the time experienced is much shorter than the Earth frame time. So the astronaut would live 81 years, Earth would see the trip taking 160,000 years. But the astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, which is longer than 81, so they would survive.

So the correct answer is C, 81 years.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut, denoted as \( \tau \), using the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of relativity:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The spacecraft travels at \( v = 0.99999987c \). First, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Then, calculate \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Next, compute \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \approx \frac{1}{5.1 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960.8.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( t \) (time from Earth's frame)
The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately \( 160,000 \) light-years. The time \( t \) it takes to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{ly} = 1 \, \text{year} \) at the speed of light, we approximate:

\[
t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,020 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \) (time from the astronaut's frame)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \approx \frac{160,020}{1960.8} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the astronaut's lifespan
The astronaut is initially 22 years old, so their age upon arrival would be:

\[
22 + 81.5 = 103.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

The average lifespan of these aliens is 150 years, so the astronaut would survive the journey.

### Step 5: Evaluate the options
- **Option A:** "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth" is incorrect because the astronaut's experienced time is 81.5 years, which is less than their lifespan.
- **Option B:** 72 years is too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \approx 81.5 \, \text{years} \).
- **Option C:** 81 years is the closest to the calculated \( \tau \approx 81.5 \, \text{years} \).
- **Option D:** 77 years is also too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \).

### Final Answer:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey, making **Option C** the correct choice.
