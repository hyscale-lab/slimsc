Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I need to find at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process.

The problem says that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. So, I need to figure out the energy of the gamma-rays that would make their lifetime in the universe limited by this annihilation process.

Wait, I think this has to do with the photon-photon interaction. When a high-energy gamma-ray (gamma1) interacts with a low-energy CMB photon (gamma2), they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. But photons are bosons, so maybe it's more about the cross-section and the density of the CMB.

I remember that the cross-section for this process has a certain dependence on the energy. At high energies, the cross-section might be inversely proportional to some power of the energy. But wait, the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is a specific calculation. Oh right, the cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair increases with the square of the center-of-mass energy, but only up to a certain threshold. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the threshold condition.

The threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. So, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So, each photon has to have enough energy in the center-of-mass frame. But wait, in this case, one photon is high-energy (gamma-ray) and the other is low-energy (CMB). So, the threshold condition must be met in their combined system.

Let me think about the center-of-mass energy. The CMB photon has energy E2 = 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray photon has energy E1. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but wait, photons are massless, so their momentum is E/(c). But since they're moving in opposite directions in the lab frame (like head-on), the momentum vectors would subtract. Wait, no, if the gamma-ray is moving in one direction and the CMB photon is moving in the opposite, then their momenta would add in the opposite direction.

Wait, let me correct that. The two photons are moving in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me denote the energy and momentum of each photon.

Gamma-ray photon: energy E1, momentum p1 = E1/c in +x direction.

CMB photon: energy E2, momentum p2 = E2/c in -x direction.

So the total energy is E1 + E2.

The total momentum is p1 - p2 (since p2 is in opposite direction), which is (E1/c) - (-E2/c) = (E1 + E2)/c.

Wait, no, wait: if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is in the -x direction, so p2 = -E2/(c) in the lab frame where the gamma is moving forward.

So the total energy is E1 + E2, total momentum is (E1/c - E2/c) in the +x direction.

The invariant s squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

So s^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2.

Wait, let me compute that:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2

Expanding this,

s = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2]

Simplify:

s = (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 - E2^2

The E1^2 and E2^2 terms cancel out.

s = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

The threshold condition for producing an electron-positron pair is that the sqrt(s) must be at least 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2.

Simplify sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2.

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2.

Square both sides:

E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

We know E2 is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Compute m_e c^2: that's the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

Then, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

Calculate 0.511^2: approximately 0.261.

So E1 ≈ 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 GeV, but wait, no.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e15 eV is 1e6 GeV.

Wait, let me double-check the unit conversions.

Wait, E1 is in eV, right? Because E2 is 1e-3 eV, so the units would be eV.

So E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

Which is 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

But 1e9 eV is 1 GeV.

So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, because 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV; 1e14 / 1e9 = 1e5).

So 2.61e5 GeV is 2.61 * 1e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. The calculation assumes that the gamma-ray photon's energy is such that E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

That gives the threshold condition for pair production. But the question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this annihilation process. I think this is about the photon's mean free path. If the cross-section is such that the photon is likely to annihilate quickly, its lifetime is limited by that process.

But in the calculation, I found the threshold energy. So any gamma-ray above this energy would have a non-zero probability of annihilating with CMB photons. But perhaps the problem is when the photon's lifetime due to this process becomes comparable to the age of the universe.

Wait, the mean lifetime of a photon at a certain energy is given by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the cross-section and the number density of CMB photons.

But the cross-section for pair production increases with energy. So when the photon's energy is high, the cross-section is large, leading to a shorter mean free path and hence a shorter lifetime.

So the energy where the photon's lifetime is limited (i.e., becomes comparable to the age of the universe) is when the photon's lifetime due to this process is about the same as the age of the universe.

But perhaps the question is more straightforward. It's asking from what energy would the annihilation process limit the gamma-ray's lifetime. So the threshold energy is the key point. Because below this energy, the cross-section is too small, so the photon doesn't annihilate. Once above this, annihilation becomes possible, so the photon can't live as long as it would otherwise.

Wait, but wait: in our earlier calculation, we found that E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Which gives E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * (1e12) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So 2.6e5 GeV is option C.

But wait, the options are in the order of 1e4 to 1e5 GeV. Wait, let me look again:

Options:

A) 9.5*1e4 GeV → 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5*10^4 GeV = 9.5e4 GeV.

B) 1.8e5 GeV → 1.8*1e5 GeV.

C) 2.6e5 GeV.

D) 3.9e5 GeV.

So according to our calculation, 2.6e5 GeV is option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV².

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3.

Compute numerator: 0.511^2 = 0.261. So 0.261 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261e12.

Divide by 1e-3: (0.261e12) / (1e-3) ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C) 2.6*1e5 GeV.

To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The annihilation threshold is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$.

The invariant center-of-mass energy squared is given by:

\[
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (p_1 c - p_2 c)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are their momenta. For photons, $p = E/c$, and if the photons are moving head-on, the total momentum is $p_1 - p_2$. Simplifying, the invariant $s$ becomes:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2.
\]

At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
4E_1E_2 = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Solving for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511)^2 \approx 0.261$, so:

\[
E_1 = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Matches the calculation.
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too high.

The correct answer is **C**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I need to find at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process.

The problem says that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. So, I need to figure out the energy of the gamma-rays that would make their lifetime in the universe limited by this annihilation process.

Wait, I think this has to do with the photon-photon interaction. When a high-energy gamma-ray (gamma1) interacts with a low-energy CMB photon (gamma2), they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. But photons are bosons, so maybe it's more about the cross-section and the density of the CMB.

I remember that the cross-section for this process has a certain dependence on the energy. At high energies, the cross-section might be inversely proportional to some power of the energy. But wait, the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is a specific calculation. Oh right, the cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair increases with the square of the center-of-mass energy, but only up to a certain threshold. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the threshold condition.

The threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. So, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So, each photon has to have enough energy in the center-of-mass frame. But wait, in this case, one photon is high-energy (gamma-ray) and the other is low-energy (CMB). So, the threshold condition must be met in their combined system.

Let me think about the center-of-mass energy. The CMB photon has energy E2 = 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray photon has energy E1. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but wait, photons are massless, so their momentum is E/(c). But since they're moving in opposite directions in the lab frame (like head-on), the momentum vectors would subtract. Wait, no, if the gamma-ray is moving in one direction and the CMB photon is moving in the opposite, then their momenta would add in the opposite direction.

Wait, let me correct that. The two photons are moving in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me denote the energy and momentum of each photon.

Gamma-ray photon: energy E1, momentum p1 = E1/c in +x direction.

CMB photon: energy E2, momentum p2 = E2/c in -x direction.

So the total energy is E1 + E2.

The total momentum is p1 - p2 (since p2 is in opposite direction), which is (E1/c) - (-E2/c) = (E1 + E2)/c.

Wait, no, wait: if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is in the -x direction, so p2 = -E2/(c) in the lab frame where the gamma is moving forward.

So the total energy is E1 + E2, total momentum is (E1/c - E2/c) in the +x direction.

The invariant s squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

So s^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2.

Wait, let me compute that:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2

Expanding this,

s = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2]

Simplify:

s = (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 - E2^2

The E1^2 and E2^2 terms cancel out.

s = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

The threshold condition for producing an electron-positron pair is that the sqrt(s) must be at least 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2.

Simplify sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2.

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2.

Square both sides:

E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

We know E2 is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Compute m_e c^2: that's the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

Then, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

Calculate 0.511^2: approximately 0.261.

So E1 ≈ 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 GeV, but wait, no.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e15 eV is 1e6 GeV.

Wait, let me double-check the unit conversions.

Wait, E1 is in eV, right? Because E2 is 1e-3 eV, so the units would be eV.

So E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

Which is 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

But 1e9 eV is 1 GeV.

So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, because 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV; 1e14 / 1e9 = 1e5).

So 2.61e5 GeV is 2.61 * 1e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. The calculation assumes that the gamma-ray photon's energy is such that E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

That gives the threshold condition for pair production. But the question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this annihilation process. I think this is about the photon's mean free path. If the cross-section is such that the photon is likely to annihilate quickly, its lifetime is limited by that process.

But in the calculation, I found the threshold energy. So any gamma-ray above this energy would have a non-zero probability of annihilating with CMB photons. But perhaps the problem is when the photon's lifetime due to this process becomes comparable to the age of the universe.

Wait, the mean lifetime of a photon at a certain energy is given by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the cross-section and the number density of CMB photons.

But the cross-section for pair production increases with energy. So when the photon's energy is high, the cross-section is large, leading to a shorter mean free path and hence a shorter lifetime.

So the energy where the photon's lifetime is limited (i.e., becomes comparable to the age of the universe) is when the photon's lifetime due to this process is about the same as the age of the universe.

But perhaps the question is more straightforward. It's asking from what energy would the annihilation process limit the gamma-ray's lifetime. So the threshold energy is the key point. Because below this energy, the cross-section is too small, so the photon doesn't annihilate. Once above this, annihilation becomes possible, so the photon can't live as long as it would otherwise.

Wait, but wait: in our earlier calculation, we found that E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Which gives E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * (1e12) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So 2.6e5 GeV is option C.

But wait, the options are in the order of 1e4 to 1e5 GeV. Wait, let me look again:

Options:

A) 9.5*1e4 GeV → 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5*10^4 GeV = 9.5e4 GeV.

B) 1.8e5 GeV → 1.8*1e5 GeV.

C) 2.6e5 GeV.

D) 3.9e5 GeV.

So according to our calculation, 2.6e5 GeV is option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV².

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3.

Compute numerator: 0.511^2 = 0.261. So 0.261 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261e12.

Divide by 1e-3: (0.261e12) / (1e-3) ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C) 2.6*1e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The annihilation threshold is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$.

The invariant center-of-mass energy squared is given by:

\[
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (p_1 c - p_2 c)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are their momenta. For photons, $p = E/c$, and if the photons are moving head-on, the total momentum is $p_1 - p_2$. Simplifying, the invariant $s$ becomes:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2.
\]

At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
4E_1E_2 = (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Solving for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511)^2 \approx 0.261$, so:

\[
E_1 = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **B)** $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too low.
- **C)** $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Matches the calculation.
- **D)** $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ — Too high.

The correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
