Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh, wait, actually, no, I think I read that wrong. It says it's a column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. So the state vector is [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Then there's an observable represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So I should probably write that out to visualize it better.

Wait, let me write the matrix P explicitly. So P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], the second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], and the third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2      0    ]

Wait, no—did I get that right? Because the second row has elements (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), so yes.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t.

Hmm. So in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So the first step is probably to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, the observable is represented by the operator P, and the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So when we measure P, we get an eigenvalue, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

So to find the probability of getting 0 as the measurement result, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors. Then, the probability is the sum of the squares of those inner products.

Alternatively, since P might be a Hermitian matrix (since it's an observable), I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the entries in P are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's check if P^T equals P.

P's transpose would have first column as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second column as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third column as (0, 1/√2, 0). Wait, but wait, no. The original P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So the transpose of P would have columns as the rows of P. So the first column would be 0, 1/√2, 0. Second column is 1/√2, 0, 1/√2. Third column is 0, 1/√2, 0. So the transpose is the same as the original P. So P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. So yes, P is an observable.

So the eigenvalues are real. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's do that by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ      1/√2         0      ]
[1/√2   -λ           1/√2    ]
[ 0      1/√2        -λ      ]

To find the determinant of this matrix, which is a 3x3, I can use the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's choose expansion by minors.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
     - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
     + 0 * [ ... ] (since the last element in the first row is 0, so that term is zero)

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
   - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
   + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

The (P - λ I) matrix is:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Expanding along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Then, minus (1/√2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix from row 1, column 2:

Submatrix is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = - λ / √2.

Then, the third term is 0, so it doesn't contribute.

So putting it together:

det = (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ].

Wait, no. Let me re-express that correctly.

Wait, the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * M11 - (1/√2) * M12 + 0 * M13

Where M11 is the minor for element (1,1), which is determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

M12 is the minor for (1,2), which is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1, column 2 is removed. So the submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = -λ/(√2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) + 0.

Wait, the expansion is:

det = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13

Which in this case is:

= (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, no, perhaps I should re-calculate M12 correctly. When you remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So the minor M12 is the determinant of this submatrix, which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/√2.

So the expansion becomes:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * ( (-λ)/√2 ) + 0.

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2)

So adding these together:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor that:

λ (-λ^2 + 1) ) = 0.

Which gives λ = 0, or -λ^2 + 1 =0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

We are to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0 is the set of eigenvectors associated with λ=0.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0. So we solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0  1/√2  0

Row 2: 1/√2  0  1/√2

Row 3: 0  1/√2  0

So the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → equation 1: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3= 0 → same as equation 1: v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0, and v3 = -v1. Let's express the eigenvectors as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because when solving P v =0, the system's equations might have a higher dimensionality, but in this case, perhaps it's one-dimensional.

Wait, let me double-check.

Equation 1: v2 = 0.

Equation 2: v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

So the variables are v1, v2=0, v3=-v1. So any vector (v1, 0, -v1) is an eigenvector. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1), but we can also normalize it if needed.

Wait, but wait, the state vector given is (-1,2,1). Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the eigenvectors as unit vectors. Let me normalize (1,0,-1).

The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Hmm. So the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this unit vector.

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but wait, I should check if this state vector is normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the state vector's norm is sqrt(6). So perhaps the state vector is not normalized. But when calculating probabilities, we might need to normalize the state.

Wait, wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector. If it's not, perhaps we should normalize it first.

So the state vector given is [ -1; 2; 1 ].

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

But whether it's normalized or not, the probabilities would be calculated based on the inner product with the eigenvectors. However, if the state is not normalized, perhaps we should normalize it before proceeding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is normalized, but in reality, it's not. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, let me proceed.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The eigenvector corresponding to 0 is |v> = [1, 0, -1 ]^T (but normalized, it's [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]).

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and |v>, which is | <v|ψ> |^2.

Wait, but wait, if the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are computed based on the unnormalized vector. Alternatively, perhaps the state should be normalized first.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized for probabilities to sum to 1. So perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a vector without normalization, but in that case, the probability is calculated as the sum of the squares of the projections onto the eigenvectors, but scaled by the norm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by normalizing the state vector |ψ> first.

So, |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Now, the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product <v0 | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 ) multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |ψ>.

But since all the entries are real, it's just the dot product.

So:

<v0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * 1 ) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, |v0> is normalized, so it's [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

So <v0 | ψ> is the dot product of |v0> and |ψ>.

But |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1) 

Which equals [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) ) ] = ( -2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, because |ψ> is not normalized. So when calculating the inner product, should I include the normalization factor?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product as:

< v0 | ψ_normalized >

Where |ψ_normalized> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

So <v0 | ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

That becomes [ (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) ] = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing everything correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not normalize the state vector. Because the observable is represented by a matrix, and the eigenvectors form a basis, but perhaps the probabilities are computed without the state being normalized. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized because the probabilities must sum to 1.

So let me proceed.

If I don't normalize the state, the inner product would be:

< v0 | ψ > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = [ (-1 -1) ] / sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But since the state isn't normalized, the probabilities would be calculated relative to the norm of the state.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

The norm of the state |ψ> is sqrt(6), as we determined earlier.

So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The eigenvector |v0> is normalized as [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Which is [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

Which is (-2) / (sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which corresponds to option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix operator \( P \). The state vector is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the operator \( P \) is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). After computation, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors are found by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). The eigenvectors are of the form \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ 0 \\ -v_1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this vector, the unit eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the State Vector
The given state vector is \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Inner Product and Probability
The probability of measuring 0 is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |v_0\rangle \) and \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh, wait, actually, no, I think I read that wrong. It says it's a column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. So the state vector is [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Then there's an observable represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So I should probably write that out to visualize it better.

Wait, let me write the matrix P explicitly. So P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], the second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], and the third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2      0    ]

Wait, no—did I get that right? Because the second row has elements (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), so yes.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t.

Hmm. So in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So the first step is probably to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, the observable is represented by the operator P, and the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So when we measure P, we get an eigenvalue, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

So to find the probability of getting 0 as the measurement result, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors. Then, the probability is the sum of the squares of those inner products.

Alternatively, since P might be a Hermitian matrix (since it's an observable), I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the entries in P are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's check if P^T equals P.

P's transpose would have first column as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second column as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third column as (0, 1/√2, 0). Wait, but wait, no. The original P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So the transpose of P would have columns as the rows of P. So the first column would be 0, 1/√2, 0. Second column is 1/√2, 0, 1/√2. Third column is 0, 1/√2, 0. So the transpose is the same as the original P. So P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. So yes, P is an observable.

So the eigenvalues are real. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's do that by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ      1/√2         0      ]
[1/√2   -λ           1/√2    ]
[ 0      1/√2        -λ      ]

To find the determinant of this matrix, which is a 3x3, I can use the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's choose expansion by minors.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
     - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
     + 0 * [ ... ] (since the last element in the first row is 0, so that term is zero)

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
   - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
   + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

The (P - λ I) matrix is:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Expanding along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Then, minus (1/√2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix from row 1, column 2:

Submatrix is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = - λ / √2.

Then, the third term is 0, so it doesn't contribute.

So putting it together:

det = (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ].

Wait, no. Let me re-express that correctly.

Wait, the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * M11 - (1/√2) * M12 + 0 * M13

Where M11 is the minor for element (1,1), which is determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

M12 is the minor for (1,2), which is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1, column 2 is removed. So the submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = -λ/(√2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) + 0.

Wait, the expansion is:

det = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13

Which in this case is:

= (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, no, perhaps I should re-calculate M12 correctly. When you remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

So the minor M12 is the determinant of this submatrix, which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/√2.

So the expansion becomes:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * ( (-λ)/√2 ) + 0.

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2)

So adding these together:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor that:

λ (-λ^2 + 1) ) = 0.

Which gives λ = 0, or -λ^2 + 1 =0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

We are to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0 is the set of eigenvectors associated with λ=0.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0. So we solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0  1/√2  0

Row 2: 1/√2  0  1/√2

Row 3: 0  1/√2  0

So the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → equation 1: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3= 0 → same as equation 1: v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0, and v3 = -v1. Let's express the eigenvectors as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because when solving P v =0, the system's equations might have a higher dimensionality, but in this case, perhaps it's one-dimensional.

Wait, let me double-check.

Equation 1: v2 = 0.

Equation 2: v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

So the variables are v1, v2=0, v3=-v1. So any vector (v1, 0, -v1) is an eigenvector. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1), but we can also normalize it if needed.

Wait, but wait, the state vector given is (-1,2,1). Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the eigenvectors as unit vectors. Let me normalize (1,0,-1).

The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Hmm. So the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this unit vector.

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but wait, I should check if this state vector is normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the state vector's norm is sqrt(6). So perhaps the state vector is not normalized. But when calculating probabilities, we might need to normalize the state.

Wait, wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector. If it's not, perhaps we should normalize it first.

So the state vector given is [ -1; 2; 1 ].

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

But whether it's normalized or not, the probabilities would be calculated based on the inner product with the eigenvectors. However, if the state is not normalized, perhaps we should normalize it before proceeding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is normalized, but in reality, it's not. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, let me proceed.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The eigenvector corresponding to 0 is |v> = [1, 0, -1 ]^T (but normalized, it's [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]).

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and |v>, which is | <v|ψ> |^2.

Wait, but wait, if the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are computed based on the unnormalized vector. Alternatively, perhaps the state should be normalized first.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized for probabilities to sum to 1. So perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a vector without normalization, but in that case, the probability is calculated as the sum of the squares of the projections onto the eigenvectors, but scaled by the norm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by normalizing the state vector |ψ> first.

So, |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Now, the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product <v0 | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 ) multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |ψ>.

But since all the entries are real, it's just the dot product.

So:

<v0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * 1 ) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, |v0> is normalized, so it's [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

So <v0 | ψ> is the dot product of |v0> and |ψ>.

But |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1) 

Which equals [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) ) ] = ( -2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, because |ψ> is not normalized. So when calculating the inner product, should I include the normalization factor?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product as:

< v0 | ψ_normalized >

Where |ψ_normalized> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

So <v0 | ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

That becomes [ (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) ] = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing everything correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not normalize the state vector. Because the observable is represented by a matrix, and the eigenvectors form a basis, but perhaps the probabilities are computed without the state being normalized. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized because the probabilities must sum to 1.

So let me proceed.

If I don't normalize the state, the inner product would be:

< v0 | ψ > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = [ (-1 -1) ] / sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But since the state isn't normalized, the probabilities would be calculated relative to the norm of the state.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

The norm of the state |ψ> is sqrt(6), as we determined earlier.

So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The eigenvector |v0> is normalized as [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Which is [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

Which is (-2) / (sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which corresponds to option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix operator \( P \). The state vector is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the operator \( P \) is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). After computation, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors are found by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). The eigenvectors are of the form \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ 0 \\ -v_1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this vector, the unit eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the State Vector
The given state vector is \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Inner Product and Probability
The probability of measuring 0 is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |v_0\rangle \) and \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
