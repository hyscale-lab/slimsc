Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution and how it relates to temperature. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy states is distributed at thermal equilibrium.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is probably equal to k*T, but wait, no, because ΔE here is the energy between two levels, and the Boltzmann factor is about the probability of being in a higher energy state.

So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Right, because the higher energy state is less populated, so the ratio is exponential of that negative term.

In this problem, for star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So n_upper for star1 is twice as much as star2's n_upper. Wait, no, wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe the ratio of excitation (n_upper) in star1 to star2 is 2:1.

So, for each star, the ratio n_upper/n_lower would be determined by their respective temperatures. Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star_1 and T2 as that of star_2.

So for star_1: (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that n_upper1 is twice n_upper2. Wait no, the problem says stars' iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, does that mean the ratio n_upper1 / n_upper2 is 2, or is it the ratio of the excitation (like the population in the upper state compared to their own lower state) is twice as much?

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level (n_upper) is twice as high for star_1 compared to star_2. So:

n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

But we can also express n_upper in terms of n_lower. Let's say that for each star, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: n_upper1 = n_lower1 * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n_upper2 = n_lower2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the total number of atoms in the two levels (n_upper + n_lower) is the same for each star, assuming similar conditions. Or is it? Well, the problem doesn't specify, but I think it's safe to assume that each star's photosphere has the same number of iron atoms in the two levels, so n_upper + n_lower is the same for both. But wait, actually, the problem doesn't state that, so maybe I can't make that assumption. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the upper to lower states for each star is what matters. Because if the total number of atoms in those two levels is the same for each star, then the ratio n_upper/n_lower would be different for each star based on their temperature.

But given the problem, maybe I can proceed by considering the ratio of the excitation for the two stars. So the ratio (n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = (exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me take the ratio:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp[ (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) ]

Factor out ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So the ratio is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

But according to the problem, the excitation is twice as high for star_1. So:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

So the ratio is 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Wait, no, because:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1 ) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2 ) = 2/1 = 2.

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Hmm, let me write that as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, but what's ΔE/(k) ?

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. And Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Wait that can't be right because J/(J/K) = K.

So:

ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Hmm, so putting that into the equation:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K

Wait, but that gives (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) [since the right side is 1 K * (something) = ln(2) K? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have written:

ΔE/(k T) is dimensionless. Let's see: ΔE has units J, k has J/K, T is K. So ΔE/(k T) is (J) / (J/K * K) ) → J/(J) → unitless. Correct.

So in the equation:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Which becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k * 1 (since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k, as k is 1.38e-23 J/K), so substituting:

(1) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2 )

Hmm, which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which rearranges to:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2) / (T1 T2) ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)^2 ]

D) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Wait, according to our equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that's the correct equation.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). This implies \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \).

The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 compared to star_2 is given as 2:1. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, this can be written as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The ratio of these two ratios is:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the excitation ratio is 2:1, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = 2.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me take the ratio:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp[ (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) ]

Factor out ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So the ratio is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

But according to the problem, the excitation is twice as high for star_1. So:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

So the ratio is 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Wait, no, because:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1 ) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2 ) = 2/1 = 2.

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Hmm, let me write that as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Hmm, so putting that into the equation:

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2 )

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). This implies \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \).

The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 compared to star_2 is given as 2:1. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, this can be written as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The ratio of these two ratios is:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the excitation ratio is 2:1, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = 2.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).

Answer: D
