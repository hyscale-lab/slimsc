Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I remember that the formation enthalpy can be calculated using bond energies. But wait, how exactly does that work again?

Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be found by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Alternatively, sometimes it's calculated using atomization energies. Oh wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, which approach should I take here?

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So maybe I should use the bond energies method. Let me recall the formula. I think it's something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, the other way around? No, wait, when bonds are broken, you have to put energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, energy is released (exothermic). So the total enthalpy change is the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed.

But wait, no, wait, more accurately, the enthalpy of reaction is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Because breaking bonds requires energy (so it's a positive value), and forming bonds releases energy (negative value). So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of (reactants broken) minus (products formed).

But wait, I think I might have it reversed. Let me think. Let's say if I have a reaction A → B. The bond energies would be the bonds in A (reactants) and the bonds in B (products). So if more bonds are formed in products than broken in reactants, the reaction is exothermic. So the formula is Enthalpy change = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed). If this is positive, it's endothermic; if negative, exothermic.

But wait, another approach could be using the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization (or atomization energy) is the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule to produce separated atoms. So, for the enthalpy of formation, maybe I can calculate it by considering the atomization of the elements and the bonds in the compound.

Wait, the formula I remember is: ΔHf° (of compound) = [Σ (ΔH atomization of elements) ] - [Σ (bond energies in compound)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, no, wait, that's for the reaction itself. But I'm trying to find the enthalpy of formation of the compound. Oh, wait, perhaps I should think of the formation of the compound from its constituent elements, and use the bond energies to compute that.

So, for the reaction: Elements → Compound.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the enthalpy of formation. To compute this using bond energies, I can think of the reaction as:

Breaking all bonds in the elements (which requires energy) and forming all bonds in the compound (which releases energy).

So the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the elements (as they are in their standard states) minus the sum of the bond energies within the compound.

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite, hydrogen is H2 gas.

So, for each molecule, I need to calculate the bond energies required to break the elements into atoms, then subtract the bond energies used to form the compound.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of atomization given is for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So each carbon atom in the molecule would require 1000 kJ/mol to atomize, but wait, that's per mole of C. So per mole of the compound, the number of C atoms times 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, but when considering bond energies, each bond is counted once. So perhaps I need to calculate all the bonds in the elements (like H-H and C-C, C-H, etc.), then subtract all the bonds in the compound.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the process as:

1. Break all bonds in the reactants (elements) into atoms. This requires energy, so it's an endothermic step.
2. Form all the bonds in the products (the compound). This releases energy, so it's exothermic.

So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of (bonds broken) minus the sum of (bonds formed).

But in this problem, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, which are H2 and C (graphite). The product is the given compound.

So for the elements, the bonds that need to be broken are:

- For carbon: Since carbon is in graphite form, which is a network of C-C bonds. But since each mole of C in graphite has a certain number of C-C bonds, but I'm not sure how to model that. Alternatively, perhaps the approach uses the bond energies of the elements as they are: for carbon, it's the C-C bond energy, and for hydrogen, it's H-H.

Wait, but the problem gives the bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So perhaps the calculation is done as follows:

The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies required to break the elements into atoms (i.e., breaking all the bonds in the elements) minus the bond energies formed in the compound.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The standard approach for bond energies in calculating enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [ (Σ bond energies of reactants) ] - [ (Σ bond energies of products) ]

So, for the reaction:

Elements (reactants) → Compound (products)

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that are broken in the elements. For example, each H2 molecule has an H-H bond, so for each H2 molecule, we break an H-H bond, which contributes +100 kJ/mol (since it's a bond broken, requiring energy).

Similarly, each C in graphite is part of C-C bonds. So, how many C-C bonds are in a mole of carbon (graphite)? Well, graphite has a structure where each C is bonded to three others. But for calculation purposes, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So perhaps that's the energy required to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (graphite) into individual C atoms. So for each mole of C (graphite), the bond energies can be calculated from the atomization energy.

Wait, the problem states "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So the energy to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (which is in the form of graphite) into individual C atoms is 1000 kJ/mol. So that would correspond to the sum of all the C-C bonds in a mole of graphite.

But I'm not sure about the exact number of C-C bonds per mole of carbon. Wait, perhaps this is a simpler approach: the atomization energy is the energy required to convert one mole of the element into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that's 1000 kJ per mole.

So, for each mole of the compound, we can calculate how many moles of C and H are present, and then compute the energy required to break the bonds in the elements into atoms.

So, the steps I think I should follow are:

1. Determine the number of C and H atoms in the given compound.

2. For each C atom, the energy to break the bonds in the element (graphite) is 1000 kJ/mol. But wait, that's per mole of C, so per atom, it's 1000 kJ per mole of C? No, wait. No, because 1 mole of C atoms (as in graphite) requires 1000 kJ to atomize. So, per mole of C in the compound, it's 1000 kJ.

Wait, but the compound has multiple C atoms. Let's say the compound has 'n' C atoms. So the total energy to atomize all C in the compound would be n × 1000 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for H atoms: each H2 molecule is broken into two H atoms. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. So for each H2 molecule, breaking it requires 100 kJ/mol.

So, putting it together:

Total bond energy for reactants (elements) = (number of C atoms × 1000 kJ/mol) + (number of H2 molecules × 100 kJ/mol)

Wait, no, for each H atom, it's part of an H2 molecule. So for each H2 molecule, you break one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ. So, if the compound has 'm' H atoms, then the number of H2 molecules needed is m/2. So the energy for H is (m/2) × 100 kJ/mol.

Then, the bond energies in the compound are the sum of all the bonds present in the compound. So for each C-C bond, it's 200 kJ/mol; each C=C is 300 kJ/mol; each C-H is 400 kJ/mol.

So, for the compound, I need to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds and sum their energies.

Then, the enthalpy of formation ΔHf is [ (C atomization energy) + (H atomization energy) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ].

Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ Σ (reactants bond energies) ] - [ Σ (products bond energies) ]

In this case, the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the compound.

So, the reactants bonds are the C-C bonds in graphite and H-H bonds in H2. So, the sum of the bond energies of the reactants is the sum of all C-C bonds in C and H-H bonds in H2.

The product's bonds are all the bonds in the compound (C-C, C=C, C-H).

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf = [ (sum of C bonds in graphite) + (sum of H-H bonds in H2) ] - [ (sum of C-C, C=C, C-H bonds in the compound) ]

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, not the bond energy for C-C in graphite. Hmm, perhaps I should use the atomization energy to find the bond energy for C-C. Because the atomization energy is the energy needed to break all the C-C bonds in the graphite to make C atoms.

So, for one mole of C atoms (as in graphite), the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. But in graphite, each C is bonded to 3 others. So, let's think about how many C-C bonds are present per mole of C.

Wait, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, each C contributes 3 bonds, but each bond is counted once. So, for one mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is (3/2) moles per mole of C. Because each mole of C has 3 bonds per atom, but each bond is shared between two atoms, so 3/2 per mole of C.

So, the total bond energy for the C-C bonds in graphite would be (number of C-C bonds) × bond energy per bond. The bond energy for C-C is given as 200 kJ/mol, but wait, that's per bond? Or per mole? Hmm, the problem says "Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol." So, each mole of C-C bonds has an energy of 200 kJ.

So, for one mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is 3/2, as each C has 3 bonds but each bond is between two C atoms. So, for one mole of C, 3/2 moles of C-C bonds. Thus, the bond energy for the C in the element (graphite) is (3/2)*200 = 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, perhaps that's a better approach. Because the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the element to produce gaseous atoms. So, for carbon, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. So, in the formula, when we're considering the elements as reactants, the bond energies are the sum of all bonds in the elements.

Wait, but the way we calculate the enthalpy of formation with bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants) ] - [Σ (bonds formed in products) ]

So, for the reactants (C and H2), the bonds broken are C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. The products (compound) have all the bonds in the molecule.

So, to compute the sum of bonds broken in reactants, we need:

- For each mole of C (graphite), the number of C-C bonds is 3/2 per mole (as each C is bonded to three others, but each bond shared between two C atoms). So, for each mole of C, we have 3/2 moles of C-C bonds, each with energy 200 kJ/mol. So the total energy to break C bonds is (3/2)*200 = 300 kJ per mole of C.

Wait, but the atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole of C. So perhaps the bond energy approach is more accurate, but perhaps I should just use the given atomization energy for C.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to calculate the total bond energies of the elements and the compound.

So, let's proceed step by step.

1. Determine the molecular formula of the compound.

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has how many C and H? Let me break it down.

The molecule is symmetric, perhaps. Let me try to count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recognize the structure. Wait, it's 1,3-pentadiene or something else? No, perhaps it's 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene? Not sure, but I'll count each carbon and hydrogen.

But perhaps a better approach is to count each part.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-

This is a propene derivative. (CH3)2C=CH-: the (CH3)2C= is a substituent.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= part has 3 C's (the central C connected to two CH3 and a double bond).

Wait, maybe it's easier to count each C and H.

But perhaps the molecule is made up of two parts, each with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H atoms in the entire molecule.

Let me do that.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count each group.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

- (CH3)2C= has 3 C and 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, two CH3 groups, so 2*3=6 H). The central C is double bonded to another C.

Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-. So, the (CH3)2C= part is one C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. Then the next part is CH-, so the double bond is between the central C and the adjacent C.

So, the first group: (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C (since (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, then the double bond to another C (which is CH-). So, in this group, 4 C's (two CH3, one central, one adjacent), and H's: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2 *3=6 H. The central C has two CH3 groups attached, so 6 H. The adjacent C (CH-) has 1 H. So 6+1=7 H in this group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: count each carbon and hydrogen in the entire molecule.

The entire molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me separate each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 C (2 methyl groups, 1 central, 1 adjacent), H: 2*(3) from methyl groups =6, plus the adjacent CH (1 H) → 7 H.

Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-:

The (CH3)2C= is the central C with two CH3 groups and a double bond. So that's 3 C (two from CH3, one central). The =CH- part is another C (so 4 C here). Each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups → 6 H. The =CH- has one H (since it's CH-). So, 6+1=7 H.

Next part: -CH2- → adds 2 C and 4 H (since CH2 is a single CH2 group; but wait, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let me approach this as a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule can be considered as a chain with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each C and H:

Total structure:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the molecule has 10 carbons: let's see.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 C (maybe?), then the rest adds up. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 C?

Wait, perhaps I can count each part:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, one central, one adjacent).

Then comes a CH2 (adding 1 C), then a CH(CH3) (adding 1 C), then another CH2 (adding 1 C), then a CH=C(CH3)2 (adding 3 C: the central C, one from each CH3).

Wait, wait, the central part is CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH=C has the central C, then a double bond to another C which is attached to two CH3 groups.

So, the CH=C(CH3)2 part has 4 C: the CH, the C with the double bond, and two CH3 groups (but each CH3 is attached to the double-bonded C).

So, in this part, 4 C.

So, adding all parts:

(CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C.

Then, CH2 → 1 C.

Then, CH(CH3) → 1 C.

Then, CH2 → 1 C.

Then, CH=C(CH3)2 → 4 C.

Wait, but then 4+1+1+1+4= 11 C. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcounting.

Alternatively, perhaps let me list each carbon in the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it down:

- (CH3)2C= [C1 connected to two CH3 groups]
- =CH- [C2 connected to C1 and a CH2 group]
- CH2- [C3 connected to C2 and a CH(CH3)]
- CH(CH3)- [C4 connected to C3 and another CH2]
- CH2- [C5 connected to C4 and a CH]
- CH= [C6 connected to C5 and another C]
- C(CH3)2 [C7 connected to C6 and two CH3 groups]

Wait, so from that, I have C1 to C7, but each CH3 adds another C? No, wait, the CH3 groups are attached to the main chain. So, C1 has two CH3 groups (so that's two more C's?), no, wait, each CH3 is a substituent on C1, but they're part of the same C. So C1 is connected to two CH3 (each CH3 is a methyl group, so each is a C attached to three H). So, each CH3 is a branch off C1.

Similarly, the C7 has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the total number of C atoms is:

Each double bond (like C=C) indicates two C's connected by a double bond. Each CH3 is a branch.

But perhaps the best approach is to count each C in the entire structure.

Let me number each C:

1. The first C is the central C in (CH3)2C=, which is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2.

2. C2 is the double-bonded C, connected to C1 and a CH group (CH-).

3. C3 is the CH2 group after C2.

4. C4 is the CH(CH3) group after C3.

5. C5 is the CH2 group after C4.

6. C6 is the CH group after C5, connected via a double bond to C7.

7. C7 is the double-bonded C in the CH=C group, connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, but maybe that's only 7 C's, but perhaps each CH3 branch adds a C.

Wait, each (CH3) group is a methyl group attached to the main chain. So, each CH3 is a separate C? No, because CH3 is -CH3. So each CH3 is a substituent on the main chain's C.

Wait, no, each CH3 is a methyl group, which is a C connected to three H's. So, for the (CH3)2C=CH- group, the structure is:

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C's in CH3, but each is a substituent), but wait, no, each CH3 is a methyl group attached to C1. So, each CH3 in (CH3)2C= is a substituent on C1. So, those are two substituents, each a CH3 group. So, each CH3 is a C connected to three H's.

But in terms of counting the total C atoms in the molecule, each CH3 adds a C. So, for (CH3)2C=CH-, the C1 is one C, each CH3 is another C each. So, (CH3)2C=CH- has 1 (C1) + 2 (from CH3) + 1 (C2, from =CH-) = 4 C atoms.

Similarly, in the CH=C(CH3)2 part, the C7 is one C, and each CH3 is another C each. So, C7 + 2 (from CH3) = 3 C's in that part.

So, let's count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C, 7 H.

2. CH2-: 1 C, 2 H (but as CH2- is connected, perhaps it has 2 H in the group).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the total number of C and H in the entire structure.

The entire structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C and H:

Each (CH3) group is a branch, so each contributes 1 C and 3 H.

So:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the main chain is:

C1 (from (CH3)2C=) → C2 (=CH-) → C3 (CH2-) → C4 (CH(CH3)-) → C5 (CH2-) → C6 (CH-) → C7 (=C(CH3)2).

Wait, that's seven Cs in the main chain.

Now, each (CH3) group adds a C and 3 H.

So, (CH3)2C=CH- → two CH3 groups attached to C1: adds 2 C and 6 H.

Similarly, CH(CH3)- → one CH3 group attached to C4: adds 1 C and 3 H.

And CH=C(CH3)2 → two CH3 groups attached to C7: adds 2 C and 6 H.

So, let's calculate:

Main chain C: 7.

Branches:

- (CH3)2: 2 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- (CH3)2 on C7: 2 C
Total branches: 2 +1 +2 =5 C.

So total C atoms: 7 +5 =12 C.

Wait, but in the main chain, each C is part of the main chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think differently.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent on the main chain's C.

So, the main chain has:

C1 (connected to two CH3 groups)

C2 (connected to C1 via double bond)

C3 (CH2)

C4 (CH(CH3))

C5 (CH2)

C6 (CH)

C7 (connected via double bond to C6, and has two CH3 groups)

So, main chain: 7 C.

Each CH3 group is a substituent, each adding one C and three H.

So, the substituents:

- C1 has two CH3: 2 C, 6 H
- C4 has one CH3: 1 C, 3 H
- C7 has two CH3: 2 C,6 H.

So, substituent C: 2 +1 +2 =5 C.

Total C: 7 (main) +5 (substituent) = 12 C.

Now, hydrogens.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H each. So:

(2 CH3 on C1) → 2 *3=6 H

(1 CH3 on C4) → 3 H

(2 CH3 on C7) → 2*3=6 H

Main chain H:

Each C in the main chain:

C1: (CH3)2C= → each CH3 gives 3 H, but since it's (CH3)2, that's 6 H. But wait, the central C (C1) is connected to the two CH3 groups, so those 6 H are part of the substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each H in all parts.

Main chain:

C1: (CH3)2C= → the central C is connected to three substituents: two CH3 and a double bond. So, no H's on C1 except from substituents.

C2: =CH- → this is CH with one H (since it's double bonded to C1 and connected to C3).

C3: CH2 → connected to C2 and C4. So, two H's on C3.

C4: CH(CH3) → connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 substituent. So, one H on C4.

C5: CH2 → connected to C4 and C6. Two H's.

C6: CH → connected to C5 and C7 via double bond. One H.

C7: C(CH3)2 → connected to C6 via double bond and has two CH3 substituents. No H's on C7, except from substituents.

So, main chain H:

C2: 1 H

C3: 2 H

C4: 1 H

C5: 2 H

C6: 1 H

So, main chain H: 1+2+1+2+1 =7 H.

Substituent H:

Each substituent CH3 contributes 3 H.

Number of substituent CH3 groups:

C1: 2 → 2*3=6 H

C4: 1 → 3 H

C7: 2 → 6 H

Total substituent H: 6+3+6=15 H.

So, total H in molecule: main chain 7 + substituent 15 → 22 H.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's from the main chain.

Wait, each CH2 group has two H's. Let me check each main chain C again for any H's.

C1: (CH3)2C= → no H's on C1.

C2: =CH- → CH has one H.

C3: CH2 → two H's.

C4: CH(CH3) → one H.

C5: CH2 → two H's.

C6: CH → one H.

C7: no H on C7, but substituents have their own H.

So, main chain H is 1+2+1+2+1 =7.

Substituent H: 15.

Total H: 22.

So, the compound has 12 C and 22 H atoms. So the molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, wait, 12 C and 22 H. Let me confirm:

12 C and 22 H → C12H22.

So, the molecular formula is C12H22.

Now, the next step is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (sum of bond energies in reactants) ] - [ (sum of bond energies in products) ]

The reactants are C (graphite) and H2 (gas). The products are the compound C12H22.

So, the sum of bond energies in reactants is the sum of all C-C bonds in graphite and all H-H bonds in H2.

The sum of bond energies in products is the sum of all bonds in C12H22, which includes C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So, let's compute each part.

First, the reactants:

Each mole of C (graphite) as reactant contributes a certain number of C-C bonds. The problem says that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. The atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) into gaseous C atoms. So, the total bond energy in one mole of C (graphite) is 1000 kJ.

But in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is (3/2) moles (since each bond is shared between two C atoms).

So, the bond energy for C-C in graphite for one mole of C is (3/2)*200 kJ/mol = 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the problem gives the bond energy of C-C as 200 kJ/mol. So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of C-C bonds in one mole of C (graphite). Let me think: the structure of graphite is a network of C-C bonds, each C bonded to three others. So, for each C atom, three C-C bonds, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is (3/2) moles.

So, the total bond energy for C in the reactant (graphite) is (3/2)*200 kJ/mol = 300 kJ.

Wait, but each mole of C has (3/2) moles of C-C bonds, each with bond energy 200 kJ. So, per mole of C, 300 kJ.

Similarly, for each mole of H2, we have one mole of H-H bonds, each with bond energy 100 kJ.

Now, the compound has 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms.

So, the number of H2 molecules needed to make 22 H atoms is 22/2 =11 moles of H2.

So, the sum of bond energies in the reactants is:

(C) → 12 moles × 300 kJ/mol (since each C contributes 300 kJ for its C-C bonds in graphite)

Plus,

(H2) → 11 moles × 100 kJ/mol (each H2 contributes one H-H bond of 100 kJ).

Wait, but wait, no. Because each mole of C (graphite) has 300 kJ of C-C bond energy. So, 12 moles of C would contribute 12 × 300 =3600 kJ.

Each H2 contributes 100 kJ, and 11 moles of H2 contribute 11 ×100=1100 kJ.

So, total reactant bond energy: 3600 + 1100 =4700 kJ.

Now, the product's bond energy: sum of all bonds in C12H22.

We need to count all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, let's count each type of bond.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count the bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- part:

- The central C (C1) is connected via double bond to C2.
- C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C-C single bonds).
- C2 is connected to C1 (double bond) and to C3 via a single bond.

2. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 part:

- C3 is connected to C2 and C4 via single bonds.
- C4 is connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 group (single bond).
- C5 is connected to C4 and C6 via single bonds.
- C6 is connected to C5 via single bond and to C7 via double bond.
- C7 is connected to C6 (double bond) and two CH3 groups (single bonds).

Now, let's count each bond type.

C=C bonds: in the structure, there are two double bonds.

Wait, in the given structure, the molecule has two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

So, two C=C bonds.

C-C single bonds:

Each single bond between C atoms in the main chain, and each single bond connecting substituents.

Let me count each C-C single bond:

Looking at the main chain:

C1-C2: double bond (so not counted as single).
C2-C3: single → 1
C3-C4: single → 1
C4-C5: single →1
C5-C6: single →1
C6-C7: double bond (not counted as single).

So, four C-C single bonds in the main chain.

Additionally, each substituent contributes C-C bonds:

Each (CH3) group is a C connected to the main chain C via a single bond. So each substituent adds a C-C single bond.

So, substituents:

C1 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.
C4 has one CH3 group → one C-C bond.
C7 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

So substituent C-C bonds: 2 +1 +2 =5.

So total C-C single bonds: main chain (4) + substituent (5) →9.

Each C-C single bond has bond energy 200 kJ/mol.

So, C-C bonds contribute 9 × 200 = 1800 kJ.

C=C bonds: two double bonds, each 300 kJ → 2 ×300=600 kJ.

C-H bonds:

Each C connected to H contributes a C-H bond.

Let me count the C-H bonds.

Looking at each C:

C1: (CH3)2 → 2 ×3 H (wait, each CH3 has three H, but connected to C1. So C1 is connected to 6 H via C-H bonds.

Wait no, each CH3 is a substituent, so C1 is connected to two CH3 groups, each contributing three H, but each C-H bond is a single bond. So, each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is a substituent on C1. So, each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. But since there are two CH3 groups, that's 6 C-H bonds.

Similarly:

C2: =CH- → one C-H bond.

C3: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C4: CH(CH3) → one C-H bond (since it's CH with a substituent).

C5: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C6: CH → one C-H bond.

C7: C(CH3)2 → no C-H bonds on C7, but each substituent CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups → 6 C-H bonds.

So, let's count each C-H bond:

C1: 2 CH3 → 2×3=6 bonds.

C2: 1 bond.

C3: 2 bonds.

C4: 1 bond.

C5: 2 bonds.

C6: 1 bond.

C7: 2 CH3 → 2×3=6 bonds.

So total C-H bonds:6 +1 +2 +1 +2 +1 +6 =19.

Wait, 6 (C1) +1 (C2) =7; then +2 (C3)=9; +1 (C4)=10; +2 (C5)=12; +1 (C6)=13; +6 (C7)=19.

So 19 C-H bonds.

Each C-H bond has bond energy 400 kJ/mol.

So, C-H bonds contribute 19 ×400 =7600 kJ.

Now, summing all bonds in the product:

C-C: 1800 kJ

C=C:600 kJ

C-H:7600 kJ

Total bonds in product: 1800 +600 +7600 = 10,000 kJ.

Wait, 1800 +600 is 2400, plus 7600 is 10,000 kJ.

So, the product's total bond energy is10,000 kJ.

Now, the reactant's total bond energy is4700 kJ (as calculated earlier: 3600 from C and 1100 from H2).

So, the enthalpy change ΔHf° is reactant bonds - product bonds.

ΔHf° =4700 kJ -10,000 kJ = -5300 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's a negative value, which would imply an exothermic formation. But looking at the options, none of them are in the -5000 range. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of bonds.

Let me recount the product bonds.

C-C single bonds: earlier I thought 9.

Wait, let me recount:

Main chain C-C single bonds:

C2-C3 →1

C3-C4 →1

C4-C5 →1

C5-C6 →1

So that's four.

Substituent C-C bonds:

C1 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

C4 has one CH3 → one C-C bond.

C7 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

Total substituent C-C:5.

So, main chain C-C:4, substituent C-C:5 →9.

So that's correct.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:19.

So, 9×200=1800, 2×300=600, 19×400=7600.

Total: 1800+600=2400 +7600=10,000 kJ.

Reactant bonds:12×300 (for C) +11×100 (for H2) →3600 +1100=4700.

So, 4700 -10,000 = -5300 kJ.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So I'm definitely making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the enthalpy of atomization is not the same as the bond energy of C-C in graphite. Because the atomization energy is the energy needed to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) to make C atoms. So, the bond energy is the sum of all C-C bonds in the element (graphite) per mole of C.

Wait, for C, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. That is, the energy required to break all C-C bonds in a mole of C (graphite) into gaseous C atoms.

So, the sum of bond energies in the reactants should be:

12 moles of C ×1000 kJ/mol (since each C in graphite requires 1000 kJ to atomize).

Wait, wait, that would be:

C:12 ×1000=12,000 kJ.

H2: 11 ×100 =1100 kJ.

So, total reactant bond energy:12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ.

Then, product's bond energy:10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=13,100 -10,000=3,100 kJ/mol.

But that's 3100 kJ/mol, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the approach. Maybe the problem expects me to use the given bond energies directly, without considering the C-C bond in graphite.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation by considering the bonds in the compound and the bonds in the elements (H2 and C).

Wait, the formula is: ΔHf = [sum of bonds broken in elements] - [sum of bonds formed in compound].

So, bonds broken in elements:

For C, each C in graphite has bonds broken. The number of C-C bonds per C is 3/2, as before. So per mole of C, bond energy is 300 kJ.

So, 12 moles of C →12 ×300=3600 kJ.

For H2: each H2 has one H-H bond. So 11 moles of H2 →11 ×100=1100 kJ.

Total bonds broken in elements:3600 +1100=4700 kJ.

Bonds formed in compound:

As before, 9×200=1800 (C-C), 2×300=600 (C=C), 19×400=7600 (C-H).

Total:10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=4700 -10,000= -5300 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should not use the enthalpy of atomization for C but instead use the given bond energies for C-C and C=C.

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for C-C (200), C=C (300), C-H (400), and H-H (100).

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the enthalpy of formation using:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ].

Wait, but the problem only gives the enthalpy of atomization for C, not for H. Oh, but the bond energy for H-H is given as 100.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization for H is the same as the bond energy of H-H, which is 100 kJ/mol per mole of bond. So, each H atom's enthalpy of atomization would be 50 kJ (since each H-H bond breaks into two H atoms, so 100 kJ per mole of bond → 50 kJ per mole of H atoms).

Wait, because for H2, each mole of H-H bond has 100 kJ. Breaking H2 into 2 H atoms requires 100 kJ per mole of H2. So per H atom, it's 50 kJ.

So, the enthalpy of atomization for H is 50 kJ/mol.

So, for the compound, the total enthalpy of atomization would be:

(12 ×1000) + (22 ×50) =12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ.

Then, subtract the sum of bond energies in the compound (10,000 kJ):

ΔHf=13,100 -10,000=3,100 kJ/mol.

This matches the earlier result of 3100 kJ, which isn't an option.

Hmm. But the options don't include this. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility is that the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. Looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g and D is 1900 kJ/g.

So, perhaps the answer is in kJ per gram, not per mole.

So, let's calculate the molar mass of the compound.

The compound is C12H22.

Molar mass:12×12 +22×1 =144 +22=166 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 3100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 3100 /166 ≈18.61 kJ/g.

But that's not matching any options. Option D is 1900, which is way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the sum of the bonds in the compound.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) – (sum of bond energies in products)

But the reactants are the elements in their standard states.

So, for C, the bond energy is the C-C bond in graphite. For H2, it's the H-H bond.

So, the total bond energy of the reactants is:

(12 × (3/2 ×200)) + (11 ×100) =12×300 +1100=3600+1100=4700.

Product's bond energy:10,000 as before.

ΔHf=4700-10,000= -5300 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

ΔHf = [ sum of bonds in products ] – [ sum of bonds in reactants ].

Which would be 10,000 –4700=5300.

But that's positive. Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm counting the bonds incorrectly.

Let me recount the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the product.

Another approach: Let's write the structure and count each bond.

The structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each double bond is a C=C.

Count C-C single bonds:

Each CH2 group contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH3 substituent contributes one C-C bond.

So, perhaps I should count each C-C single bond:

Let me list the structure and count each single C-C bond.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking at each C and their connections:

C1 (CH3)2C= → connected to C2 (double bond) and two CH3 groups.

C2= → connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

C3-CH2 → connected to C2 and C4.

C4-CH(CH3) → connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 group.

C5-CH2 → connected to C4 and C6.

C6-CH- → connected to C5 and C7 (double bond).

C7=C(CH3)2 → connected to C6 (double bond) and two CH3 groups.

So, single C-C bonds:

C1-C3: No, because C1 is connected to C2 via double bond.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

The molecule has:

- Two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

The main chain has:

C1 (CH3)2C= — C2 =CH— C3 — C4 — C5 — C6 — C7=C(CH3)2.

In this main chain:

C2 is double bonded to C1, single bonded to C3.

C3 is single bonded to C2 and C4.

C4 is single bonded to C3 and C5.

C5 is single bonded to C4 and C6.

C6 is single bonded to C5 and double bonded to C7.

So, the single C-C bonds in the main chain are:

C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 → four bonds.

Each substituent:

C1 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

C4 has one CH3 → one C-C bond.

C7 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

So, substituent C-C bonds: 2 +1 +2 =5.

Main chain C-C bonds:4.

So, total C-C single bonds:4+5=9.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H bonds.

C1 has two CH3 →6.

C2 has one CH →1.

C3 has two CH2 → but C3 is CH2, so two H's → two C-H bonds.

C4 is CH(CH3) → one H on C4.

C5 is CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C6 is CH → one C-H bond.

C7 has no H on itself, but the two CH3 groups →6.

So, C-H bonds:6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C7) → total 19.

So, same as before.

So, the product's bonds are:

C-C:9×200=1800.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:19×400=7600.

Total 1800+600+7600=10,000.

Reactants:

For each C, the bond energy is 300 kJ (as calculated earlier: 3/2 ×200).

12 C →12×300=3600.

H2:11 ×100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:3600+1100=4700.

So, ΔHf=4700 –10,000=–5300 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the enthalpy of atomization and not considering the bond energies in the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies provided without considering the C-C bond in the element (graphite), which is perhaps not given.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, earlier I thought the formula is C12H22, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Let me recount the carbons and hydrogens.

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent.

Let me count each C:

Each (CH3) is one C.

(CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, C, and the adjacent C).

CH2 →1 C.

CH(CH3) →1 C.

CH2 →1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, and two CH3).

So, 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

Wait, that's 10 C. Did I count wrong earlier?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is 4 C, then CH2 (1 C), CH(CH3) (1 C), CH2 (1 C), CH=C(CH3)2 (3 C)—total 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

So, 10 C.

Hydrogens:

Each CH3 is 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Two CH3 →6 H.

- CH- has 1 H.

In CH2-: each has 2 H.

In CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, plus the substituent CH3 →3 H.

In CH2-: 2 H.

In CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and two CH3→6 H.

Wait, perhaps a better way:

Main chain: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

- (CH3)2C=CH- →4 C, 7 H.

- CH2 →1 C, 2 H.

- CH(CH3) →1 C, 4 H (since CH(CH3) has one H and the substituent has 3 H).

- CH2 →1 C, 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C, 7 H (CH has 1 H, C=C has no H on the double bond, and two CH3 have 6 H).

So, total C:4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

H:

7 (from first part) +2 +4 +2 +7 →22 H.

So, the formula is C10H22.

Ah! Earlier, I mistakenly counted 12 C, but it's actually 10 C.

So, the correct molecular formula is C10H22.

So, this changes everything.

Now, recalculating:

Number of C atoms:10.

Number of H atoms:22.

So, the reactant bonds:

C:10 ×300=3000 kJ.

H:22/2=11 moles of H2 →11 ×100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:3000+1100=4100 kJ.

Product bonds:

C-C:9×200=1800.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:19×400=7600.

Total product bonds:1800+600+7600=10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900 kJ/mol.

Hmm, that's still not matching the options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of substituent C-C bonds.

Wait, with C10H22, let's recount substituent C-C bonds.

Main chain: C1 to C10? No, earlier I thought the main chain has 10 C? No, with C10H22, the main chain is likely shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product bond calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, such as using the enthalpy of atomization and not bond energies.

Wait, perhaps the formula to use is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ atomization energies of elements) ] – [ Σ bond energies in compound ]

So, for the compound:

Σ atomization energies = (10 ×1000) + (22 ×50) =10,000 + 1100=11,100 kJ.

Σ bond energies in compound=10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=11,100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either, but option A is 11200, which is close.

Wait, 11,100 kJ/mol would be 11,100, which is about 11,100, but option A is 11,200. Close, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24 instead of 22.

If H is 24, then:

Σ atomization energies =10×1000 +24×50=10,000 +1200=11,200.

Then, ΔHf=11,200 –10,000=1,200.

But option A is 11200, which would be 11,200. Hmm, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24.

Let me recount the H atoms.

Structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group has 3 H.

Let me count H again:

Main chain:

Each C in main chain:

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: =CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H (on C4) +3 H (from CH3 substituent) →4 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: =C(CH3)2 → no H on C7, but two CH3 substituents →6 H.

So, main chain H:6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +4 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C7) →6+1=7, +2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +1=16, +6=22.

So 22 H.

Hmm, so the initial count was correct. So, why is option A 11200? Because 10 C and 22 H gives 10,000 + (22×50)=10,000 +1100=11,100.

So, ΔHf=11,100–10,000=1,100.

Hmm, but option A is 11,200.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is different. Maybe the enthalpy of atomization is not used, but the bond energies of the elements are considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of bonds in the compound and subtract them from the bonds in the elements.

But I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g.

If I calculate the molar mass of C10H22, it's 10×12 +22×1=120 +22=142 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 1,100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1100 /142 ≈7.74 kJ/g, which is not an option. Alternatively, if it were 11,200 kJ/mol, per gram would be 11,200 /142≈79 kJ/g, also not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [Σ (elements' bond energies)] – [Σ (compound's bond energies)].

So, if the sum of elements' bonds is 4100 kJ (as for C10H22), and the compound's bonds are 10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000= -5900 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, and the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energies in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization for C, which is 1000 kJ/mol, and the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, for the compound, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of all C and H atoms, minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

So:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × 1000) + (number of H atoms × 50) ] – [ sum of bond energies in compound ]

Wait, because each H atom requires 50 kJ (half of H-H bond energy) to be atomized.

So, for C10H22:

ΔHf= [10×1000 +22×50] – [ sum of product bonds ]

=10,000 +1100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but option A is 11,200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. Let me recount.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C.

Each CH2 is 1 C.

Each CH(CH3) is 1 C.

Each CH2 is 1 C.

Each CH= is 1 C.

Each C(CH3)2 is 1 C.

Wait, that's 4 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I'm really confused. Let me try again.

The structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, C, adjacent C).
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH(CH3) →1 C.
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, two CH3).

Wait, that's 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

Hmm, but maybe the structure is symmetric, so perhaps the molecule has fewer C atoms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C10H22, which would have 10 C and 22 H.

So, recalculating:

ΔHf= [10×1000 +22×50 ] – 10,000 = (10,000 +1,100) –10,000 =1,100 kJ/mol.

But option A is 11,200, which is 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using per mole of compound, but the answer is per mole of C or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation per mole of C, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies as per bond, not per mole.

Wait, no, the given bond energies are per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound using the given bond energies, but without considering the C-C bonds in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) – (sum of bond energies in compound).

But the elements are H2 and C.

Each C in the compound came from C in graphite, which has C-C bonds with energy 200 kJ per mole.

Each H2 has H-H bonds of 100 kJ per mole.

So, for the compound:

Number of C atoms:10.

So, 10 × (3/2 ×200) =10 ×300=3000 kJ.

Number of H atoms:22 →11 H2 molecules →11 ×100=1100 kJ.

Total reactant bonds:3000 +1100=4100 kJ.

Product bonds:10,000 kJ.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900 kJ/mol.

But this is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol. How?

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the number of C and H in the compound and use only the given bond energies.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) – (sum of bond energies in compound).

But perhaps the elements are considered as C (atomized) and H (atomized), not as H2.

So, for each C atom, the bond energy is 1000 kJ (atomization).

For each H atom, the bond energy is 50 kJ (since H-H is 100 kJ per mole, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

So, for the compound C10H22:

Σ atomization energies =10×1000 +22×50=10,000 +1100=11,100 kJ.

Σ bond energies in compound=10,000 kJ.

ΔHf=11,100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

But 1,100 kJ/mol is 1100, not 11200.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the enthalpy of atomization of the compound itself, but that's not the same as the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given bond energies are per bond, not per mole.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

Bond energies given are per mole. So, for example, C-C is 200 kJ/mol.

So, perhaps the approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8 instead of 9.

Let me recount C-C bonds:

In the structure, main chain C-C bonds:

C2-C3:1

C3-C4:1

C4-C5:1

C5-C6:1

So, four.

Substituent C-C bonds:

C1 has two CH3 → two.

C4 has one CH3 → one.

C7 has two CH3 → two.

Total substituent C-C:5.

Main chain:4.

Total C-C:9.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering each C=C double bond as two C-C bonds. So, for each C=C, it's two C-C single bonds.

If that's the case, then each C=C contributes two C-C bonds, each with 200 kJ. So, two C=C bonds would contribute 4×200=800 kJ.

Wait, but that's not how bond energies work. Each double bond is a C=C, which has a bond energy of 300 kJ per mole. So, it's not equivalent to two single bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization but also considering the triple bonds or other factors, but that's unlikely.

Given that I'm stuck and the options don't match my calculations, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24, making the formula C10H24.

Then, the sum would be:

10×1000 +24×50=10,000 +1200=11,200.

ΔHf=11,200 –10,000=1,200 kJ/mol.

Which is 1200, but option A is 11200.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule as a whole, but I'm not counting the bonds correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each double bond contributes to the bond count.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have counted the C=C bonds as two C-C bonds each, leading to more C-C bonds.

But that would change the calculations.

But I think I'm at an impasse here, as I can't find a way to get any of the options to match. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, but 67.4 is much smaller than the numbers I've been getting. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach leads to option B.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies in reactants) ] – [ (Σ bond energies in products) ]

But earlier calculations gave -5300 or -5900, which don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation per gram, and I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, molar mass of C10H22 is 10×12 +22×1=120+22=142 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 1100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1100 /142 ≈7.74 kJ/g, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if the ΔHf is 11,100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 11,100 /142 ≈78.17 kJ/g, which isn't an option either.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that number.

Wait, 67.4 kJ/mol is approximately 67400 J/mol. If I have 10,000 kJ for product bonds and 10,000 – 67400= negative, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the bond energies in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies in product) ] – [ (Σ bond energies in reactants) ]

Which would give 10,000 –4100=5900 kJ/mol.

But that's positive 5900, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies.

Wait, the bond energies are:

C-C:200 kJ/mol.

C=C:300 kJ/mol.

C-H:400 kJ/mol.

H-H:100 kJ/mol.

Enthalpy of atomization of C:1000 kJ/mol.

So, for C, each mole of C in graphite contributes 300 kJ (3/2 ×200) as earlier.

So, for 10 C: 10 ×300=3000.

H2:22/2=11 moles →11 ×100=1100.

Total reactants:4100.

Products:10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900.

But this is negative, which is exothermic. The options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the enthalpy of atomization and then subtract the bond energies of the compound.

Which would be:

ΔHf= (10×1000 +22×50) – (10,000 )=11,100 –10,000=1,100.

But this is 1,100, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the number of bonds in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I'm counting the C-H bonds incorrectly. Let me recount.

Each (CH3) group has 3 C-H bonds.

C1 has two (CH3) →6.

C2 has one CH →1.

C3 has CH2 →2.

C4 has CH(CH3) →1.

C5 has CH2 →2.

C6 has CH →1.

C7 has two (CH3) →6.

Adding them up:6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +6=19.

So correct count is 19.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is intended to have a different answer. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, 67.4 is approximately 67400 J/mol. If the ΔHf is 67,400 J/mol =67.4 kJ/mol.

How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the number of C and H is different. Suppose the formula is C8H14.

Then:

Σ atomization:

8×1000 +14×50=8000 +700=8700.

Σ product bonds: ?

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the compound to be something else, but the structure given is different.

In any case, I'm stuck and perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The structure was analyzed, and the molecular formula was determined to be **C10H22**. This was verified by counting the carbons and hydrogens in the structure.

2. **Calculate the total bond energies in the compound**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 9 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 19 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 7600 kJ.  
   - **Total bond energy in the compound**:  
     \[
     1800 + 600 + 7600 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total bond energies in the reactants (elements)**:  
   - For carbon (graphite): Each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize. Since the compound contains 10 carbons, the total energy for carbon is:  
     \[
     10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
   - For hydrogen: Each mole of H-H bonds requires 100 kJ/mol. The compound contains 22 hydrogens, which corresponds to 11 moles of H2:  
     \[
     11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
   - **Total bond energy in the reactants**:  
     \[
     10,000 + 1100 = 11,100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Sum of bond energies in reactants} - \text{Sum of bond energies in products}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 11,100 - 10,000 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Convert to per gram (if necessary)**:  
   The molar mass of the compound is:  
   \[
   10 \times 12 + 22 \times 1 = 142 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   The enthalpy of formation per gram is:  
   \[
   \frac{1,100}{142} \approx 7.74 \, \text{kJ/g}.
   \]

6. **Compare with the options**:  
   None of the calculated values (1,100 kJ/mol or 7.74 kJ/g) match the provided options. However, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** was considered as a potential answer, though the reasoning to reach this value was unclear. It is possible that the problem involves a different interpretation of bond energies or molecular structure.

**Final Answer**:  
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer from the given options is:  
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I remember that the formation enthalpy can be calculated using bond energies. But wait, how exactly does that work again?

Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be found by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Alternatively, sometimes it's calculated using atomization energies. Oh wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, which approach should I take here?

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So maybe I should use the bond energies method. Let me recall the formula. I think it's something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, the other way around? No, wait, when bonds are broken, you have to put energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, energy is released (exothermic). So the total enthalpy change is the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed.

But wait, no, wait, more accurately, the enthalpy of reaction is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Because breaking bonds requires energy (so it's a positive value), and forming bonds releases energy (negative value). So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of (reactants broken) minus (products formed).

But wait, I think I might have it reversed. Let me think. Let's say if I have a reaction A → B. The bond energies would be the bonds in A (reactants) and the bonds in B (products). So if more bonds are formed in products than broken in reactants, the reaction is exothermic. So the formula is Enthalpy change = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed). If this is positive, it's endothermic; if negative, exothermic.

But wait, another approach could be using the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization (or atomization energy) is the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule to produce separated atoms. So, for the enthalpy of formation, maybe I can calculate it by considering the atomization of the elements and the bonds in the compound.

Wait, the formula I remember is: ΔHf° (of compound) = [Σ (ΔH atomization of elements) ] - [Σ (bond energies in compound)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, no, wait, that's for the reaction itself. But I'm trying to find the enthalpy of formation of the compound. Oh, wait, perhaps I should think of the formation of the compound from its constituent elements, and use the bond energies to compute that.

So, for the reaction: Elements → Compound.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the enthalpy of formation. To compute this using bond energies, I can think of the reaction as:

Breaking all bonds in the elements (which requires energy) and forming all bonds in the compound (which releases energy).

So the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the elements (as they are in their standard states) minus the sum of the bond energies within the compound.

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite, hydrogen is H2 gas.

So, for each molecule, I need to calculate the bond energies required to break the elements into atoms, then subtract the bond energies used to form the compound.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of atomization given is for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So each carbon atom in the molecule would require 1000 kJ/mol to atomize, but wait, that's per mole of C. So per mole of the compound, the number of C atoms times 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, but when considering bond energies, each bond is counted once. So perhaps I need to calculate all the bonds in the elements (like H-H and C-C, C-H, etc.), then subtract all the bonds in the compound.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the process as:

1. Break all bonds in the reactants (elements) into atoms. This requires energy, so it's an endothermic step.
2. Form all the bonds in the products (the compound). This releases energy, so it's exothermic.

So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of (bonds broken) minus the sum of (bonds formed).

But in this problem, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, which are H2 and C (graphite). The product is the given compound.

So for the elements, the bonds that need to be broken are:

- For carbon: Since carbon is in graphite form, which is a network of C-C bonds. But since each mole of C in graphite has a certain number of C-C bonds, but I'm not sure how to model that. Alternatively, perhaps the approach uses the bond energies of the elements as they are: for carbon, it's the C-C bond energy, and for hydrogen, it's H-H.

Wait, but the problem gives the bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So perhaps the calculation is done as follows:

The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies required to break the elements into atoms (i.e., breaking all the bonds in the elements) minus the bond energies formed in the compound.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The standard approach for bond energies in calculating enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [ (Σ bond energies of reactants) ] - [ (Σ bond energies of products) ]

So, for the reaction:

Elements (reactants) → Compound (products)

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that are broken in the elements. For example, each H2 molecule has an H-H bond, so for each H2 molecule, we break an H-H bond, which contributes +100 kJ/mol (since it's a bond broken, requiring energy).

Similarly, each C in graphite is part of C-C bonds. So, how many C-C bonds are in a mole of carbon (graphite)? Well, graphite has a structure where each C is bonded to three others. But for calculation purposes, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So perhaps that's the energy required to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (graphite) into individual C atoms. So for each mole of C (graphite), the bond energies can be calculated from the atomization energy.

Wait, the problem states "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So the energy to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (which is in the form of graphite) into individual C atoms is 1000 kJ/mol. So that would correspond to the sum of all the C-C bonds in a mole of graphite.

But I'm not sure about the exact number of C-C bonds per mole of carbon. Wait, perhaps this is a simpler approach: the atomization energy is the energy required to convert one mole of the element into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that's 1000 kJ per mole.

So, for each mole of the compound, we can calculate how many moles of C and H are present, and then compute the energy required to break the bonds in the elements into atoms.

So, the steps I think I should follow are:

1. Determine the number of C and H atoms in the given compound.

2. For each C atom, the energy to break the bonds in the element (graphite) is 1000 kJ/mol. But wait, that's per mole of C, so per atom, it's 1000 kJ per mole of C? No, wait. No, because 1 mole of C atoms (as in graphite) requires 1000 kJ to atomize. So, per mole of C in the compound, it's 1000 kJ.

Wait, but the compound has multiple C atoms. Let's say the compound has 'n' C atoms. So the total energy to atomize all C in the compound would be n × 1000 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for H atoms: each H2 molecule is broken into two H atoms. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. So for each H2 molecule, breaking it requires 100 kJ/mol.

So, putting it together:

Total bond energy for reactants (elements) = (number of C atoms × 1000 kJ/mol) + (number of H2 molecules × 100 kJ/mol)

Wait, no, for each H atom, it's part of an H2 molecule. So for each H2 molecule, you break one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ. So, if the compound has 'm' H atoms, then the number of H2 molecules needed is m/2. So the energy for H is (m/2) × 100 kJ/mol.

Then, the bond energies in the compound are the sum of all the bonds present in the compound. So for each C-C bond, it's 200 kJ/mol; each C=C is 300 kJ/mol; each C-H is 400 kJ/mol.

So, for the compound, I need to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds and sum their energies.

Then, the enthalpy of formation ΔHf is [ (C atomization energy) + (H atomization energy) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ].

Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ Σ (reactants bond energies) ] - [ Σ (products bond energies) ]

In this case, the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the compound.

So, the reactants bonds are the C-C bonds in graphite and H-H bonds in H2. So, the sum of the bond energies of the reactants is the sum of all C-C bonds in C and H-H bonds in H2.

The product's bonds are all the bonds in the compound (C-C, C=C, C-H).

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf = [ (sum of C bonds in graphite) + (sum of H-H bonds in H2) ] - [ (sum of C-C, C=C, C-H bonds in the compound) ]

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, not the bond energy for C-C in graphite. Hmm, perhaps I should use the atomization energy to find the bond energy for C-C. Because the atomization energy is the energy needed to break all the C-C bonds in the graphite to make C atoms.

So, for one mole of C atoms (as in graphite), the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. But in graphite, each C is bonded to 3 others. So, let's think about how many C-C bonds are present per mole of C.

Wait, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, each C contributes 3 bonds, but each bond is counted once. So, for one mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is (3/2) moles per mole of C. Because each mole of C has 3 bonds per atom, but each bond is shared between two atoms, so 3/2 per mole of C.

So, the total bond energy for the C-C bonds in graphite would be (number of C-C bonds) × bond energy per bond. The bond energy for C-C is given as 200 kJ/mol, but wait, that's per bond? Or per mole? Hmm, the problem says "Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol." So, each mole of C-C bonds has an energy of 200 kJ.

So, for one mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is 3/2, as each C has 3 bonds but each bond is between two C atoms. So, for one mole of C, 3/2 moles of C-C bonds. Thus, the bond energy for the C in the element (graphite) is (3/2)*200 = 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, perhaps that's a better approach. Because the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the element to produce gaseous atoms. So, for carbon, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. So, in the formula, when we're considering the elements as reactants, the bond energies are the sum of all bonds in the elements.

Wait, but the way we calculate the enthalpy of formation with bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants) ] - [Σ (bonds formed in products) ]

So, for the reactants (C and H2), the bonds broken are C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. The products (compound) have all the bonds in the molecule.

So, to compute the sum of bonds broken in reactants, we need:

- For each mole of C (graphite), the number of C-C bonds is 3/2 per mole (as each C is bonded to three others, but each bond shared between two C atoms). So, for each mole of C, we have 3/2 moles of C-C bonds, each with energy 200 kJ/mol. So the total energy to break C bonds is (3/2)*200 = 300 kJ per mole of C.

Wait, but the atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole of C. So perhaps the bond energy approach is more accurate, but perhaps I should just use the given atomization energy for C.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to calculate the total bond energies of the elements and the compound.

So, let's proceed step by step.

1. Determine the molecular formula of the compound.

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has how many C and H? Let me break it down.

The molecule is symmetric, perhaps. Let me try to count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recognize the structure. Wait, it's 1,3-pentadiene or something else? No, perhaps it's 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene? Not sure, but I'll count each carbon and hydrogen.

But perhaps a better approach is to count each part.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-

This is a propene derivative. (CH3)2C=CH-: the (CH3)2C= is a substituent.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= part has 3 C's (the central C connected to two CH3 and a double bond).

Wait, maybe it's easier to count each C and H.

But perhaps the molecule is made up of two parts, each with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H atoms in the entire molecule.

Let me do that.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count each group.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

- (CH3)2C= has 3 C and 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, two CH3 groups, so 2*3=6 H). The central C is double bonded to another C.

Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-. So, the (CH3)2C= part is one C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. Then the next part is CH-, so the double bond is between the central C and the adjacent C.

So, the first group: (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C (since (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, then the double bond to another C (which is CH-). So, in this group, 4 C's (two CH3, one central, one adjacent), and H's: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2 *3=6 H. The central C has two CH3 groups attached, so 6 H. The adjacent C (CH-) has 1 H. So 6+1=7 H in this group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: count each carbon and hydrogen in the entire molecule.

The entire molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me separate each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 C (2 methyl groups, 1 central, 1 adjacent), H: 2*(3) from methyl groups =6, plus the adjacent CH (1 H) → 7 H.

Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-:

The (CH3)2C= is the central C with two CH3 groups and a double bond. So that's 3 C (two from CH3, one central). The =CH- part is another C (so 4 C here). Each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups → 6 H. The =CH- has one H (since it's CH-). So, 6+1=7 H.

Next part: -CH2- → adds 2 C and 4 H (since CH2 is a single CH2 group; but wait, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let me approach this as a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule can be considered as a chain with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each C and H:

Total structure:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the molecule has 10 carbons: let's see.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 C (maybe?), then the rest adds up. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 C?

Wait, perhaps I can count each part:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, one central, one adjacent).

Then comes a CH2 (adding 1 C), then a CH(CH3) (adding 1 C), then another CH2 (adding 1 C), then a CH=C(CH3)2 (adding 3 C: the central C, one from each CH3).

Wait, wait, the central part is CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH=C has the central C, then a double bond to another C which is attached to two CH3 groups.

So, the CH=C(CH3)2 part has 4 C: the CH, the C with the double bond, and two CH3 groups (but each CH3 is attached to the double-bonded C).

So, in this part, 4 C.

So, adding all parts:

(CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C.

Then, CH2 → 1 C.

Then, CH(CH3) → 1 C.

Then, CH2 → 1 C.

Then, CH=C(CH3)2 → 4 C.

Wait, but then 4+1+1+1+4= 11 C. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcounting.

Alternatively, perhaps let me list each carbon in the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it down:

- (CH3)2C= [C1 connected to two CH3 groups]
- =CH- [C2 connected to C1 and a CH2 group]
- CH2- [C3 connected to C2 and a CH(CH3)]
- CH(CH3)- [C4 connected to C3 and another CH2]
- CH2- [C5 connected to C4 and a CH]
- CH= [C6 connected to C5 and another C]
- C(CH3)2 [C7 connected to C6 and two CH3 groups]

Wait, so from that, I have C1 to C7, but each CH3 adds another C? No, wait, the CH3 groups are attached to the main chain. So, C1 has two CH3 groups (so that's two more C's?), no, wait, each CH3 is a substituent on C1, but they're part of the same C. So C1 is connected to two CH3 (each CH3 is a methyl group, so each is a C attached to three H). So, each CH3 is a branch off C1.

Similarly, the C7 has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the total number of C atoms is:

Each double bond (like C=C) indicates two C's connected by a double bond. Each CH3 is a branch.

But perhaps the best approach is to count each C in the entire structure.

Let me number each C:

1. The first C is the central C in (CH3)2C=, which is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2.

2. C2 is the double-bonded C, connected to C1 and a CH group (CH-).

3. C3 is the CH2 group after C2.

4. C4 is the CH(CH3) group after C3.

5. C5 is the CH2 group after C4.

6. C6 is the CH group after C5, connected via a double bond to C7.

7. C7 is the double-bonded C in the CH=C group, connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, but maybe that's only 7 C's, but perhaps each CH3 branch adds a C.

Wait, each (CH3) group is a methyl group attached to the main chain. So, each CH3 is a separate C? No, because CH3 is -CH3. So each CH3 is a substituent on the main chain's C.

Wait, no, each CH3 is a methyl group, which is a C connected to three H's. So, for the (CH3)2C=CH- group, the structure is:

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C's in CH3, but each is a substituent), but wait, no, each CH3 is a methyl group attached to C1. So, each CH3 in (CH3)2C= is a substituent on C1. So, those are two substituents, each a CH3 group. So, each CH3 is a C connected to three H's.

But in terms of counting the total C atoms in the molecule, each CH3 adds a C. So, for (CH3)2C=CH-, the C1 is one C, each CH3 is another C each. So, (CH3)2C=CH- has 1 (C1) + 2 (from CH3) + 1 (C2, from =CH-) = 4 C atoms.

Similarly, in the CH=C(CH3)2 part, the C7 is one C, and each CH3 is another C each. So, C7 + 2 (from CH3) = 3 C's in that part.

So, let's count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C, 7 H.

2. CH2-: 1 C, 2 H (but as CH2- is connected, perhaps it has 2 H in the group).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the total number of C and H in the entire structure.

The entire structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C and H:

Each (CH3) group is a branch, so each contributes 1 C and 3 H.

So:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the main chain is:

C1 (from (CH3)2C=) → C2 (=CH-) → C3 (CH2-) → C4 (CH(CH3)-) → C5 (CH2-) → C6 (CH-) → C7 (=C(CH3)2).

Wait, that's seven Cs in the main chain.

Now, each (CH3) group adds a C and 3 H.

So, (CH3)2C=CH- → two CH3 groups attached to C1: adds 2 C and 6 H.

Similarly, CH(CH3)- → one CH3 group attached to C4: adds 1 C and 3 H.

And CH=C(CH3)2 → two CH3 groups attached to C7: adds 2 C and 6 H.

So, let's calculate:

Main chain C: 7.

Branches:

- (CH3)2: 2 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- (CH3)2 on C7: 2 C
Total branches: 2 +1 +2 =5 C.

So total C atoms: 7 +5 =12 C.

Wait, but in the main chain, each C is part of the main chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think differently.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent on the main chain's C.

So, the main chain has:

C1 (connected to two CH3 groups)

C2 (connected to C1 via double bond)

C3 (CH2)

C4 (CH(CH3))

C5 (CH2)

C6 (CH)

C7 (connected via double bond to C6, and has two CH3 groups)

So, main chain: 7 C.

Each CH3 group is a substituent, each adding one C and three H.

So, the substituents:

- C1 has two CH3: 2 C, 6 H
- C4 has one CH3: 1 C, 3 H
- C7 has two CH3: 2 C,6 H.

So, substituent C: 2 +1 +2 =5 C.

Total C: 7 (main) +5 (substituent) = 12 C.

Now, hydrogens.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H each. So:

(2 CH3 on C1) → 2 *3=6 H

(1 CH3 on C4) → 3 H

(2 CH3 on C7) → 2*3=6 H

Main chain H:

Each C in the main chain:

C1: (CH3)2C= → each CH3 gives 3 H, but since it's (CH3)2, that's 6 H. But wait, the central C (C1) is connected to the two CH3 groups, so those 6 H are part of the substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each H in all parts.

Main chain:

C1: (CH3)2C= → the central C is connected to three substituents: two CH3 and a double bond. So, no H's on C1 except from substituents.

C2: =CH- → this is CH with one H (since it's double bonded to C1 and connected to C3).

C3: CH2 → connected to C2 and C4. So, two H's on C3.

C4: CH(CH3) → connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 substituent. So, one H on C4.

C5: CH2 → connected to C4 and C6. Two H's.

C6: CH → connected to C5 and C7 via double bond. One H.

C7: C(CH3)2 → connected to C6 via double bond and has two CH3 substituents. No H's on C7, except from substituents.

So, main chain H:

C2: 1 H

C3: 2 H

C4: 1 H

C5: 2 H

C6: 1 H

So, main chain H: 1+2+1+2+1 =7 H.

Substituent H:

Each substituent CH3 contributes 3 H.

Number of substituent CH3 groups:

C1: 2 → 2*3=6 H

C4: 1 → 3 H

C7: 2 → 6 H

Total substituent H: 6+3+6=15 H.

So, total H in molecule: main chain 7 + substituent 15 → 22 H.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's from the main chain.

Wait, each CH2 group has two H's. Let me check each main chain C again for any H's.

C1: (CH3)2C= → no H's on C1.

C2: =CH- → CH has one H.

C3: CH2 → two H's.

C4: CH(CH3) → one H.

C5: CH2 → two H's.

C6: CH → one H.

C7: no H on C7, but substituents have their own H.

So, main chain H is 1+2+1+2+1 =7.

Substituent H: 15.

Total H: 22.

So, the compound has 12 C and 22 H atoms. So the molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, wait, 12 C and 22 H. Let me confirm:

12 C and 22 H → C12H22.

So, the molecular formula is C12H22.

Now, the next step is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (sum of bond energies in reactants) ] - [ (sum of bond energies in products) ]

The reactants are C (graphite) and H2 (gas). The products are the compound C12H22.

So, the sum of bond energies in reactants is the sum of all C-C bonds in graphite and all H-H bonds in H2.

The sum of bond energies in products is the sum of all bonds in C12H22, which includes C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So, let's compute each part.

First, the reactants:

Each mole of C (graphite) as reactant contributes a certain number of C-C bonds. The problem says that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. The atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) into gaseous C atoms. So, the total bond energy in one mole of C (graphite) is 1000 kJ.

But in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is (3/2) moles (since each bond is shared between two C atoms).

So, the bond energy for C-C in graphite for one mole of C is (3/2)*200 kJ/mol = 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the problem gives the bond energy of C-C as 200 kJ/mol. So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of C-C bonds in one mole of C (graphite). Let me think: the structure of graphite is a network of C-C bonds, each C bonded to three others. So, for each C atom, three C-C bonds, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is (3/2) moles.

So, the total bond energy for C in the reactant (graphite) is (3/2)*200 kJ/mol = 300 kJ.

Wait, but each mole of C has (3/2) moles of C-C bonds, each with bond energy 200 kJ. So, per mole of C, 300 kJ.

Similarly, for each mole of H2, we have one mole of H-H bonds, each with bond energy 100 kJ.

Now, the compound has 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms.

So, the number of H2 molecules needed to make 22 H atoms is 22/2 =11 moles of H2.

So, the sum of bond energies in the reactants is:

(C) → 12 moles × 300 kJ/mol (since each C contributes 300 kJ for its C-C bonds in graphite)

Plus,

(H2) → 11 moles × 100 kJ/mol (each H2 contributes one H-H bond of 100 kJ).

Wait, but wait, no. Because each mole of C (graphite) has 300 kJ of C-C bond energy. So, 12 moles of C would contribute 12 × 300 =3600 kJ.

Each H2 contributes 100 kJ, and 11 moles of H2 contribute 11 ×100=1100 kJ.

So, total reactant bond energy: 3600 + 1100 =4700 kJ.

Now, the product's bond energy: sum of all bonds in C12H22.

We need to count all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, let's count each type of bond.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count the bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- part:

- The central C (C1) is connected via double bond to C2.
- C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C-C single bonds).
- C2 is connected to C1 (double bond) and to C3 via a single bond.

2. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 part:

- C3 is connected to C2 and C4 via single bonds.
- C4 is connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 group (single bond).
- C5 is connected to C4 and C6 via single bonds.
- C6 is connected to C5 via single bond and to C7 via double bond.
- C7 is connected to C6 (double bond) and two CH3 groups (single bonds).

Now, let's count each bond type.

C=C bonds: in the structure, there are two double bonds.

Wait, in the given structure, the molecule has two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

So, two C=C bonds.

C-C single bonds:

Each single bond between C atoms in the main chain, and each single bond connecting substituents.

Let me count each C-C single bond:

Looking at the main chain:

C1-C2: double bond (so not counted as single).
C2-C3: single → 1
C3-C4: single → 1
C4-C5: single →1
C5-C6: single →1
C6-C7: double bond (not counted as single).

So, four C-C single bonds in the main chain.

Additionally, each substituent contributes C-C bonds:

Each (CH3) group is a C connected to the main chain C via a single bond. So each substituent adds a C-C single bond.

So, substituents:

C1 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.
C4 has one CH3 group → one C-C bond.
C7 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

So substituent C-C bonds: 2 +1 +2 =5.

So total C-C single bonds: main chain (4) + substituent (5) →9.

Each C-C single bond has bond energy 200 kJ/mol.

So, C-C bonds contribute 9 × 200 = 1800 kJ.

C=C bonds: two double bonds, each 300 kJ → 2 ×300=600 kJ.

C-H bonds:

Each C connected to H contributes a C-H bond.

Let me count the C-H bonds.

Looking at each C:

C1: (CH3)2 → 2 ×3 H (wait, each CH3 has three H, but connected to C1. So C1 is connected to 6 H via C-H bonds.

Wait no, each CH3 is a substituent, so C1 is connected to two CH3 groups, each contributing three H, but each C-H bond is a single bond. So, each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is a substituent on C1. So, each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. But since there are two CH3 groups, that's 6 C-H bonds.

Similarly:

C2: =CH- → one C-H bond.

C3: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C4: CH(CH3) → one C-H bond (since it's CH with a substituent).

C5: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C6: CH → one C-H bond.

C7: C(CH3)2 → no C-H bonds on C7, but each substituent CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups → 6 C-H bonds.

So, let's count each C-H bond:

C1: 2 CH3 → 2×3=6 bonds.

C2: 1 bond.

C3: 2 bonds.

C4: 1 bond.

C5: 2 bonds.

C6: 1 bond.

C7: 2 CH3 → 2×3=6 bonds.

So total C-H bonds:6 +1 +2 +1 +2 +1 +6 =19.

Wait, 6 (C1) +1 (C2) =7; then +2 (C3)=9; +1 (C4)=10; +2 (C5)=12; +1 (C6)=13; +6 (C7)=19.

So 19 C-H bonds.

Each C-H bond has bond energy 400 kJ/mol.

So, C-H bonds contribute 19 ×400 =7600 kJ.

Now, summing all bonds in the product:

C-C: 1800 kJ

C=C:600 kJ

C-H:7600 kJ

Total bonds in product: 1800 +600 +7600 = 10,000 kJ.

Wait, 1800 +600 is 2400, plus 7600 is 10,000 kJ.

So, the product's total bond energy is10,000 kJ.

Now, the reactant's total bond energy is4700 kJ (as calculated earlier: 3600 from C and 1100 from H2).

So, the enthalpy change ΔHf° is reactant bonds - product bonds.

ΔHf° =4700 kJ -10,000 kJ = -5300 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's a negative value, which would imply an exothermic formation. But looking at the options, none of them are in the -5000 range. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of bonds.

Let me recount the product bonds.

C-C single bonds: earlier I thought 9.

Wait, let me recount:

Main chain C-C single bonds:

C2-C3 →1

C3-C4 →1

C4-C5 →1

C5-C6 →1

So that's four.

Substituent C-C bonds:

C1 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

C4 has one CH3 → one C-C bond.

C7 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

Total substituent C-C:5.

So, main chain C-C:4, substituent C-C:5 →9.

So that's correct.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:19.

So, 9×200=1800, 2×300=600, 19×400=7600.

Total: 1800+600=2400 +7600=10,000 kJ.

Reactant bonds:12×300 (for C) +11×100 (for H2) →3600 +1100=4700.

So, 4700 -10,000 = -5300 kJ.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So I'm definitely making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the enthalpy of atomization is not the same as the bond energy of C-C in graphite. Because the atomization energy is the energy needed to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) to make C atoms. So, the bond energy is the sum of all C-C bonds in the element (graphite) per mole of C.

Wait, for C, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. That is, the energy required to break all C-C bonds in a mole of C (graphite) into gaseous C atoms.

So, the sum of bond energies in the reactants should be:

12 moles of C ×1000 kJ/mol (since each C in graphite requires 1000 kJ to atomize).

Wait, wait, that would be:

C:12 ×1000=12,000 kJ.

H2: 11 ×100 =1100 kJ.

So, total reactant bond energy:12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ.

Then, product's bond energy:10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=13,100 -10,000=3,100 kJ/mol.

But that's 3100 kJ/mol, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the approach. Maybe the problem expects me to use the given bond energies directly, without considering the C-C bond in graphite.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation by considering the bonds in the compound and the bonds in the elements (H2 and C).

Wait, the formula is: ΔHf = [sum of bonds broken in elements] - [sum of bonds formed in compound].

So, bonds broken in elements:

For C, each C in graphite has bonds broken. The number of C-C bonds per C is 3/2, as before. So per mole of C, bond energy is 300 kJ.

So, 12 moles of C →12 ×300=3600 kJ.

For H2: each H2 has one H-H bond. So 11 moles of H2 →11 ×100=1100 kJ.

Total bonds broken in elements:3600 +1100=4700 kJ.

Bonds formed in compound:

As before, 9×200=1800 (C-C), 2×300=600 (C=C), 19×400=7600 (C-H).

Total:10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=4700 -10,000= -5300 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should not use the enthalpy of atomization for C but instead use the given bond energies for C-C and C=C.

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for C-C (200), C=C (300), C-H (400), and H-H (100).

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the enthalpy of formation using:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ].

Wait, but the problem only gives the enthalpy of atomization for C, not for H. Oh, but the bond energy for H-H is given as 100.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization for H is the same as the bond energy of H-H, which is 100 kJ/mol per mole of bond. So, each H atom's enthalpy of atomization would be 50 kJ (since each H-H bond breaks into two H atoms, so 100 kJ per mole of bond → 50 kJ per mole of H atoms).

Wait, because for H2, each mole of H-H bond has 100 kJ. Breaking H2 into 2 H atoms requires 100 kJ per mole of H2. So per H atom, it's 50 kJ.

So, the enthalpy of atomization for H is 50 kJ/mol.

So, for the compound, the total enthalpy of atomization would be:

(12 ×1000) + (22 ×50) =12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ.

Then, subtract the sum of bond energies in the compound (10,000 kJ):

ΔHf=13,100 -10,000=3,100 kJ/mol.

This matches the earlier result of 3100 kJ, which isn't an option.

Hmm. But the options don't include this. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility is that the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. Looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g and D is 1900 kJ/g.

So, perhaps the answer is in kJ per gram, not per mole.

So, let's calculate the molar mass of the compound.

The compound is C12H22.

Molar mass:12×12 +22×1 =144 +22=166 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 3100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 3100 /166 ≈18.61 kJ/g.

But that's not matching any options. Option D is 1900, which is way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the sum of the bonds in the compound.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) – (sum of bond energies in products)

But the reactants are the elements in their standard states.

So, for C, the bond energy is the C-C bond in graphite. For H2, it's the H-H bond.

So, the total bond energy of the reactants is:

(12 × (3/2 ×200)) + (11 ×100) =12×300 +1100=3600+1100=4700.

Product's bond energy:10,000 as before.

ΔHf=4700-10,000= -5300 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

ΔHf = [ sum of bonds in products ] – [ sum of bonds in reactants ].

Which would be 10,000 –4700=5300.

But that's positive. Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm counting the bonds incorrectly.

Let me recount the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the product.

Another approach: Let's write the structure and count each bond.

The structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each double bond is a C=C.

Count C-C single bonds:

Each CH2 group contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH(CH3) contributes one C-C bond.

Each CH3 substituent contributes one C-C bond.

So, perhaps I should count each C-C single bond:

Let me list the structure and count each single C-C bond.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking at each C and their connections:

C1 (CH3)2C= → connected to C2 (double bond) and two CH3 groups.

C2= → connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

C3-CH2 → connected to C2 and C4.

C4-CH(CH3) → connected to C3, C5, and a CH3 group.

C5-CH2 → connected to C4 and C6.

C6-CH- → connected to C5 and C7 (double bond).

C7=C(CH3)2 → connected to C6 (double bond) and two CH3 groups.

So, single C-C bonds:

C1-C3: No, because C1 is connected to C2 via double bond.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

The molecule has:

- Two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

The main chain has:

C1 (CH3)2C= — C2 =CH— C3 — C4 — C5 — C6 — C7=C(CH3)2.

In this main chain:

C2 is double bonded to C1, single bonded to C3.

C3 is single bonded to C2 and C4.

C4 is single bonded to C3 and C5.

C5 is single bonded to C4 and C6.

C6 is single bonded to C5 and double bonded to C7.

So, the single C-C bonds in the main chain are:

C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 → four bonds.

Each substituent:

C1 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

C4 has one CH3 → one C-C bond.

C7 has two CH3 → two C-C bonds.

So, substituent C-C bonds: 2 +1 +2 =5.

Main chain C-C bonds:4.

So, total C-C single bonds:4+5=9.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H bonds.

C1 has two CH3 →6.

C2 has one CH →1.

C3 has two CH2 → but C3 is CH2, so two H's → two C-H bonds.

C4 is CH(CH3) → one H on C4.

C5 is CH2 → two C-H bonds.

C6 is CH → one C-H bond.

C7 has no H on itself, but the two CH3 groups →6.

So, C-H bonds:6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C7) → total 19.

So, same as before.

So, the product's bonds are:

C-C:9×200=1800.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:19×400=7600.

Total 1800+600+7600=10,000.

Reactants:

For each C, the bond energy is 300 kJ (as calculated earlier: 3/2 ×200).

12 C →12×300=3600.

H2:11 ×100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:3600+1100=4700.

So, ΔHf=4700 –10,000=–5300 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the enthalpy of atomization and not considering the bond energies in the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies provided without considering the C-C bond in the element (graphite), which is perhaps not given.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, earlier I thought the formula is C12H22, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Let me recount the carbons and hydrogens.

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent.

Let me count each C:

Each (CH3) is one C.

(CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, C, and the adjacent C).

CH2 →1 C.

CH(CH3) →1 C.

CH2 →1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, and two CH3).

So, 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

Wait, that's 10 C. Did I count wrong earlier?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is 4 C, then CH2 (1 C), CH(CH3) (1 C), CH2 (1 C), CH=C(CH3)2 (3 C)—total 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

So, 10 C.

Hydrogens:

Each CH3 is 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Two CH3 →6 H.

- CH- has 1 H.

In CH2-: each has 2 H.

In CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, plus the substituent CH3 →3 H.

In CH2-: 2 H.

In CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and two CH3→6 H.

Wait, perhaps a better way:

Main chain: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

- (CH3)2C=CH- →4 C, 7 H.

- CH2 →1 C, 2 H.

- CH(CH3) →1 C, 4 H (since CH(CH3) has one H and the substituent has 3 H).

- CH2 →1 C, 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C, 7 H (CH has 1 H, C=C has no H on the double bond, and two CH3 have 6 H).

So, total C:4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

H:

7 (from first part) +2 +4 +2 +7 →22 H.

So, the formula is C10H22.

Ah! Earlier, I mistakenly counted 12 C, but it's actually 10 C.

So, the correct molecular formula is C10H22.

So, this changes everything.

Now, recalculating:

Number of C atoms:10.

Number of H atoms:22.

So, the reactant bonds:

C:10 ×300=3000 kJ.

H:22/2=11 moles of H2 →11 ×100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:3000+1100=4100 kJ.

Product bonds:

C-C:9×200=1800.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:19×400=7600.

Total product bonds:1800+600+7600=10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900 kJ/mol.

Hmm, that's still not matching the options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of substituent C-C bonds.

Wait, with C10H22, let's recount substituent C-C bonds.

Main chain: C1 to C10? No, earlier I thought the main chain has 10 C? No, with C10H22, the main chain is likely shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product bond calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, such as using the enthalpy of atomization and not bond energies.

Wait, perhaps the formula to use is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ atomization energies of elements) ] – [ Σ bond energies in compound ]

So, for the compound:

Σ atomization energies = (10 ×1000) + (22 ×50) =10,000 + 1100=11,100 kJ.

Σ bond energies in compound=10,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf=11,100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either, but option A is 11200, which is close.

Wait, 11,100 kJ/mol would be 11,100, which is about 11,100, but option A is 11,200. Close, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24 instead of 22.

If H is 24, then:

Σ atomization energies =10×1000 +24×50=10,000 +1200=11,200.

Then, ΔHf=11,200 –10,000=1,200.

But option A is 11200, which would be 11,200. Hmm, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24.

Let me recount the H atoms.

Structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group has 3 H.

Let me count H again:

Main chain:

Each C in main chain:

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: =CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H (on C4) +3 H (from CH3 substituent) →4 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: =C(CH3)2 → no H on C7, but two CH3 substituents →6 H.

So, main chain H:6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +4 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C7) →6+1=7, +2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +1=16, +6=22.

So 22 H.

Hmm, so the initial count was correct. So, why is option A 11200? Because 10 C and 22 H gives 10,000 + (22×50)=10,000 +1100=11,100.

So, ΔHf=11,100–10,000=1,100.

Hmm, but option A is 11,200.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is different. Maybe the enthalpy of atomization is not used, but the bond energies of the elements are considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of bonds in the compound and subtract them from the bonds in the elements.

But I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g.

If I calculate the molar mass of C10H22, it's 10×12 +22×1=120 +22=142 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 1,100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1100 /142 ≈7.74 kJ/g, which is not an option. Alternatively, if it were 11,200 kJ/mol, per gram would be 11,200 /142≈79 kJ/g, also not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [Σ (elements' bond energies)] – [Σ (compound's bond energies)].

So, if the sum of elements' bonds is 4100 kJ (as for C10H22), and the compound's bonds are 10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000= -5900 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, and the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energies in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization for C, which is 1000 kJ/mol, and the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, for the compound, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of all C and H atoms, minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

So:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × 1000) + (number of H atoms × 50) ] – [ sum of bond energies in compound ]

Wait, because each H atom requires 50 kJ (half of H-H bond energy) to be atomized.

So, for C10H22:

ΔHf= [10×1000 +22×50] – [ sum of product bonds ]

=10,000 +1100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but option A is 11,200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. Let me recount.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C.

Each CH2 is 1 C.

Each CH(CH3) is 1 C.

Each CH2 is 1 C.

Each CH= is 1 C.

Each C(CH3)2 is 1 C.

Wait, that's 4 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I'm really confused. Let me try again.

The structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (two CH3, C, adjacent C).
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH(CH3) →1 C.
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, two CH3).

Wait, that's 4+1+1+1+3=10 C.

Hmm, but maybe the structure is symmetric, so perhaps the molecule has fewer C atoms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C10H22, which would have 10 C and 22 H.

So, recalculating:

ΔHf= [10×1000 +22×50 ] – 10,000 = (10,000 +1,100) –10,000 =1,100 kJ/mol.

But option A is 11,200, which is 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using per mole of compound, but the answer is per mole of C or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation per mole of C, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies as per bond, not per mole.

Wait, no, the given bond energies are per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound using the given bond energies, but without considering the C-C bonds in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) – (sum of bond energies in compound).

But the elements are H2 and C.

Each C in the compound came from C in graphite, which has C-C bonds with energy 200 kJ per mole.

Each H2 has H-H bonds of 100 kJ per mole.

So, for the compound:

Number of C atoms:10.

So, 10 × (3/2 ×200) =10 ×300=3000 kJ.

Number of H atoms:22 →11 H2 molecules →11 ×100=1100 kJ.

Total reactant bonds:3000 +1100=4100 kJ.

Product bonds:10,000 kJ.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900 kJ/mol.

But this is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol. How?

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the number of C and H in the compound and use only the given bond energies.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) – (sum of bond energies in compound).

But perhaps the elements are considered as C (atomized) and H (atomized), not as H2.

So, for each C atom, the bond energy is 1000 kJ (atomization).

For each H atom, the bond energy is 50 kJ (since H-H is 100 kJ per mole, so per H atom, 50 kJ).

So, for the compound C10H22:

Σ atomization energies =10×1000 +22×50=10,000 +1100=11,100 kJ.

Σ bond energies in compound=10,000 kJ.

ΔHf=11,100 –10,000=1,100 kJ/mol.

But 1,100 kJ/mol is 1100, not 11200.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the enthalpy of atomization of the compound itself, but that's not the same as the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given bond energies are per bond, not per mole.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

Bond energies given are per mole. So, for example, C-C is 200 kJ/mol.

So, perhaps the approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8 instead of 9.

Let me recount C-C bonds:

In the structure, main chain C-C bonds:

C2-C3:1

C3-C4:1

C4-C5:1

C5-C6:1

So, four.

Substituent C-C bonds:

C1 has two CH3 → two.

C4 has one CH3 → one.

C7 has two CH3 → two.

Total substituent C-C:5.

Main chain:4.

Total C-C:9.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering each C=C double bond as two C-C bonds. So, for each C=C, it's two C-C single bonds.

If that's the case, then each C=C contributes two C-C bonds, each with 200 kJ. So, two C=C bonds would contribute 4×200=800 kJ.

Wait, but that's not how bond energies work. Each double bond is a C=C, which has a bond energy of 300 kJ per mole. So, it's not equivalent to two single bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization but also considering the triple bonds or other factors, but that's unlikely.

Given that I'm stuck and the options don't match my calculations, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24, making the formula C10H24.

Then, the sum would be:

10×1000 +24×50=10,000 +1200=11,200.

ΔHf=11,200 –10,000=1,200 kJ/mol.

Which is 1200, but option A is 11200.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule as a whole, but I'm not counting the bonds correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each double bond contributes to the bond count.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have counted the C=C bonds as two C-C bonds each, leading to more C-C bonds.

But that would change the calculations.

But I think I'm at an impasse here, as I can't find a way to get any of the options to match. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, but 67.4 is much smaller than the numbers I've been getting. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach leads to option B.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies in reactants) ] – [ (Σ bond energies in products) ]

But earlier calculations gave -5300 or -5900, which don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation per gram, and I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, molar mass of C10H22 is 10×12 +22×1=120+22=142 g/mol.

If ΔHf is 1100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1100 /142 ≈7.74 kJ/g, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if the ΔHf is 11,100 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 11,100 /142 ≈78.17 kJ/g, which isn't an option either.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that number.

Wait, 67.4 kJ/mol is approximately 67400 J/mol. If I have 10,000 kJ for product bonds and 10,000 – 67400= negative, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the bond energies in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies in product) ] – [ (Σ bond energies in reactants) ]

Which would give 10,000 –4100=5900 kJ/mol.

But that's positive 5900, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies.

Wait, the bond energies are:

C-C:200 kJ/mol.

C=C:300 kJ/mol.

C-H:400 kJ/mol.

H-H:100 kJ/mol.

Enthalpy of atomization of C:1000 kJ/mol.

So, for C, each mole of C in graphite contributes 300 kJ (3/2 ×200) as earlier.

So, for 10 C: 10 ×300=3000.

H2:22/2=11 moles →11 ×100=1100.

Total reactants:4100.

Products:10,000.

ΔHf=4100 –10,000=–5900.

But this is negative, which is exothermic. The options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the enthalpy of atomization and then subtract the bond energies of the compound.

Which would be:

ΔHf= (10×1000 +22×50) – (10,000 )=11,100 –10,000=1,100.

But this is 1,100, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the number of bonds in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I'm counting the C-H bonds incorrectly. Let me recount.

Each (CH3) group has 3 C-H bonds.

C1 has two (CH3) →6.

C2 has one CH →1.

C3 has CH2 →2.

C4 has CH(CH3) →1.

C5 has CH2 →2.

C6 has CH →1.

C7 has two (CH3) →6.

Adding them up:6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +6=19.

So correct count is 19.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is intended to have a different answer. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, 67.4 is approximately 67400 J/mol. If the ΔHf is 67,400 J/mol =67.4 kJ/mol.

How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the number of C and H is different. Suppose the formula is C8H14.

Then:

Σ atomization:

8×1000 +14×50=8000 +700=8700.

Σ product bonds: ?

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the compound to be something else, but the structure given is different.

In any case, I'm stuck and perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The structure was analyzed, and the molecular formula was determined to be **C10H22**. This was verified by counting the carbons and hydrogens in the structure.

2. **Calculate the total bond energies in the compound**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 9 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 19 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 7600 kJ.  
   - **Total bond energy in the compound**:  
     \[
     1800 + 600 + 7600 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total bond energies in the reactants (elements)**:  
   - For carbon (graphite): Each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize. Since the compound contains 10 carbons, the total energy for carbon is:  
     \[
     10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
   - For hydrogen: Each mole of H-H bonds requires 100 kJ/mol. The compound contains 22 hydrogens, which corresponds to 11 moles of H2:  
     \[
     11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
   - **Total bond energy in the reactants**:  
     \[
     10,000 + 1100 = 11,100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Sum of bond energies in reactants} - \text{Sum of bond energies in products}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 11,100 - 10,000 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Convert to per gram (if necessary)**:  
   The molar mass of the compound is:  
   \[
   10 \times 12 + 22 \times 1 = 142 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   The enthalpy of formation per gram is:  
   \[
   \frac{1,100}{142} \approx 7.74 \, \text{kJ/g}.
   \]

6. **Compare with the options**:  
   None of the calculated values (1,100 kJ/mol or 7.74 kJ/g) match the provided options. However, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** was considered as a potential answer, though the reasoning to reach this value was unclear. It is possible that the problem involves a different interpretation of bond energies or molecular structure.

**Final Answer**:  
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer from the given options is:  
**Answer: B**
