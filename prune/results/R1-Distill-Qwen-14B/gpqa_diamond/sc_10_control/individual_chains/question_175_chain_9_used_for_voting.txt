Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's somewhat shaped like a sphere but perhaps elongated along an axis. The symmetry axis here is the z-axis. Because the charge is oscillating, it will radiate energy, and this radiation has a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at an angle θ = 30 degrees, and what the possible form of f is. The options given are A to D, each with different fractions and power dependencies on λ.

Hmm, I remember that when charges accelerate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation has certain patterns depending on the setup. For a dipole antenna, for example, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis of the dipole. In this case, the symmetry is along the z-axis, so the radiation pattern will depend on θ.

I think about the radiation pattern of a dipole. The radiated power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So the maximum power occurs when cosθ is either 1 or -1, meaning θ is 0 or 180 degrees. At θ=90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis), the power is zero. Wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for a dipole. So the power is maximum along the axis, and minimum in the plane perpendicular to it.

Wait, but wait. So if that's the case, the maximum power occurs at θ=0 and θ=180 degrees. But in this question, they're asking about the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 degrees.

So, if the maximum power is A, then when θ is 30 degrees, the power is a fraction of A determined by the radiation pattern function.

Let me write down the function for the dipole radiation pattern. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So, the function f(θ) would be something like (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by some constants.

But wait, the question says that the power in the radiation zone is a function f(λ, θ). So, the function f must depend on both λ and θ. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the maximum power is A, so that would be the maximum value of f, which would occur at θ=0 or 180 degrees, where cosθ is +1 or -1. So, in those cases, cos²θ is 1, so f would be proportional to (1 + 1) = 2, perhaps.

Wait, but I should think about the exact form. So, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is given by the formula:

P(θ) = (p^2 sin²θ) / (something with λ and constants) ) * (some function of θ)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is given by a function that depends on (1 + cos²θ), so the intensity is proportional to that.

So, the maximum intensity is when cos²θ is 1, so 1+1=2, making the intensity 2 times some base value. At θ=30 degrees, cosθ is √3/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. Thus, (1 + 3/4) is 7/4. Wait, that can't be right because that would be higher than the maximum. Oh wait, no, wait no. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Because for a dipole, the radiation is strongest along the axis, but perhaps in the near field. Wait, no, the dipole's radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. A dipole antenna radiates most strongly in the plane perpendicular to its axis. So for a dipole along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is at θ=90 degrees. So the radiation pattern peaks at θ=90. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, perhaps I was mixing up the radiation from a dipole versus, say, a monopole.

Wait, yes, I think I made a mistake earlier. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should remember the radiation pattern formula. The radiation intensity for a dipole is given by:

I(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p_0^2 ω^4 sin²θ ) / ( 12 π c^3 )) ) * ( 1 + cos²θ )

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I remember that the (1 + cos²θ) term is present. So when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. So the intensity is proportional to 2 times sin²θ. Wait, but when θ is 0, sinθ is zero. So at θ=0, the intensity would be zero. That can't be right. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard radiation pattern of a dipole. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees. So, the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by sinθ, perhaps? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by:

u(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p₀² ω⁴ ) / (12 π c³) ) * sin²θ (1 + cos²θ )

In this case, when θ is 0 degrees, sinθ is 0, so u(θ)=0. When θ is 90 degrees, sinθ=1, and (1 + 0)=1, so u is maximum there.

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees. So, the maximum power A is when θ=90 degrees. Then, the question is about θ=30 degrees.

So, the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ (1 + cos²θ). So when θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 1/2, so sin²θ is 1/4. Cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 is 7/4.

Wait, so the intensity at θ=30 would be (1/4) * (7/4) = 7/16 times the maximum? Wait, wait, no. Because maximum is at θ=90, where sinθ=1 and (1 + cos²θ)=1 + 0=1. So the maximum is 1² * 1 =1. So at θ=30, it's (1/2)^2 * (1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = (1/4) * (1 + 3/4) = (1/4)*(7/4) = 7/16.

Wait, but that's the value of u(θ) relative to the maximum. So the fraction of A is 7/16 of A. But wait, none of the options have 7/16. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is just (1 + cos²θ), and the maximum is 2, occurring at θ=0 and 180 degrees. Wait, but then at θ=90, it's 1. So perhaps the maximum is 2, and the minimum is 0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating. So perhaps it's a dipole-like distribution, but maybe the radiation pattern is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the maximum power is A. So f(θ) must have a maximum at some θ. Let's say the maximum is at θ=0, then f(θ) = something that peaks there.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the far-field radiation pattern for a dipole. The radiation intensity for a dipole is maximum at θ=90 degrees, but perhaps in this problem, the maximum is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different type of charge distribution, but without more details, I have to make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radiation from a loop antenna, which has a different pattern. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f relates to the radiation pattern, which for certain symmetries has maximum at specific angles.

Wait, but let me think about the possible answers. The options for the fraction are 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, etc.

In the dipole case, the maximum is at 90 degrees, and at 0 degrees, the intensity is zero. So at 30 degrees, which is between 0 and 90, the intensity is some fraction.

Wait, but earlier I calculated 7/16 as the fraction, which is 0.4375. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is (sinθ)^m, where m is related to the multipole moment. For a dipole, m=1, so maybe f is proportional to sinθ or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total power radiated is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. The maximum intensity A is the maximum value of f(θ), so when you integrate f(θ) over all solid angles, you get the total power.

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the fraction at a specific angle, but perhaps that's a way to think about it.

Wait, perhaps the given function f has a certain angular dependence, and the problem wants to know which option correctly matches the fraction and the λ dependence.

Looking at the options, the power per unit solid angle could depend on λ. For a dipole, I think the intensity is proportional to 1/λ^4. Because the dipole moment p has dimensions, and the radiation depends on p^2, and since p is related to the charge and frequency, perhaps through λ. Wait, let me think.

The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to p^2 ω^4. Since ω is 2πc/λ, so ω^4 is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be proportional to 1/λ^4.

So looking at the options, the λ dependence is either λ^-4, λ^-3, etc.

Looking at the options, options A and C have λ^-4, B has λ^-3, D has λ^-6.

So if the function f depends on λ^-4, then options A and C are possible for the λ part.

Now, the fraction of the maximum power A at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, earlier I thought that for a dipole, the intensity at θ=30 degrees would be (1 + cos²30)/something, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), which peaks at θ=0 and 180, with maximum 2. So, at θ=30, cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 is 7/4, but wait, that's larger than the maximum, which can't be. So that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, maybe the function f is (sinθ)^2. Then, the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ=1. At θ=30, sinθ=1/2, so (1/2)^2=1/4. So the fraction would be 1/4 of the maximum.

Looking at the options, option C has fraction 1/4 and λ^-4. Wait, option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. So that might fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought for a dipole, the function f is (1 + cos²θ), but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps for a different kind of charge distribution, the function f is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, another approach: for a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps the radiation is dipole-like. So maybe the angular dependence is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (sinθ)^2, which would give maximum at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction at θ=30 degrees. If the function is (sin²θ), then at θ=30, it's (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the fraction of the maximum (which occurs at 90) would be 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, and the λ dependence is λ^-4, so option C.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. If the function is (sin²θ), the maximum is 1, and at θ=30, it's 1/4, so the fraction is 1/4.

So, the fraction would be 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to λ^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is (1/4, λ^-4), option B is (1/4, λ^-3). So I think option C is correct.

But wait, I thought for a dipole, the function f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but that would make the maximum at θ=0 and 180, which would give f=2. Then, for θ=30, it's 1 + (3/4) = 7/4, which is higher than the maximum. That can't be right.

Oh wait, no. Wait, when θ=0, sinθ is zero, so if f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by something that's zero at θ=0, like sinθ.

Wait, perhaps the function f is something like (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by sinθ.

Alternatively, perhaps f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) * sin²θ.

Wait, let me think. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the formula:

E(θ) ∝ (1 + cos²θ)

But I think the intensity is proportional to E squared, so that would be (1 + cos²θ)^2. No, wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the radiation intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole is given by:

u(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p_0² ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3) ) * sin²θ (1 + cos²θ )

In that case, at θ=0, sinθ is zero, so u(θ) is zero. At θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, and (1 + cos²90) = 1 + 0 =1. So the maximum intensity is at θ=90, where u(θ)= sin²90 * (1+0) * (other constants) =1.

At θ=30 degrees:

sinθ = 1/2 → sin²θ = 1/4.

cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 → cos²θ = 3/4 → 1 + cos²θ = 7/4.

So u(30) = (1/4) * (7/4) =7/16.

So the fraction would be 7/16 of the maximum A. But that's not one of the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a dipole. Maybe it's a quadrupole or a different configuration. Or perhaps the maximum occurs elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the function f is proportional to cos^4θ. Then, at θ=30 degrees, cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos^4θ is (9/16). The maximum would be at θ=0, where cos^4θ=1.

But that would make the fraction at 30 degrees 9/16, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is (sinθ)^4. Then, at θ=30, sinθ=1/2, so (1/2)^4=1/16. But that's even smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4)

B) 1/4, λ^(-3)

C) 1/4, λ^(-4)

D) 3/4, λ^(-6)

If the function's angular dependence is (1 + cos²θ), the maximum is at θ=0 and 180, and at θ=30, the fraction would be (1 + cos^2(30)) / (max, which is 2) → (1 + 3/4)/2 = (7/4)/2 =7/8. That's 0.875, which isn't an option.

But that can't be right because at θ=30, the fraction is higher than the maximum. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (1 - cos^2θ) = sin^2θ. Then, the maximum is at θ=90 (sin^2=1). At θ=30, sin^2 is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, which matches option C.

And since the power per solid angle for a dipole is proportional to 1/λ^4, option C would have the correct λ dependence.

So, I think the correct answer is option C: fraction 1/4, λ^-4.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum radiated power \( A \) at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and identify the form of the radiated power per unit solid angle, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating dipole-like charge distribution, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 1/2 \), so \( \sin^2\theta = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Wavelength Dependence**:  
   The power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution is proportional to \( 1/\lambda^4 \). This arises because the radiation depends on the square of the dipole moment \( p \), and \( p \) is related to the frequency (or wavelength \( \lambda \)) of the oscillation. Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).  
   - **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).  
   - **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction of power and the wavelength dependence.  
   - **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of power is \( 1/4 \), and the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the radiated power per unit solid angle scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's somewhat shaped like a sphere but perhaps elongated along an axis. The symmetry axis here is the z-axis. Because the charge is oscillating, it will radiate energy, and this radiation has a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at an angle θ = 30 degrees, and what the possible form of f is. The options given are A to D, each with different fractions and power dependencies on λ.

Hmm, I remember that when charges accelerate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation has certain patterns depending on the setup. For a dipole antenna, for example, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis of the dipole. In this case, the symmetry is along the z-axis, so the radiation pattern will depend on θ.

I think about the radiation pattern of a dipole. The radiated power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So the maximum power occurs when cosθ is either 1 or -1, meaning θ is 0 or 180 degrees. At θ=90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis), the power is zero. Wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for a dipole. So the power is maximum along the axis, and minimum in the plane perpendicular to it.

Wait, but wait. So if that's the case, the maximum power occurs at θ=0 and θ=180 degrees. But in this question, they're asking about the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 degrees.

So, if the maximum power is A, then when θ is 30 degrees, the power is a fraction of A determined by the radiation pattern function.

Let me write down the function for the dipole radiation pattern. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So, the function f(θ) would be something like (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by some constants.

But wait, the question says that the power in the radiation zone is a function f(λ, θ). So, the function f must depend on both λ and θ. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the maximum power is A, so that would be the maximum value of f, which would occur at θ=0 or 180 degrees, where cosθ is +1 or -1. So, in those cases, cos²θ is 1, so f would be proportional to (1 + 1) = 2, perhaps.

Wait, but I should think about the exact form. So, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is given by the formula:

P(θ) = (p^2 sin²θ) / (something with λ and constants) ) * (some function of θ)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is given by a function that depends on (1 + cos²θ), so the intensity is proportional to that.

So, the maximum intensity is when cos²θ is 1, so 1+1=2, making the intensity 2 times some base value. At θ=30 degrees, cosθ is √3/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. Thus, (1 + 3/4) is 7/4. Wait, that can't be right because that would be higher than the maximum. Oh wait, no, wait no. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Because for a dipole, the radiation is strongest along the axis, but perhaps in the near field. Wait, no, the dipole's radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. A dipole antenna radiates most strongly in the plane perpendicular to its axis. So for a dipole along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is at θ=90 degrees. So the radiation pattern peaks at θ=90. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, perhaps I was mixing up the radiation from a dipole versus, say, a monopole.

Wait, yes, I think I made a mistake earlier. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should remember the radiation pattern formula. The radiation intensity for a dipole is given by:

I(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p_0^2 ω^4 sin²θ ) / ( 12 π c^3 )) ) * ( 1 + cos²θ )

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I remember that the (1 + cos²θ) term is present. So when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. So the intensity is proportional to 2 times sin²θ. Wait, but when θ is 0, sinθ is zero. So at θ=0, the intensity would be zero. That can't be right. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard radiation pattern of a dipole. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees. So, the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by sinθ, perhaps? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by:

u(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p₀² ω⁴ ) / (12 π c³) ) * sin²θ (1 + cos²θ )

In this case, when θ is 0 degrees, sinθ is 0, so u(θ)=0. When θ is 90 degrees, sinθ=1, and (1 + 0)=1, so u is maximum there.

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees. So, the maximum power A is when θ=90 degrees. Then, the question is about θ=30 degrees.

So, the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ (1 + cos²θ). So when θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 1/2, so sin²θ is 1/4. Cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 is 7/4.

Wait, so the intensity at θ=30 would be (1/4) * (7/4) = 7/16 times the maximum? Wait, wait, no. Because maximum is at θ=90, where sinθ=1 and (1 + cos²θ)=1 + 0=1. So the maximum is 1² * 1 =1. So at θ=30, it's (1/2)^2 * (1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = (1/4) * (1 + 3/4) = (1/4)*(7/4) = 7/16.

Wait, but that's the value of u(θ) relative to the maximum. So the fraction of A is 7/16 of A. But wait, none of the options have 7/16. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is just (1 + cos²θ), and the maximum is 2, occurring at θ=0 and 180 degrees. Wait, but then at θ=90, it's 1. So perhaps the maximum is 2, and the minimum is 0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating. So perhaps it's a dipole-like distribution, but maybe the radiation pattern is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the maximum power is A. So f(θ) must have a maximum at some θ. Let's say the maximum is at θ=0, then f(θ) = something that peaks there.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the far-field radiation pattern for a dipole. The radiation intensity for a dipole is maximum at θ=90 degrees, but perhaps in this problem, the maximum is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different type of charge distribution, but without more details, I have to make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radiation from a loop antenna, which has a different pattern. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f relates to the radiation pattern, which for certain symmetries has maximum at specific angles.

Wait, but let me think about the possible answers. The options for the fraction are 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, etc.

In the dipole case, the maximum is at 90 degrees, and at 0 degrees, the intensity is zero. So at 30 degrees, which is between 0 and 90, the intensity is some fraction.

Wait, but earlier I calculated 7/16 as the fraction, which is 0.4375. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is (sinθ)^m, where m is related to the multipole moment. For a dipole, m=1, so maybe f is proportional to sinθ or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total power radiated is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. The maximum intensity A is the maximum value of f(θ), so when you integrate f(θ) over all solid angles, you get the total power.

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the fraction at a specific angle, but perhaps that's a way to think about it.

Wait, perhaps the given function f has a certain angular dependence, and the problem wants to know which option correctly matches the fraction and the λ dependence.

Looking at the options, the power per unit solid angle could depend on λ. For a dipole, I think the intensity is proportional to 1/λ^4. Because the dipole moment p has dimensions, and the radiation depends on p^2, and since p is related to the charge and frequency, perhaps through λ. Wait, let me think.

The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to p^2 ω^4. Since ω is 2πc/λ, so ω^4 is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be proportional to 1/λ^4.

So looking at the options, the λ dependence is either λ^-4, λ^-3, etc.

Looking at the options, options A and C have λ^-4, B has λ^-3, D has λ^-6.

So if the function f depends on λ^-4, then options A and C are possible for the λ part.

Now, the fraction of the maximum power A at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, earlier I thought that for a dipole, the intensity at θ=30 degrees would be (1 + cos²30)/something, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), which peaks at θ=0 and 180, with maximum 2. So, at θ=30, cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos²θ is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 is 7/4, but wait, that's larger than the maximum, which can't be. So that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, maybe the function f is (sinθ)^2. Then, the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ=1. At θ=30, sinθ=1/2, so (1/2)^2=1/4. So the fraction would be 1/4 of the maximum.

Looking at the options, option C has fraction 1/4 and λ^-4. Wait, option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. So that might fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought for a dipole, the function f is (1 + cos²θ), but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps for a different kind of charge distribution, the function f is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, another approach: for a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps the radiation is dipole-like. So maybe the angular dependence is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (sinθ)^2, which would give maximum at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction at θ=30 degrees. If the function is (sin²θ), then at θ=30, it's (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the fraction of the maximum (which occurs at 90) would be 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, and the λ dependence is λ^-4, so option C.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. If the function is (sin²θ), the maximum is 1, and at θ=30, it's 1/4, so the fraction is 1/4.

So, the fraction would be 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to λ^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is (1/4, λ^-4), option B is (1/4, λ^-3). So I think option C is correct.

But wait, I thought for a dipole, the function f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but that would make the maximum at θ=0 and 180, which would give f=2. Then, for θ=30, it's 1 + (3/4) = 7/4, which is higher than the maximum. That can't be right.

Oh wait, no. Wait, when θ=0, sinθ is zero, so if f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by something that's zero at θ=0, like sinθ.

Wait, perhaps the function f is something like (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by sinθ.

Alternatively, perhaps f is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) * sin²θ.

Wait, let me think. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the formula:

E(θ) ∝ (1 + cos²θ)

But I think the intensity is proportional to E squared, so that would be (1 + cos²θ)^2. No, wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the radiation intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole is given by:

u(θ) = ( ( μ_0 p_0² ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3) ) * sin²θ (1 + cos²θ )

In that case, at θ=0, sinθ is zero, so u(θ) is zero. At θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, and (1 + cos²90) = 1 + 0 =1. So the maximum intensity is at θ=90, where u(θ)= sin²90 * (1+0) * (other constants) =1.

At θ=30 degrees:

sinθ = 1/2 → sin²θ = 1/4.

cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 → cos²θ = 3/4 → 1 + cos²θ = 7/4.

So u(30) = (1/4) * (7/4) =7/16.

So the fraction would be 7/16 of the maximum A. But that's not one of the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a dipole. Maybe it's a quadrupole or a different configuration. Or perhaps the maximum occurs elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the function f is proportional to cos^4θ. Then, at θ=30 degrees, cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos^4θ is (9/16). The maximum would be at θ=0, where cos^4θ=1.

But that would make the fraction at 30 degrees 9/16, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is (sinθ)^4. Then, at θ=30, sinθ=1/2, so (1/2)^4=1/16. But that's even smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4)

B) 1/4, λ^(-3)

C) 1/4, λ^(-4)

D) 3/4, λ^(-6)

If the function's angular dependence is (1 + cos²θ), the maximum is at θ=0 and 180, and at θ=30, the fraction would be (1 + cos^2(30)) / (max, which is 2) → (1 + 3/4)/2 = (7/4)/2 =7/8. That's 0.875, which isn't an option.

But that can't be right because at θ=30, the fraction is higher than the maximum. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is proportional to (1 - cos^2θ) = sin^2θ. Then, the maximum is at θ=90 (sin^2=1). At θ=30, sin^2 is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, which matches option C.

And since the power per solid angle for a dipole is proportional to 1/λ^4, option C would have the correct λ dependence.

So, I think the correct answer is option C: fraction 1/4, λ^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum radiated power \( A \) at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and identify the form of the radiated power per unit solid angle, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating dipole-like charge distribution, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 1/2 \), so \( \sin^2\theta = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Wavelength Dependence**:  
   The power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution is proportional to \( 1/\lambda^4 \). This arises because the radiation depends on the square of the dipole moment \( p \), and \( p \) is related to the frequency (or wavelength \( \lambda \)) of the oscillation. Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).  
   - **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).  
   - **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction of power and the wavelength dependence.  
   - **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of power is \( 1/4 \), and the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the radiated power per unit solid angle scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
