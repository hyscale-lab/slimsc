Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, so if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it's closer to its star. Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the mass of the star. So P² ∝ a³/(M_star). Since Planet_1's period is shorter, and assuming same mass for the star as Planet_2's, its a would be smaller. But wait, the stars have different masses. Oh, the question says the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So I need to factor that in.

Wait, but the stars have the same radii. So R_star1 = R_star2. Because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So R is same for both stars.

The probability of transit is given by the formula: P = (R_planet + R_star) / a. Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (as seen from the star) to the area of the star. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star, so the chance is that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The formula is usually approximated as (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but wait, another factor is the inclination. Oh right, the probability that the planet transits is roughly (R_star / a), assuming random inclinations. So the probability is inversely proportional to the orbital radius a.

So for each planet, I can compute this probability and compare.

Let me get the variables straight:

For Planet_1:

- Period P1 = P2 /3 (since P1 is three times shorter than Planet_2’s)
- Host star mass M1 = 2 * M2 (since M1 is twice that of M2)
- R1 = R2 (both stars have same radius)
- They have same mass, but that doesn't directly affect the transit probability, but it's given for other methods.

Wait, but to find a, the semi-major axis, I need to use Kepler's third law. So for each planet:

P² = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) ) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + m_p ≈ M_star.

So a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but for a given star and planet, a would be determined by the period. Because for a given P and M, a is determined.

So let me compute a1 and a2.

a1 = [ (G * M1 * P1² ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
Similarly, a2 = [ (G * M2 * P2² ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

But since Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 /3,

a1 = [ (G * (2 M2) * (P2² /9) ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9 * M2 * P2²) * G/(4π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) * (M2 P2²) ) * (G/(4π²)) ) ]^(1/3)

And a2 is [ (G * M2 * P2² ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3) * a2.

Because the rest of the terms are same for a1 and a2.

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222. So (2/9)^(1/3) is cube root of 0.222. Let me compute that.

Cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 0.125 is 0.5. 0.222 is about 0.222.

Let me compute 0.6^3 is 0.216, so cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6.

So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2.

Wait, wait, let me make this exact. Since a1 is proportional to (2/9)^(1/3) times a2.

But let me compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2 is 2^1, 9 is 3^2. So 2/9 = (2)/(3^2) = 2 *3^(-2).

So (2/9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3).

Alternatively, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period and the star is more massive, so the planet is closer.

Now, the transit probability is (R_star / a), so since both stars have same radius R.

So probability for Planet_1: P1 = R / a1.

Probability for Planet_2: P2 = R / a2.

We can find the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2. So the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 > P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred.

Option C: ~1.65 times higher. D is ~2.7.

So according to our calculation, the ratio is about 1.65 times, so option C.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's do the exact calculation.

We have a1 and a2.

a1 = (G * (2 M2) * (P1)^2 )^(1/3 ) / (something), but more accurately, a1^3 = [ G (2 M2) (P1)^2 ) ] / (4 π² )

But since P1 is P2 /3,

a1^3 = [ G (2 M2) (P2^2 /9) ) ] / (4 π² )

a2^3 = [ G M2 P2^2 ) ] / (4 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2 (P2²/9) ) ] / ( M2 P2² ) )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 (P2²/9) = (2/9) M2 P2².

Denominator: M2 P2².

So ratio is (2/9) M2 P2² / M2 P2² ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

2/9 is approximately 0.222.

Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6 times a2.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is R/(a1) = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = (5/3) * (R/a2).

Which is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2's probability.

So the ratio is approximately 1.666, which is 5/3 or about 1.67.

Looking at the options:

Option C: ~1.65 times higher.

So the correct answer is option C, Planet_1 is preferred, 1.65 times higher.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star1}} = R_{\text{star2}} \)), the probability of transit depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Calculation
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \( M_{\text{star1}} = 2M_{\text{star2}} \), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Planet_2: \( M_{\text{star2}} \), \( P_2 \)

The semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
a_1 \propto (M_{\text{star1}} P_1^2)^{1/3} = (2M_{\text{star2}} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.606 \), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). Thus, the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

The semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
