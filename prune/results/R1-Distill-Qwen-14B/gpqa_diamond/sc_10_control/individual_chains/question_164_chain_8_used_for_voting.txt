Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods between consecutive primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. So system_1 has a longer orbital period than system_2.

Then, looking at their radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocity is inversely proportional to mass.

Wait, right, the mass ratio comes into play. The more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. So the two velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are inversely proportional to the masses (M1 and M2). So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, I think. Or wait, maybe it's a different relation.

Wait, let me think again. The center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. Since velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius (v = ω a), and the orbital period is the same for both stars. So their velocities are proportional to their orbital radii. So v1 = (2π a1)/P, and v2 = (2π a2)/P. Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a, where a is the separation. So v1 = (2π (M2/(M1+M2)) a ) / P. Similarly for v2.

But also, from the mass ratio, M1 v1 = M2 v2. Because the center of mass doesn't accelerate, so M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Wait, so M1/M2 = v2/v1.

In system_1: velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say star A is the more massive one because it's moving less. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1 (primary) would have K1 = 5, and M2 has K2=10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the primary eclipse is when the hotter star is eclipsed. But that's not directly relevant to the velocities. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. So if in system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5, the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So the more massive star is the one with 5 km/s, and the other is less massive with 10 km/s. Wait, that can't be right. Because a less massive star would have a higher velocity since it's moving more around the center of mass.

Wait, no, the primary star is the more massive one, so its velocity would be lower. So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5. So which is which? If K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, then M1 (say, the primary) would have K2 = 5, so M1 = M2 * (K2 / K1).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of the mass ratio. Let me denote M1 as the mass of the first star, M2 the second. Their velocities are K1 and K2.

From the center of mass condition: M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1.

So the mass ratio is K2 over K1.

So for system_1:

M1/M2 = K2 / K1 = 5/10 = 0.5.

So the mass ratio is 0.5:1, which is 1:2. So M1 is half of M2. Wait, but wait, no—because the sum is the total mass.

Wait, the total mass of the system is M1 + M2.

Wait, but wait, in terms of the mass ratio, M1/M2 = 0.5, so M1 = 0.5 M2. So total mass is 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

But that's for system_1.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the individual masses in each system and then compare the total masses. Because the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So perhaps I need to compute (M1 + M2) for each system and then take the ratio.

Wait, no, the question says: system_1 is more massive than system_2 by what factor. So the factor is (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2). So we need to find (M1a + M2a) / (M1b + M2b), where a is system_1 and b is system_2.

Let me structure this.

For each system, I can find the mass ratio between the two stars, then compute the total mass ratio.

So for system_1:

M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5 / 10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So total mass of system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10 / 15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass of system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b ≈ 1.6667 M2b.

Wait, no, because in system_2, which star is which? Let me make sure.

In system_2, the two RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. So M1b is the mass of the star with velocity K1b=15, and M2b is the one with K2b=10.

Then, M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

So system_2's total mass is M1b + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the mass of system_1 is 1.5 M2a, and system_2 is (5/3) M2b.

So, the ratio of the masses is (1.5 M2a) / (5/3 M2b) ) = (1.5 * 3/5) * (M2a / M2b) ) = (4.5 /5) * (M2a/M2b) = 0.9 * (M2a/M2b).

Wait, but how do we relate M2a and M2b?

Hmm, maybe I need to bring in the orbital periods. Because the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. Also, the period is related to the masses and the separation.

Oh wait, Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to (a1 + a2)^3 / (M1 + M2), where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the two stars. But since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2 (from center of mass), so a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.

So Kepler's third law in binary systems: P^2 = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a^3) (M1 + M2). Wait, but the actual formula is P² = (4π² / G(M1 + M2)) ) * a³.

Wait, I think another approach is to use the formula that relates the velocities, periods, and masses.

We can write that for each star, the velocity is V = (2π a_i) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

And from the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocities are V1 = (2π a1)/P, V2 = (2π a2)/P.

So V1 = (2π a (M2/(M1+M2)) ) / P,

V2 = (2π a (M1/(M1+M2)) ) / P.

So V1 / V2 = M2 / M1.

Which matches our earlier conclusion that M1/M2 = V2/V1.

But how does this tie into the period?

We can rearrange the velocity expressions.

V1 = (2π a1)/P,

But a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a,

But a is the separation. Let me think about the total separation a.

In Kepler's third law, the period P is related to a³/(M1 + M2) with the gravitational constant.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K in terms of the masses and period.

The formula is: K = (2π G )^(1/3) ( (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 P ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + q)^2 )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the mass function can relate the observed velocities and the period.

Wait, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but without knowing the inclination angle i, which is usually unknown. But in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is ~1.

But I think in this problem, since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume i ≈ 90°, so sin i ≈ 1.

So the mass function f(M) = (M2³ ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G )

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get the formula correctly.

The mass function is f(M) = ( (K1)^3 P ) / (2 π G ) ) = ( M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2)^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each star, the mass can be expressed in terms of the other parameters.

I recall that for each star, M1 = (K2 * P) / (2π G) ) * ( (M1 + M2) )^2 )^(1/3) ) ??? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I can find the mass ratio and then find the total mass.

Because in each system, the two stars' velocities are known, so the mass ratio can be determined, and the total mass can be calculated from that.

Wait, but without knowing the actual separation or distance, can I find the total mass? Because the velocity amplitudes are given, but without knowing the actual distance, the velocities only give mass ratios, not absolute masses.

But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods. Do I need to use the period in the calculation?

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem says that the periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Are the periods the same as the orbital periods? Yes.

So for each system, the period P is known.

I think I can relate the velocities and the periods to the masses.

Let me denote for system_1:

K1a = 10 km/s,

K2a = 5 km/s,

P1 = 2 years.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1b =15 km/s,

K2b=10 km/s,

P2=1 year.

The mass function for a star in a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K * P )^3 ) / (2π G )

where K is the velocity semi-amplitude, and f(M) is in terms of the other star's mass.

Wait, no, the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K )^3 P ) / (2 π G )

and f(M) = ( M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since i ≈ 90°, sin i = 1.

So, for each star in each system, we can write f(M) for both stars.

Wait, but each star's mass function is dependent on the other star's mass.

But perhaps, given that the two stars in a system are orbiting each other, their mass functions are related.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express each star's mass in terms of the other.

Wait, let me think of each system.

For system_1:

M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So the total mass for system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10 /15 = 2/3.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass for system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But to find the ratio of the total masses, I need to relate M2a and M2b.

Hmm, perhaps I can find M2a and M2b in terms of the period.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a³) (M1 + M2).

Wait, but a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

But since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a,

and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a,

so a = a1 + a2 = a.

But perhaps using the formula that relates the velocity, period, and mass.

We can express the velocity as:

V = (2π a_i) / P,

so a_i = V * P/(2π).

But a1 + a2 = a.

But M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2,

a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

So a1 + a2 = (M2/M1 + 1) a2 = a.

Hmm, but perhaps substituting a1 and a2 in terms of V.

Because a1 = V1 * P/(2π),

a2 = V2 * P/(2π).

So a1 + a2 = (V1 + V2) * P/(2π) = a.

But also, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a,

a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So,

V1 = (2π a1) / P = (2π (M2/(M1 + M2)) a ) / P.

Similarly,

V2 = (2π a2) / P = (2π (M1/(M1 + M2)) a ) / P.

So, V1 / V2 = M2 / M1.

Which brings us back to the earlier mass ratio.

But how to tie this into the period.

Wait, I think we can use the fact that a³ / (M1 + M2) = G P² / (4 π² )

But a is the separation, which is a1 + a2.

But from the velocities,

a1 = (V1 P)/(2 π),

a2 = (V2 P)/(2 π).

So a = a1 + a2 = (V1 + V2) P/(2 π).

Substituting into the Kepler equation:

[ (V1 + V2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3 / (M1 + M2) = G P²/(4 π² )

Multiplying both sides by (M1 + M2):

[ (V1 + V2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3 = (G P²/(4 π² )) (M1 + M2)

Take cube of (V1 + V2) P/(2 π):

(V1 + V2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) ) = (G P² (M1 + M2) )/(4 π² )

Multiply both sides by 8 π^3:

(V1 + V2)^3 P^3 = 2 G π (M1 + M2) P^2

Divide both sides by P^2:

(V1 + V2)^3 P = 2 G π (M1 + M2)

So,

M1 + M2 = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P ) / (2 G π )

So now, the total mass can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

But wait, the velocities are given in km/s, the period in years. I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Let me compute M for each system using this formula.

First, let's convert the period from years to seconds.

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years.

1 year ≈ 3.154e7 seconds.

So P1 = 2 * 3.154e7 = 6.308e7 s.

V1a = 10 km/s = 10e3 m/s.

V2a = 5 km/s =5e3 m/s.

So V1a + V2a =15e3 m/s.

Compute (V1 + V2)^3 * P1:

(15e3)^3 = (3375e9) m^3/s^3.

Multiply by P1: 3375e9 * 6.308e7 = approx 2.124e17.

Now, denominator: 2 * G * π.

G is 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

So 2 * G * π ≈ 2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.198e-10.

So M1a + M2a = (2.124e17) / (4.198e-10 ) = approx 5.078e26 kg.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, (15e3)^3 = 3375e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1=6.308e7 s:

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 2.124e20 (m^3/s^2).

Wait, wait, no, (V^3) is (m/s)^3, multiplied by P in seconds: so units are (m^3/s^3) * s = m^3/s².

But denominator is 2 G π, which is in m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So the M will be in kg.

So:

(3.375e12 m³/s³) * (6.308e7 s) = 3.375e12 *6.308e7 = 2.124e20 m³/s².

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²) * π ≈ 4.195e-10 m³/(kg s²).

So M = (2.124e20) / (4.195e-10 ) kg.

Which is approximately 5.075e30 kg.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So a binary system with a total mass of 5e30 kg would be about twice the mass of the Sun. But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, (15e3)^3 = (15)^3 * (1e3)^3 = 3375 * 1e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1 (6.308e7 s):

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 3.375 *6.308e19 = approx 21.24e19 = 2.124e20 m³/s².

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 * π ≈ 4.195e-10.

So 2.124e20 / 4.195e-10 = approximately 5.075e29 kg.

Wait, 5e29 kg is about 25 solar masses, since the Sun is ~2e30 kg. So 5e29 is 0.25 solar masses. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 5e29 kg is 5e29 / 2e30 = 0.25 solar masses. That seems more reasonable for a binary system.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 * π.

= 2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416.

= 6.674e-11 * 6.2832 ≈ 4.191e-10.

So denominator is 4.191e-10.

So 2.124e20 / 4.191e-10 = approximately 5.075e29 kg.

Yes, that's about 0.25 solar masses.

Now, system_1's total mass is 0.25 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1b =15, K2b=10. So V1 + V2 =25e3 m/s.

P2=1 year = 3.154e7 s.

Compute (25e3)^3 =15625e9=1.5625e13 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P2=3.154e7 s:

1.5625e13 * 3.154e7 = approx 4.9206e20 m³/s².

Denominator same as before: 4.191e-10.

So M = 4.9206e20 /4.191e-10 = approx 1.174e30 kg.

Which is about 1.174e30 / 2e30 ≈ 0.587 solar masses.

So system_1 has a total mass of ~0.25 solar masses, system_2 ~0.587.

So system_1's mass is 0.25 / 0.587 ≈ 0.425 times system_2's mass.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Wait, the question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is 0.25 and system_2 is 0.587, then 0.25 /0.587 ≈0.425. So system_1 is approximately 0.425 times the mass of system_2. So it's about 0.4 times.

But the options have A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for system_1: M = (15e3)^3 * 6.308e7 / (2 * G * pi )

Wait, no, G is 6.674e-11.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute M1a + M2a:

(V1a + V2a)^3 * P1 / (2 * G * pi )

V1a + V2a =15e3 m/s.

Cube: (15e3)^3 = 3375e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1=6.308e7 s:

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 3.375 *6.308e(12+7) = 3.375 *6.308e19.

3.375 *6.308 ≈ 21.24.

So 21.24e19 = 2.124e20.

Divide by (2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 )

2 *6.674e-11 =1.3348e-10.

1.3348e-10 *3.1416≈4.193e-10.

So 2.124e20 /4.193e-10 = approx 5.075e29 kg.

Which is 5.075e29 / 1.988e30 kg (solar mass) ≈ 0.255 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2:

V1b + V2b=25e3 m/s.

Cube is (25e3)^3=1.5625e13 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P2=3.154e7 s:

1.5625e13 *3.154e7 =4.920625e20.

Divide by denominator 4.193e-10:

4.920625e20 /4.193e-10 ≈ 1.173e30 kg.

1.173e30 /1.988e30 ≈ 0.59 solar masses.

So system_1's mass is 0.255, system_2's is 0.59.

So system_1 is 0.255/0.59 ≈0.432 times as massive as system_2. So approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.4, option D is 0.7. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I calculated system_1's mass, I think I should have used the same formula but different velocities.

Wait, let me recheck the formula.

The formula I used was:

M = ( (V1 + V2)^3 * P ) / (2 * G * pi )

Yes, because I derived that M = (V1 + V2)^3 * P / (2 G pi )

So for system_1:

V1 + V2 = 15e3 m/s.

P=2 years = 6.308e7 s.

So M1 = (15e3)^3 * 6.308e7 / (2 * G * pi )

= (3375e9) * 6.308e7 / (4.193e-10 )

Wait, let me compute that:

3375e9 *6.308e7 =3375 *6.308e16 = 21.24e19 = 2.124e20.

Divided by 4.193e-10: 2.124e20 /4.193e-10 =5.075e29 kg.

Which is 0.255 solar masses.

For system_2:

V1 + V2 =25e3 m/s.

P=1 year =3.154e7 s.

So (25e3)^3 =1.5625e13.

Multiply by 3.154e7: 4.9206e20.

Divide by 4.193e-10: 4.9206e20 /4.193e-10 =1.173e30 kg =0.59 solar masses.

So system_1 is smaller in mass than system_2.

So the factor is 0.255/0.59 ≈ 0.432. So about 0.43. So the closest option is A) ~0.4.

But wait, the problem asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. But if system_1's mass is about 0.43 times system_2's, then it's less massive. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1. So the answer should be 0.4.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and masses in binary systems. The radial velocity semi-amplitudes, \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \), are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars: 

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{K_2}{K_1}.
\]

### Step 1: Mass Ratios for Each System
#### System_1:
- \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
- The mass ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{M_{1a}}{M_{2a}} = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5.
  \]
- Total mass of system_1:
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{2a} = 0.5 M_{2a} + M_{2a} = 1.5 M_{2a}.
  \]

#### System_2:
- \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
- The mass ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{M_{1b}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}.
  \]
- Total mass of system_2:
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1b} + M_{2b} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2b} + M_{2b} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2b}.
  \]

### Step 2: Relating Total Masses
To compare the total masses of the two systems, we use the derived expressions:
\[
M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_{2a}, \quad M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2b}.
\]
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 M_{2a}}{\frac{5}{3} M_{2b}} = \frac{1.5 \cdot 3}{5} \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{4.5}{5} \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = 0.9 \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}}.
\]

### Step 3: Using Orbital Periods
The orbital periods are \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \) for system_1 and \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \) for system_2. Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between velocities and periods, the masses can be expressed in terms of the observed velocities and periods. After detailed calculations, the total mass of system_1 is found to be approximately \( 0.255 \, M_\odot \), and the total mass of system_2 is approximately \( 0.59 \, M_\odot \).

### Step 4: Final Mass Ratio
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{0.255}{0.59} \approx 0.432.
\]
This value is closest to \( 0.4 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods between consecutive primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. So system_1 has a longer orbital period than system_2.

Then, looking at their radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocity is inversely proportional to mass.

Wait, right, the mass ratio comes into play. The more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. So the two velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are inversely proportional to the masses (M1 and M2). So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, I think. Or wait, maybe it's a different relation.

Wait, let me think again. The center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. Since velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius (v = ω a), and the orbital period is the same for both stars. So their velocities are proportional to their orbital radii. So v1 = (2π a1)/P, and v2 = (2π a2)/P. Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a, where a is the separation. So v1 = (2π (M2/(M1+M2)) a ) / P. Similarly for v2.

But also, from the mass ratio, M1 v1 = M2 v2. Because the center of mass doesn't accelerate, so M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Wait, so M1/M2 = v2/v1.

In system_1: velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say star A is the more massive one because it's moving less. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1 (primary) would have K1 = 5, and M2 has K2=10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the primary eclipse is when the hotter star is eclipsed. But that's not directly relevant to the velocities. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. So if in system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5, the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So the more massive star is the one with 5 km/s, and the other is less massive with 10 km/s. Wait, that can't be right. Because a less massive star would have a higher velocity since it's moving more around the center of mass.

Wait, no, the primary star is the more massive one, so its velocity would be lower. So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5. So which is which? If K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, then M1 (say, the primary) would have K2 = 5, so M1 = M2 * (K2 / K1).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of the mass ratio. Let me denote M1 as the mass of the first star, M2 the second. Their velocities are K1 and K2.

From the center of mass condition: M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1.

So the mass ratio is K2 over K1.

So for system_1:

M1/M2 = K2 / K1 = 5/10 = 0.5.

So the mass ratio is 0.5:1, which is 1:2. So M1 is half of M2. Wait, but wait, no—because the sum is the total mass.

Wait, the total mass of the system is M1 + M2.

Wait, but wait, in terms of the mass ratio, M1/M2 = 0.5, so M1 = 0.5 M2. So total mass is 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

But that's for system_1.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the individual masses in each system and then compare the total masses. Because the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So perhaps I need to compute (M1 + M2) for each system and then take the ratio.

Wait, no, the question says: system_1 is more massive than system_2 by what factor. So the factor is (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2). So we need to find (M1a + M2a) / (M1b + M2b), where a is system_1 and b is system_2.

Let me structure this.

For each system, I can find the mass ratio between the two stars, then compute the total mass ratio.

So for system_1:

M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5 / 10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So total mass of system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10 / 15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass of system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b ≈ 1.6667 M2b.

Wait, no, because in system_2, which star is which? Let me make sure.

In system_2, the two RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. So M1b is the mass of the star with velocity K1b=15, and M2b is the one with K2b=10.

Then, M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

So system_2's total mass is M1b + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the mass of system_1 is 1.5 M2a, and system_2 is (5/3) M2b.

So, the ratio of the masses is (1.5 M2a) / (5/3 M2b) ) = (1.5 * 3/5) * (M2a / M2b) ) = (4.5 /5) * (M2a/M2b) = 0.9 * (M2a/M2b).

Wait, but how do we relate M2a and M2b?

Hmm, maybe I need to bring in the orbital periods. Because the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. Also, the period is related to the masses and the separation.

Oh wait, Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to (a1 + a2)^3 / (M1 + M2), where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the two stars. But since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2 (from center of mass), so a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.

So Kepler's third law in binary systems: P^2 = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a^3) (M1 + M2). Wait, but the actual formula is P² = (4π² / G(M1 + M2)) ) * a³.

Wait, I think another approach is to use the formula that relates the velocities, periods, and masses.

We can write that for each star, the velocity is V = (2π a_i) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

And from the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocities are V1 = (2π a1)/P, V2 = (2π a2)/P.

So V1 = (2π a (M2/(M1+M2)) ) / P,

V2 = (2π a (M1/(M1+M2)) ) / P.

So V1 / V2 = M2 / M1.

Which matches our earlier conclusion that M1/M2 = V2/V1.

But how does this tie into the period?

We can rearrange the velocity expressions.

V1 = (2π a1)/P,

But a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a,

But a is the separation. Let me think about the total separation a.

In Kepler's third law, the period P is related to a³/(M1 + M2) with the gravitational constant.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K in terms of the masses and period.

The formula is: K = (2π G )^(1/3) ( (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 P ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + q)^2 )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the mass function can relate the observed velocities and the period.

Wait, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but without knowing the inclination angle i, which is usually unknown. But in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is ~1.

But I think in this problem, since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume i ≈ 90°, so sin i ≈ 1.

So the mass function f(M) = (M2³ ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G )

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get the formula correctly.

The mass function is f(M) = ( (K1)^3 P ) / (2 π G ) ) = ( M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2)^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each star, the mass can be expressed in terms of the other parameters.

I recall that for each star, M1 = (K2 * P) / (2π G) ) * ( (M1 + M2) )^2 )^(1/3) ) ??? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I can find the mass ratio and then find the total mass.

Because in each system, the two stars' velocities are known, so the mass ratio can be determined, and the total mass can be calculated from that.

Wait, but without knowing the actual separation or distance, can I find the total mass? Because the velocity amplitudes are given, but without knowing the actual distance, the velocities only give mass ratios, not absolute masses.

But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods. Do I need to use the period in the calculation?

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem says that the periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Are the periods the same as the orbital periods? Yes.

So for each system, the period P is known.

I think I can relate the velocities and the periods to the masses.

Let me denote for system_1:

K1a = 10 km/s,

K2a = 5 km/s,

P1 = 2 years.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1b =15 km/s,

K2b=10 km/s,

P2=1 year.

The mass function for a star in a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K * P )^3 ) / (2π G )

where K is the velocity semi-amplitude, and f(M) is in terms of the other star's mass.

Wait, no, the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K )^3 P ) / (2 π G )

and f(M) = ( M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since i ≈ 90°, sin i = 1.

So, for each star in each system, we can write f(M) for both stars.

Wait, but each star's mass function is dependent on the other star's mass.

But perhaps, given that the two stars in a system are orbiting each other, their mass functions are related.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express each star's mass in terms of the other.

Wait, let me think of each system.

For system_1:

M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So the total mass for system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b = 10 /15 = 2/3.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass for system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But to find the ratio of the total masses, I need to relate M2a and M2b.

Hmm, perhaps I can find M2a and M2b in terms of the period.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a³) (M1 + M2).

Wait, but a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

But since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a,

and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a,

so a = a1 + a2 = a.

But perhaps using the formula that relates the velocity, period, and mass.

We can express the velocity as:

V = (2π a_i) / P,

so a_i = V * P/(2π).

But a1 + a2 = a.

But M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2,

a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

So a1 + a2 = (M2/M1 + 1) a2 = a.

Hmm, but perhaps substituting a1 and a2 in terms of V.

Because a1 = V1 * P/(2π),

a2 = V2 * P/(2π).

So a1 + a2 = (V1 + V2) * P/(2π) = a.

But also, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a,

a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So,

V1 = (2π a1) / P = (2π (M2/(M1 + M2)) a ) / P.

Similarly,

V2 = (2π a2) / P = (2π (M1/(M1 + M2)) a ) / P.

So, V1 / V2 = M2 / M1.

Which brings us back to the earlier mass ratio.

But how to tie this into the period.

Wait, I think we can use the fact that a³ / (M1 + M2) = G P² / (4 π² )

But a is the separation, which is a1 + a2.

But from the velocities,

a1 = (V1 P)/(2 π),

a2 = (V2 P)/(2 π).

So a = a1 + a2 = (V1 + V2) P/(2 π).

Substituting into the Kepler equation:

[ (V1 + V2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3 / (M1 + M2) = G P²/(4 π² )

Multiplying both sides by (M1 + M2):

[ (V1 + V2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3 = (G P²/(4 π² )) (M1 + M2)

Take cube of (V1 + V2) P/(2 π):

(V1 + V2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) ) = (G P² (M1 + M2) )/(4 π² )

Multiply both sides by 8 π^3:

(V1 + V2)^3 P^3 = 2 G π (M1 + M2) P^2

Divide both sides by P^2:

(V1 + V2)^3 P = 2 G π (M1 + M2)

So,

M1 + M2 = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P ) / (2 G π )

So now, the total mass can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

But wait, the velocities are given in km/s, the period in years. I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Let me compute M for each system using this formula.

First, let's convert the period from years to seconds.

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years.

1 year ≈ 3.154e7 seconds.

So P1 = 2 * 3.154e7 = 6.308e7 s.

V1a = 10 km/s = 10e3 m/s.

V2a = 5 km/s =5e3 m/s.

So V1a + V2a =15e3 m/s.

Compute (V1 + V2)^3 * P1:

(15e3)^3 = (3375e9) m^3/s^3.

Multiply by P1: 3375e9 * 6.308e7 = approx 2.124e17.

Now, denominator: 2 * G * π.

G is 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

So 2 * G * π ≈ 2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.198e-10.

So M1a + M2a = (2.124e17) / (4.198e-10 ) = approx 5.078e26 kg.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, (15e3)^3 = 3375e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1=6.308e7 s:

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 2.124e20 (m^3/s^2).

Wait, wait, no, (V^3) is (m/s)^3, multiplied by P in seconds: so units are (m^3/s^3) * s = m^3/s².

But denominator is 2 G π, which is in m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So the M will be in kg.

So:

(3.375e12 m³/s³) * (6.308e7 s) = 3.375e12 *6.308e7 = 2.124e20 m³/s².

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²) * π ≈ 4.195e-10 m³/(kg s²).

So M = (2.124e20) / (4.195e-10 ) kg.

Which is approximately 5.075e30 kg.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So a binary system with a total mass of 5e30 kg would be about twice the mass of the Sun. But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, (15e3)^3 = (15)^3 * (1e3)^3 = 3375 * 1e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1 (6.308e7 s):

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 3.375 *6.308e19 = approx 21.24e19 = 2.124e20 m³/s².

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 * π ≈ 4.195e-10.

So 2.124e20 / 4.195e-10 = approximately 5.075e29 kg.

Wait, 5e29 kg is about 25 solar masses, since the Sun is ~2e30 kg. So 5e29 is 0.25 solar masses. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 5e29 kg is 5e29 / 2e30 = 0.25 solar masses. That seems more reasonable for a binary system.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 * π.

= 2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416.

= 6.674e-11 * 6.2832 ≈ 4.191e-10.

So denominator is 4.191e-10.

So 2.124e20 / 4.191e-10 = approximately 5.075e29 kg.

Yes, that's about 0.25 solar masses.

Now, system_1's total mass is 0.25 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1b =15, K2b=10. So V1 + V2 =25e3 m/s.

P2=1 year = 3.154e7 s.

Compute (25e3)^3 =15625e9=1.5625e13 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P2=3.154e7 s:

1.5625e13 * 3.154e7 = approx 4.9206e20 m³/s².

Denominator same as before: 4.191e-10.

So M = 4.9206e20 /4.191e-10 = approx 1.174e30 kg.

Which is about 1.174e30 / 2e30 ≈ 0.587 solar masses.

So system_1 has a total mass of ~0.25 solar masses, system_2 ~0.587.

So system_1's mass is 0.25 / 0.587 ≈ 0.425 times system_2's mass.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Wait, the question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is 0.25 and system_2 is 0.587, then 0.25 /0.587 ≈0.425. So system_1 is approximately 0.425 times the mass of system_2. So it's about 0.4 times.

But the options have A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for system_1: M = (15e3)^3 * 6.308e7 / (2 * G * pi )

Wait, no, G is 6.674e-11.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute M1a + M2a:

(V1a + V2a)^3 * P1 / (2 * G * pi )

V1a + V2a =15e3 m/s.

Cube: (15e3)^3 = 3375e9 = 3.375e12 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P1=6.308e7 s:

3.375e12 * 6.308e7 = 3.375 *6.308e(12+7) = 3.375 *6.308e19.

3.375 *6.308 ≈ 21.24.

So 21.24e19 = 2.124e20.

Divide by (2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 )

2 *6.674e-11 =1.3348e-10.

1.3348e-10 *3.1416≈4.193e-10.

So 2.124e20 /4.193e-10 = approx 5.075e29 kg.

Which is 5.075e29 / 1.988e30 kg (solar mass) ≈ 0.255 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2:

V1b + V2b=25e3 m/s.

Cube is (25e3)^3=1.5625e13 (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P2=3.154e7 s:

1.5625e13 *3.154e7 =4.920625e20.

Divide by denominator 4.193e-10:

4.920625e20 /4.193e-10 ≈ 1.173e30 kg.

1.173e30 /1.988e30 ≈ 0.59 solar masses.

So system_1's mass is 0.255, system_2's is 0.59.

So system_1 is 0.255/0.59 ≈0.432 times as massive as system_2. So approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.4, option D is 0.7. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I calculated system_1's mass, I think I should have used the same formula but different velocities.

Wait, let me recheck the formula.

The formula I used was:

M = ( (V1 + V2)^3 * P ) / (2 * G * pi )

Yes, because I derived that M = (V1 + V2)^3 * P / (2 G pi )

So for system_1:

V1 + V2 = 15e3 m/s.

P=2 years = 6.308e7 s.

So M1 = (15e3)^3 * 6.308e7 / (2 * G * pi )

= (3375e9) * 6.308e7 / (4.193e-10 )

Wait, let me compute that:

3375e9 *6.308e7 =3375 *6.308e16 = 21.24e19 = 2.124e20.

Divided by 4.193e-10: 2.124e20 /4.193e-10 =5.075e29 kg.

Which is 0.255 solar masses.

For system_2:

V1 + V2 =25e3 m/s.

P=1 year =3.154e7 s.

So (25e3)^3 =1.5625e13.

Multiply by 3.154e7: 4.9206e20.

Divide by 4.193e-10: 4.9206e20 /4.193e-10 =1.173e30 kg =0.59 solar masses.

So system_1 is smaller in mass than system_2.

So the factor is 0.255/0.59 ≈ 0.432. So about 0.43. So the closest option is A) ~0.4.

But wait, the problem asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. But if system_1's mass is about 0.43 times system_2's, then it's less massive. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1. So the answer should be 0.4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and masses in binary systems. The radial velocity semi-amplitudes, \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \), are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars: 

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{K_2}{K_1}.
\]

### Step 1: Mass Ratios for Each System
#### System_1:
- \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
- The mass ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{M_{1a}}{M_{2a}} = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5.
  \]
- Total mass of system_1:
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{2a} = 0.5 M_{2a} + M_{2a} = 1.5 M_{2a}.
  \]

#### System_2:
- \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
- The mass ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{M_{1b}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}.
  \]
- Total mass of system_2:
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1b} + M_{2b} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2b} + M_{2b} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2b}.
  \]

### Step 2: Relating Total Masses
To compare the total masses of the two systems, we use the derived expressions:
\[
M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_{2a}, \quad M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2b}.
\]
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 M_{2a}}{\frac{5}{3} M_{2b}} = \frac{1.5 \cdot 3}{5} \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{4.5}{5} \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = 0.9 \cdot \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}}.
\]

### Step 3: Using Orbital Periods
The orbital periods are \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \) for system_1 and \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \) for system_2. Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between velocities and periods, the masses can be expressed in terms of the observed velocities and periods. After detailed calculations, the total mass of system_1 is found to be approximately \( 0.255 \, M_\odot \), and the total mass of system_2 is approximately \( 0.59 \, M_\odot \).

### Step 4: Final Mass Ratio
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{0.255}{0.59} \approx 0.432.
\]
This value is closest to \( 0.4 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2.
