Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about isomers and specifically about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Alright, let's break it down.

The question says that among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, I need to find which one doesn't show tautomerism. That's part A. Then, for part B, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, I have to determine which shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a covalent bond between adjacent atoms, usually in a way that changes the position of double bonds. For example, like in keto-enol tautomerism. This requires the presence of adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems, I think. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism would be the one without such a possibility.

Benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, I think. It has two ketone groups in the para positions. Wait, no, actually, quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. For benzoquinone, it's a benzene ring with two ketones opposite each other. So structure-wise, it's O=C6H4=O, but with a ring. So each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. Now, can this undergo tautomerism? Hmm, tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen between two double bonds or conjugated carbonyl groups. Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in conjugation. So maybe it can tautomerize? Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the compound has the right structure for keto-enol or similar tautomerism.

Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. So it's (O=C)3 connected in a ring. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Each ketone is separated by a single carbon. So each carbonyl is adjacent to other carbonyls.

Wait, if a compound has two adjacent carbonyl groups, can that lead to tautomerism? Because tautomerism often requires a hydrogen that can shift between two carbonyls. For example, in diketones like 1,2-diketones, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyls separated by a benzene ring. Are they conjugated? Yes, the ring allows conjugation between the two carbonyl groups. So does that allow for tautomerism? Alternatively, I think benzoquinone can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because the structure allows for the movement of a hydrogen from one oxygen to another through the ring.

Wait, but wait, benzoquinone has two ketones on adjacent positions in a ring. So if I have O=C6H2(O)=O, that's para-benzoquinone. So two ketones across from each other. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, but the ring is conjugated, so the carbonyl groups are conjugated. So maybe tautomerism is possible.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each is separated by one carbon. So positions 1,3,5. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. Wait, no, that's cyclohexane with three ketone groups, each on alternate positions. So maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but in a ring. Hmm, wait, but in a six-membered ring, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each ketone is opposite another, perhaps.

Wait, now, whether tautomerism occurs in such a structure. Tautomerism typically requires a hydrogen adjacent to two carbonyl groups. For example, in a 1,2-diketone, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyls) have H's that can shift, leading to enol formation. But in a 1,3-diketone, the two carbonyls are separated by another carbon. So maybe tautomerism isn't possible because the H isn't in the right position.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is at 1,3,5. So each is two carbons apart. So in that case, maybe each ketone is not adjacent to another, so the structure doesn't have the necessary conjugated system for tautomerism. So maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone can.

Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyls across the ring. So maybe in the case of benzoquinone, the molecule can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are not adjacent. So perhaps it can't shift a hydrogen because the necessary conjugation isn't present for that movement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which of the two can't tautomerize. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Tautomerism usually involves a hydrogen moving from an sp3 to an sp2 hybridized carbon. So, for that, the molecule needs to have a structure where a hydrogen is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. If each ketone is at 1,3,5 positions, then each ketone has a CH2 group between them. So the carbons adjacent to each ketone are CH2 groups. So for each CH2, are the H's on adjacent carbons to two ketones?

Wait, no. Each CH2 is between two ketones. For example, in the trione, each CH2 is between two ketones (like O=C-CH2-CO- etc.). Wait, no, because 1,3,5 are every other position. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each CH2 is adjacent to two ketone groups on either side. So that would mean that each CH2 has H's that are between two carbonyl groups, separated by a single CH2. So maybe tautomerism is possible here.

Wait, but for a 1,3-diketone, the structure is O=C-R-CO-R'. So the two carbonyls are separated by a single carbon. I remember that 1,3-diketones can undergo tautomerism. Because the central carbon (between the two ketones) has two H's, and these can shift. So for example, in 1,3-diketones, the central CH2 can lose a hydrogen, and form an enol, leading to a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by one CH2. So each of those CH2's is between two carbonyl groups. So the structure would have O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in the ring. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each of these CH2 groups has the possibility of tautomerism because each has H's adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So this compound would exhibit tautomerism.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. They are across from each other, so para positions. So each is connected by a conjugated system. Now, in this structure, are there any H's adjacent to two carbonyl groups? Let me imagine the structure: the benzene ring with two ketone groups, each at opposite ends. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, but in a ring. So each ketone is attached to the benzene. The carbons adjacent to each ketone would be the ring carbons, which are double-bonded to the oxygen. Wait, no, the rings are aromatic. So the carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized. So the carbonyl groups are attached to the ring, but the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are already double-bonded. So in that case, the adjacent carbons (the ring carbons) are already in a conjugated system. So perhaps there's no H's attached to positions that can shift, so tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, but wait. In the case of para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each ketone is attached to a benzene ring. The positions adjacent to the ketone are ring carbons, which are part of the aromatic system. So for a tautomer to form, a hydrogen would need to shift between two carbonyl groups. But in this case, the adjacent carbons are already double-bonded as part of the ring, so there are no H's on those carbons. Because in the ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one ketone, and a hydrogen (but wait, benzene rings have each carbon with a hydrogen unless substituted). Wait, wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring, so the ring becomes a quinone structure. So the structure is:

O
||
C6H4
    ||
    O

But more accurately, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. So each ketone is attached to the ring, but the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and have no H's attached (since the ring is conjugated and each carbon is bonded to two others and one O). Wait, no, wait. The ring in benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with four double bonds? Wait, no. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents, but the ring itself is a conjugated dienone. So the structure is a 1,4-diketone in a benzene ring, making it a quinone.

In any case, the adjacent carbons to the ketone groups in benzoquinone are part of the ring, which are sp2 hybridized. So those carbons don't have H's that can shift, because they're already in a double bond. So in benzoquinone, there are no H's on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons that can shift positions. Therefore, tautomerism isn't possible. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

But wait, earlier I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism because each CH2 is between two ketones. So if part A is to find which doesn't show tautomerism, then the correct choice would be benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, no, the question says part A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So which one doesn't? If benzoquinone can't tautomerize, then A is benzoquinone. Alternatively, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't, but I thought it can.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. For tautomerism to occur, the molecule must have a hydrogen atom that can be shifted between two carbonyl groups. So in 1,2-diketones, the central carbon (between the two ketones) has two H's. If one of them shifts, it can form an enol, which is the tautomer.

In 1,3-diketones, the central carbon is between two ketones but with one CH2 between them. Wait, no, 1,3-diketone would be O=C-R-CO-R'. So the CH2 is between the two ketones. So the central CH2 has two H's, and can lose a proton to form an enol. So 1,3-diketones can tautomerize.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three ketones is separated by one CH2. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in a ring. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each CH2 can lose a proton and form an enol, allowing tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, which means it does show tautomerism.

So benzoquinone can't, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons don't have H's, so no tautomerism. So if the question is asking for which doesn't show tautomerism, the answer is benzoquinone.

So A is benzoquinone.

Now moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds with geometric isomerism (like cis-trans) can't have optical isomers unless they also have a chiral center. Wait, no, wait, optical isomerism is about whether the compound has non-superimposable mirror images, meaning the presence of a chiral center. So, a compound that is chiral will have optical isomers.

Alternatively, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center.

Looking at the two compounds:

1. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is: O

       ||

CH3-C-O-CH2-OH

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So the ester group is on the third carbon, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So the molecule is: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 group
- And the other adjacent carbon, which is the first carbon (CH3).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH) connected to carbons 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3, which is connected to carbon 2 and the ester oxygen.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- And what else? Let's see, each carbon has four bonds. So carbon 2 has:

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- And maybe another H?

Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- C1 (CH3)
- OH
- C3 (COOCH3)
- And another H. So the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is:

propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Let me correct. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's confusing. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, right? So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have an -OH on the second carbon, which is the same as the central carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Esterification would replace the -OH of the acid with an OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the structure is:

The acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH, that's correct. Because propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, the ester would be CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, let me draw it properly.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And another CH3? No, wait. Wait, the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C3)
- And another H?

Wait, no, because CH(OH) implies that the carbon has four bonds: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another H. So the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, are all four groups different? Let's see:

CH3 (from C1): a methyl group.

OH: a hydroxyl group.

COOCH3: an ester group.

H: a hydrogen.

So all four substituents are different. So the central carbon (C2) is a chiral center, meaning the molecule has a chiral center. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the second compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It's a cis-diepoxy structure? No, wait, actually, maleic acid is the trans diastereomer, and fumaric is the cis.

Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric is the trans? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans.

Wait, no, I think fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Let me think: maleic acid is the cis dihydroxy form, and fumaric is the trans.

Wait, alternatively, maleic acid has the two carboxylic acid groups on the same side, and fumaric acid has them on opposite sides.

Wait, regardless, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, meaning it's a vicinal diester with the two ester groups on adjacent carbons and on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but in a trans configuration.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration, meaning that the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the two COOH are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where each COOH is replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, so the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
    |
    O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, perhaps better to think of it as (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Since fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration. So each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this structure have a chiral center? Let's see. Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to two ester groups and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3) on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is actually CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's for a saturated compound. Wait, no, for fumaric acid, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So for dimethyl fumarate, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, no, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. So it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a diester with the double bond between the two carbons that have the ester groups.

So, the dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, but each of the two central carbons in the double bond would be connected to two methyl ester groups and the other two bonds are part of the double bond. So each of these carbons is double-bonded to each other, and each has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each of these carbons is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and two more identical CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. So the correct structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because that would be a double bond in the middle. So, correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's?

Wait, no. For fumaric acid, it's HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the structure is a trans-diepoxy, but as an acid. So the diester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, regardless, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, because the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's a saturated compound. But fumaric acid has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in a trans configuration. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each carbon has two COOCH3, a double bond, and two H's. So each of these carbons would have the same substituents: two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond is CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, but if each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups, two H's, and a double bond, then they each have the same substituents. So each carbon would have two identical groups (COOCH3), and two identical H's. So each carbon doesn't have four different substituents, which is necessary for a chiral center. Thus, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

Alternatively, wait, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond, then the two central CH2 groups are connected by a double bond. So each CH2 group is connected to two COOCH3 groups on either end. So each CH2 is attached to two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. Therefore, each has two identical substituents and two identical H's, so they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, but in the trans configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and is achiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that sometimes, even if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, if the substituents are arranged in a certain way, it can be chiral. Wait, no, a plane of symmetry negates chirality. So if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another point: can a molecule with a double bond have geometric isomerism, which is different from optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate, being a trans diester, has geometric isomerism (cis vs trans), but that doesn't directly relate to optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about having non-superimposable mirror images, which requires a chiral center.

So, going back:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center; it's symmetric. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no, wait. No, the question is which one shows optical isomerism. So if the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the second part B would be methyl..., because it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but in the options, part B is the second compound. So the options are:

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, so according to my analysis, A is benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In part B, the two options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Which shows optical isomerism? We determined methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct option is B, where A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen atom to shift between two carbonyl groups, typically involving adjacent carbons. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are separated by the aromatic ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the conjugated system. These carbons are already sp² hybridized and lack hydrogens available for tautomerism. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone is separated by one carbon, and these carbons are adjacent to two ketones. This arrangement allows for tautomerism, as hydrogens on these carbons can shift between the carbonyl groups. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes C2 a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)=CH₂(COOCH₃) in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry prevents the formation of non-superimposable mirror images, so **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism)
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism)

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about isomers and specifically about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Alright, let's break it down.

The question says that among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, I need to find which one doesn't show tautomerism. That's part A. Then, for part B, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, I have to determine which shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a covalent bond between adjacent atoms, usually in a way that changes the position of double bonds. For example, like in keto-enol tautomerism. This requires the presence of adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems, I think. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism would be the one without such a possibility.

Benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, I think. It has two ketone groups in the para positions. Wait, no, actually, quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. For benzoquinone, it's a benzene ring with two ketones opposite each other. So structure-wise, it's O=C6H4=O, but with a ring. So each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. Now, can this undergo tautomerism? Hmm, tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen between two double bonds or conjugated carbonyl groups. Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in conjugation. So maybe it can tautomerize? Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the compound has the right structure for keto-enol or similar tautomerism.

Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. So it's (O=C)3 connected in a ring. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Each ketone is separated by a single carbon. So each carbonyl is adjacent to other carbonyls.

Wait, if a compound has two adjacent carbonyl groups, can that lead to tautomerism? Because tautomerism often requires a hydrogen that can shift between two carbonyls. For example, in diketones like 1,2-diketones, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyls separated by a benzene ring. Are they conjugated? Yes, the ring allows conjugation between the two carbonyl groups. So does that allow for tautomerism? Alternatively, I think benzoquinone can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because the structure allows for the movement of a hydrogen from one oxygen to another through the ring.

Wait, but wait, benzoquinone has two ketones on adjacent positions in a ring. So if I have O=C6H2(O)=O, that's para-benzoquinone. So two ketones across from each other. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, but the ring is conjugated, so the carbonyl groups are conjugated. So maybe tautomerism is possible.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each is separated by one carbon. So positions 1,3,5. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. Wait, no, that's cyclohexane with three ketone groups, each on alternate positions. So maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but in a ring. Hmm, wait, but in a six-membered ring, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each ketone is opposite another, perhaps.

Wait, now, whether tautomerism occurs in such a structure. Tautomerism typically requires a hydrogen adjacent to two carbonyl groups. For example, in a 1,2-diketone, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyls) have H's that can shift, leading to enol formation. But in a 1,3-diketone, the two carbonyls are separated by another carbon. So maybe tautomerism isn't possible because the H isn't in the right position.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is at 1,3,5. So each is two carbons apart. So in that case, maybe each ketone is not adjacent to another, so the structure doesn't have the necessary conjugated system for tautomerism. So maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone can.

Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyls across the ring. So maybe in the case of benzoquinone, the molecule can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are not adjacent. So perhaps it can't shift a hydrogen because the necessary conjugation isn't present for that movement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which of the two can't tautomerize. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Tautomerism usually involves a hydrogen moving from an sp3 to an sp2 hybridized carbon. So, for that, the molecule needs to have a structure where a hydrogen is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. If each ketone is at 1,3,5 positions, then each ketone has a CH2 group between them. So the carbons adjacent to each ketone are CH2 groups. So for each CH2, are the H's on adjacent carbons to two ketones?

Wait, no. Each CH2 is between two ketones. For example, in the trione, each CH2 is between two ketones (like O=C-CH2-CO- etc.). Wait, no, because 1,3,5 are every other position. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each CH2 is adjacent to two ketone groups on either side. So that would mean that each CH2 has H's that are between two carbonyl groups, separated by a single CH2. So maybe tautomerism is possible here.

Wait, but for a 1,3-diketone, the structure is O=C-R-CO-R'. So the two carbonyls are separated by a single carbon. I remember that 1,3-diketones can undergo tautomerism. Because the central carbon (between the two ketones) has two H's, and these can shift. So for example, in 1,3-diketones, the central CH2 can lose a hydrogen, and form an enol, leading to a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by one CH2. So each of those CH2's is between two carbonyl groups. So the structure would have O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in the ring. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each of these CH2 groups has the possibility of tautomerism because each has H's adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So this compound would exhibit tautomerism.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. They are across from each other, so para positions. So each is connected by a conjugated system. Now, in this structure, are there any H's adjacent to two carbonyl groups? Let me imagine the structure: the benzene ring with two ketone groups, each at opposite ends. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, but in a ring. So each ketone is attached to the benzene. The carbons adjacent to each ketone would be the ring carbons, which are double-bonded to the oxygen. Wait, no, the rings are aromatic. So the carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized. So the carbonyl groups are attached to the ring, but the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are already double-bonded. So in that case, the adjacent carbons (the ring carbons) are already in a conjugated system. So perhaps there's no H's attached to positions that can shift, so tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, but wait. In the case of para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each ketone is attached to a benzene ring. The positions adjacent to the ketone are ring carbons, which are part of the aromatic system. So for a tautomer to form, a hydrogen would need to shift between two carbonyl groups. But in this case, the adjacent carbons are already double-bonded as part of the ring, so there are no H's on those carbons. Because in the ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one ketone, and a hydrogen (but wait, benzene rings have each carbon with a hydrogen unless substituted). Wait, wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring, so the ring becomes a quinone structure. So the structure is:

O
||
C6H4
    ||
    O

But more accurately, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. So each ketone is attached to the ring, but the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and have no H's attached (since the ring is conjugated and each carbon is bonded to two others and one O). Wait, no, wait. The ring in benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with four double bonds? Wait, no. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents, but the ring itself is a conjugated dienone. So the structure is a 1,4-diketone in a benzene ring, making it a quinone.

In any case, the adjacent carbons to the ketone groups in benzoquinone are part of the ring, which are sp2 hybridized. So those carbons don't have H's that can shift, because they're already in a double bond. So in benzoquinone, there are no H's on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons that can shift positions. Therefore, tautomerism isn't possible. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

But wait, earlier I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism because each CH2 is between two ketones. So if part A is to find which doesn't show tautomerism, then the correct choice would be benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, no, the question says part A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So which one doesn't? If benzoquinone can't tautomerize, then A is benzoquinone. Alternatively, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't, but I thought it can.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. For tautomerism to occur, the molecule must have a hydrogen atom that can be shifted between two carbonyl groups. So in 1,2-diketones, the central carbon (between the two ketones) has two H's. If one of them shifts, it can form an enol, which is the tautomer.

In 1,3-diketones, the central carbon is between two ketones but with one CH2 between them. Wait, no, 1,3-diketone would be O=C-R-CO-R'. So the CH2 is between the two ketones. So the central CH2 has two H's, and can lose a proton to form an enol. So 1,3-diketones can tautomerize.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three ketones is separated by one CH2. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in a ring. So each CH2 is between two ketones. So each CH2 can lose a proton and form an enol, allowing tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, which means it does show tautomerism.

So benzoquinone can't, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons don't have H's, so no tautomerism. So if the question is asking for which doesn't show tautomerism, the answer is benzoquinone.

So A is benzoquinone.

Now moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds with geometric isomerism (like cis-trans) can't have optical isomers unless they also have a chiral center. Wait, no, wait, optical isomerism is about whether the compound has non-superimposable mirror images, meaning the presence of a chiral center. So, a compound that is chiral will have optical isomers.

Alternatively, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center.

Looking at the two compounds:

1. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is: O

       ||

CH3-C-O-CH2-OH

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So the ester group is on the third carbon, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So the molecule is: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 group
- And the other adjacent carbon, which is the first carbon (CH3).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH) connected to carbons 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3, which is connected to carbon 2 and the ester oxygen.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- And what else? Let's see, each carbon has four bonds. So carbon 2 has:

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- And maybe another H?

Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- C1 (CH3)
- OH
- C3 (COOCH3)
- And another H. So the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is:

propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Let me correct. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's confusing. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, right? So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have an -OH on the second carbon, which is the same as the central carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Esterification would replace the -OH of the acid with an OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the structure is:

The acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH, that's correct. Because propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, the ester would be CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, let me draw it properly.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And another CH3? No, wait. Wait, the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C3)
- And another H?

Wait, no, because CH(OH) implies that the carbon has four bonds: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another H. So the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, are all four groups different? Let's see:

CH3 (from C1): a methyl group.

OH: a hydroxyl group.

COOCH3: an ester group.

H: a hydrogen.

So all four substituents are different. So the central carbon (C2) is a chiral center, meaning the molecule has a chiral center. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the second compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It's a cis-diepoxy structure? No, wait, actually, maleic acid is the trans diastereomer, and fumaric is the cis.

Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric is the trans? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans.

Wait, no, I think fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Let me think: maleic acid is the cis dihydroxy form, and fumaric is the trans.

Wait, alternatively, maleic acid has the two carboxylic acid groups on the same side, and fumaric acid has them on opposite sides.

Wait, regardless, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, meaning it's a vicinal diester with the two ester groups on adjacent carbons and on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but in a trans configuration.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration, meaning that the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the two COOH are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where each COOH is replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, so the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
    |
    O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, perhaps better to think of it as (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Since fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration. So each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this structure have a chiral center? Let's see. Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to two ester groups and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3) on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is actually CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's for a saturated compound. Wait, no, for fumaric acid, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So for dimethyl fumarate, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, no, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. So it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a diester with the double bond between the two carbons that have the ester groups.

So, the dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, but each of the two central carbons in the double bond would be connected to two methyl ester groups and the other two bonds are part of the double bond. So each of these carbons is double-bonded to each other, and each has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each of these carbons is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and two more identical CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. So the correct structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because that would be a double bond in the middle. So, correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's?

Wait, no. For fumaric acid, it's HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the structure is a trans-diepoxy, but as an acid. So the diester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, regardless, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, because the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's a saturated compound. But fumaric acid has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but in a trans configuration. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each carbon has two COOCH3, a double bond, and two H's. So each of these carbons would have the same substituents: two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond is CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, but if each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups, two H's, and a double bond, then they each have the same substituents. So each carbon would have two identical groups (COOCH3), and two identical H's. So each carbon doesn't have four different substituents, which is necessary for a chiral center. Thus, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

Alternatively, wait, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond, then the two central CH2 groups are connected by a double bond. So each CH2 group is connected to two COOCH3 groups on either end. So each CH2 is attached to two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. Therefore, each has two identical substituents and two identical H's, so they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, but in the trans configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and is achiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that sometimes, even if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, if the substituents are arranged in a certain way, it can be chiral. Wait, no, a plane of symmetry negates chirality. So if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another point: can a molecule with a double bond have geometric isomerism, which is different from optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate, being a trans diester, has geometric isomerism (cis vs trans), but that doesn't directly relate to optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about having non-superimposable mirror images, which requires a chiral center.

So, going back:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center; it's symmetric. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no, wait. No, the question is which one shows optical isomerism. So if the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the second part B would be methyl..., because it shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but in the options, part B is the second compound. So the options are:

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, so according to my analysis, A is benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In part B, the two options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Which shows optical isomerism? We determined methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct option is B, where A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So option B is the correct answer.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen atom to shift between two carbonyl groups, typically involving adjacent carbons. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are separated by the aromatic ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the conjugated system. These carbons are already sp² hybridized and lack hydrogens available for tautomerism. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone is separated by one carbon, and these carbons are adjacent to two ketones. This arrangement allows for tautomerism, as hydrogens on these carbons can shift between the carbonyl groups. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes C2 a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)=CH₂(COOCH₃) in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry prevents the formation of non-superimposable mirror images, so **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism)
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism)

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
