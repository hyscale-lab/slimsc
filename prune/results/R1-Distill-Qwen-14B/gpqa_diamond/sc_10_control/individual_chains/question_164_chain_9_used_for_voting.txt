Okay, I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods—2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. 

Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of both stars in each system.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is based on Kepler's laws. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity amplitude will be smaller because velocity is inversely proportional to mass. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars to their masses and the orbital period. The formula is something like:

(M1 sin^3 i) / ( (M_total)^2 ) ) = ( (K1)^3 P ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

Where q is M2/M1, and K1 is the semi-amplitude of the velocity for star 1. But i is the inclination angle. Since the systems are eclipsing, i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can ignore that for a simplified calculation.

Alternatively, I remember that in a spectroscopic binary, the masses are determined using the ratio of the velocity amplitudes. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving more slowly due to the gravitational pull. So if star A has velocity K1 and star B has K2, then their mass ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The mass is inversely proportional to the velocity. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let's see. The center of mass is where M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. And the velocity is proportional to a / P, where P is the period. So K1 = 2π a1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)), but assuming circular orbits, e is zero, so K1 = (2π a1)/P.

Similarly, K2 = (2π a2)/P.

Since M1 a1 = M2 a2, then a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

So K1 = (2π/(P)) * a1 = (2π/(P)) * (M2/M1) a2.

But K2 = (2π a2)/P.

So K1/K2 = (M2/M1).

So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Yes, that makes sense. So mass ratio is inverse of velocity ratio.

So in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5 km/s. Let me call them K1a=10 and K2a=5 (for system_1). So M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5.

Wait, but we need the total mass for each system. So for system_1, M1a + M2a = M_total1.

But wait, if the mass ratio is M1a/M2a = 0.5, then M1a = 0.5 M2a. So M_total1 = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a. So M2a = (2/3) M_total1. Hmm, not sure if this is necessary yet.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the mass function for each system.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But to find the actual masses, we need q, the mass ratio. Since we can't directly observe the masses, but we can relate the velocities.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitudes and the period. Let's recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion.

In the case of a binary system, the mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But without knowing q, it's tricky. However, in an eclipsing binary, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1, and sometimes we can take that as given. So in that case, the mass function f(M) is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But if i is 90 degrees, then sin i is 1, so f(M) = M2^3 / (M_total)^2.

But wait, the mass function is for each star. Alternatively, perhaps each star's mass is determined using the mass function, but since we can't observe both, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, I remember that the product of the mass and the velocity is the same for both stars in a binary system because M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a is proportional to velocity times period (since velocity is distance over time). So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2.

Wait, that's it. Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and a1 = K1 * P/(2π) (since a1 is the semi-major axis, which is distance, and K1 is velocity, so a1 = K1 * period / (2π) because velocity is distance over time).

Wait, let's be precise. The semi-major axis a = (K * P * sin i) / (2π). Because velocity is K = 2π a / (P sin i), since the actual orbital speed is (2π a)/P, but if the inclination is i, then the observed Doppler shift is (K) = (2π a sin i)/P. So a = (K P)/(2π sin i). Since in eclipsing binaries, sin i is 1, so a = K P/(2π).

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2.

But a1 = (K1 P)/(2π), a2 = (K2 P)/(2π).

So:

M1 * (K1 P/(2π)) = M2 * (K2 P/(2π)).

The P and 2π terms cancel out.

So, M1 K1 = M2 K2.

Thus, M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1).

So the mass ratio is K2 / K1 for each system.

So for system_1: K1a=10, K2a=5.

So M1a / M2a = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 * M2a.

Total mass for system_1: M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a =1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2: K1b=15, K2b=10.

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b =10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass for system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Wait, but how do I relate this to the total mass of each system?

Wait, perhaps I should find M_total1 and M_total2, then take their ratio.

So, for system_1:

M1a = 0.5 M2a.

Total M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

So M2a = (2/3) M_total1.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (2/3) M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So M2b = (3/5) M_total2.

But how do these relate to each other?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the period affects the mass function, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the other thing I remember is that for binary systems, the mass function is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i is 1 for eclipsing binaries, it's f(M) = M2^3 / (M_total)^2.

But without knowing which star is more massive, perhaps this approach is not directly helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the masses using the velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, the formula I have is M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So for system_1:

M1a K1a = M2a K2a.

10 M1a =5 M2a → M1a = (5/10) M2a = 0.5 M2a.

Thus, M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, system_2:

M1b K1b = M2b K2b.

15 M1b =10 M2b → M1b = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So, now, I have expressions for M_total1 and M_total2 in terms of M2a and M2b, respectively.

But how do I find the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2?

Wait, maybe I can find M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2a) / ( (5/3) M2b ) ) = (1.5 * 3 /5 ) ( M2a / M2b )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio M2a / M2b.

Wait, perhaps I need another relation. Maybe the orbital period is connected to the masses. The period is given, 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Wait, Kepler's third law in binary systems says that the sum of the masses is related to the cube of the semi-major axis and the square of the period. But the semi-major axis isn't directly given.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) (M2 sin i )/( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + q) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complex. Alternatively, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) * sin i ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + q) )^(2/3) )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * M2 sin i / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the formula for the orbital velocity. The orbital velocity v is given by v = (2π a )/(P), where a is the semi-major axis. For a binary system, each star orbits the center of mass. So, the separation between the two stars is a_total = a1 + a2.

The total mass is M = M1 + M2.

The center of mass condition is M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2 a_total)/(M1 + M2) ) = (M2/(M_total)) a_total.

Similarly, a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a_total.

Each star's velocity is v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So v1 = (2π M2 a_total )/(P M_total )

v2 = (2π M1 a_total )/(P M_total )

But the separation a_total is related to the period and the masses via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

a_total^3 = (G (M1 + M2) P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a_total = [ ( G M_total P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a_total into the expressions for v1 and v2:

v1 = (2 π M2 / (P M_total)) * [ ( G M_total P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute v1:

v1 = (2 π M2 )/(P M_total) * [ (G M_total P^2 )/(4 π^2) ]^(1/3 )

Let me factor out the terms inside the cube root:

[ G M_total P^2 / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (G)^(1/3) (M_total)^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) / (4 π^2)^(1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π M2 )/(P M_total) ) * [ G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Simplify each term:

2 π / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3)) ) = 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) * π^(1/3 )

Because 4=2², so 4^(1/3)=2^(2/3). And 2 / 2^(2/3) )= 2^(1 - 2/3)= 2^(1/3).

So this part becomes 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3 )= (2π)^(1/3 )

So, bringing it all together:

v1 = [ (2 π)^(1/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * ( M2 ) / ( P M_total )

Wait, let's collect the exponents:

M_total terms: (M_total^(1/3 )) / M_total ) = M_total^(-2/3 )

P terms: P^(2/3 ) / P = P^(-1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2 / ( M_total^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Similarly, v2 would be:

v2 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M1 / ( M_total^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in spectroscopic binaries, only one companion's velocity is measured (the one that's easier to detect, usually the less massive star because it has a larger velocity). But in this problem, both RV amplitudes are given for each system.

So, for system_1:

v1a = 10 km/s, v2a=5 km/s.

Similarly, system_2: v1b=15, v2b=10.

So, for system_1:

v1a = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2a / ( M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

v2a = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M1a / ( M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Dividing v1a by v2a:

v1a / v2a = ( M2a ) / ( M1a )

Which gives M1a / M2a = v2a / v1a = 5/10 = 0.5. Which is consistent with what I found earlier.

Similarly, for system_2: v1b / v2b = ( M2b ) / ( M1b ) → M1b / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

But to find the ratio of the total masses, I need to relate M_total1 and M_total2.

Another approach: perhaps express each M_total in terms of their respective K and P.

Wait, from the expressions above, for each system, the velocities are:

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2 / ( (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Similarly for v2.

But since in each system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, as we found earlier.

So, M1 = (M2 K2 ) / K1.

Thus, M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 ( K2 / K1 + 1 )

= M2 ( ( K2 + K1 ) / K1 )

So, M2 = M_total * K1 / ( K1 + K2 )

But perhaps I can find a way to express M_total in terms of K and P.

Wait, let's think about the formula for the velocity amplitude K in terms of the orbital parameters.

K = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( ( M_total )^(2/3) (1 + q )^(1/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )

But since i is 90 degrees, sin i =1.

Alternatively, putting it all together, perhaps the mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = ( K1^3 P ) / (241 )

Assuming i=90 degrees, because the system is eclipsing.

Wait, hold on. The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K1 * 29.78 )^3 * P ) / (241 * (1 + q )^2 )

Wait, I'm a bit confused with the constants. Let me look up the mass function formula.

The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K_1^3 ) * P ) / (241 )

But this is when P is in years, K in km/s, and f(M) is in solar masses.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formula is:

f(M) = ( (K_1^3 ) * P ) / ( (241 ) * (1 + q)^2 )

Where q = M2/M1.

But without knowing q, it's hard to find M1 and M2 individually.

Alternatively, for each system, we can write the mass function for each star.

Wait, perhaps for system_1, we have two stars with K1a=10 km/s and K2a=5 km/s.

So for star 1 in system_1, f(M1) = ( (10)^3 * 2 ) / (241 * (1 + q1)^2 )

But q1 is M2a/M1a. From earlier, we have M1a=0.5 M2a → q1 = (M2a)/(0.5 M2a ) ) = 2.

So q1=2.

So for star 1:

f(M1) = (1000 * 2 ) / (241 * (1+2)^2 ) = 2000 / (241 * 9 ) ≈ 2000 / 2169 ≈ 0.922 solar masses.

Similarly, the mass function f(M1) = (M2a^3 ) / ( (M_total1 )^2 )

So,

0.922 = ( M2a^3 ) / ( (M_total1)^2 )

But M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a → M_total1 = 1.5 M2a.

So,

0.922 = ( M2a^3 ) / ( (1.5 M2a )^2 )

Simplify denominator: (1.5)^2 M2a² = 2.25 M2a².

So,

0.922 = M2a^3 / ( 2.25 M2a² ) = M2a / 2.25.

So,

M2a = 0.922 * 2.25 ≈ 2.0745 solar masses.

So M_total1 = 1.5 * M2a ≈ 1.5 * 2.0745 ≈ 3.1118 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2: K1b=15, K2b=10.

So for star 1 in system_2, K1b=15, and K2b=10.

Then, q2 = M2b/M1b = (M2b)/(M1b) = (M2b)/( (M2b * K2b ) / K1b ) )

Wait, from earlier, M1b = (K2b / K1b ) * M2b.

Since K1b=15, K2b=10 → M1b = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

So q2 = M2b / M1b = M2b/( (2/3) M2b ) ) = 3/2 = 1.5.

So, the mass function f(M2) for system_2 is:

f(M2) = ( K2b^3 * P2 ) / (241 * (1 + q2)^2 )

K2b=10, P2=1 year.

So,

f(M2) = (10^3 * 1 ) / (241 * (1 + 1.5 )^2 ) = 1000 / (241 * (2.5)^2 )

(2.5)^2 =6.25.

So denominator is 241 * 6.25 ≈ 241 *6=1446, 241*0.25=60.25 → total 1506.25.

So,

f(M2) ≈ 1000 / 1506.25 ≈ 0.664 solar masses.

But f(M2) is the mass function for star 2, which is f(M2) = M1b^3 / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

So,

0.664 = ( M1b^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

But M1b = (2/3) M2b, and M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

0.664 = ( ( (2/3) M2b )^3 ) / ( ( (5/3) M2b )^2 )

Simplify numerator: (8/27) M2b^3.

Denominator: (25/9) M2b².

So,

0.664 = [ (8/27) M2b^3 ] / [ (25/9) M2b^2 ) ] = (8/27) * M2b / (25/9 )

= (8/27 ) * (9/25) M2b = (8*9)/(27*25) M2b

Simplify:

8*9 =72, 27*25=675 → 72/675 = 24/225 = 8/75.

So,

0.664 = (8/75) * M2b → M2b = 0.664 * (75/8 )

Calculate 75/8 = 9.375 → 0.664 *9.375 ≈ ?

0.664 *9 =5.976, 0.664 *0.375=0.249 → total ≈6.225.

So M2b≈6.225 solar masses.

Then, M_total2 = (5/3) M2b ≈ (5/3)*6.225 ≈ 10.375 solar masses.

So, M_total1 ≈3.1118, M_total2≈10.375.

So, the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 ≈ 3.1118 / 10.375 ≈0.30.

Wait, that's about 0.3, but looking at the options, the closest is option A ~0.4, or option D ~0.7.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass function for system_2.

Wait, in system_2, for star 2, K2b=10, but the mass function formula is:

f(M) = (K^3 * P ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But which K do I use? For system_2, star 1 has K1b=15, star 2 K2b=10.

Wait, the mass function for each star is different. So for star 1 in system_2, K1=15, and q2= M2b/M1b=1.5.

So f(M1) for star 1 would be:

f(M1) = (15^3 * 1 ) / (241 * (1 + 1.5 )^2 )

15^3=3375.

Denominator:241 *6.25≈1506.25.

So f(M1)=3375/1506.25 ≈ 2.239.

But f(M1) is M2b^3 / (M_total2)^2.

So,

2.239 = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b ) + M2b = (5/3 M2b ).

So,

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

2.239 = M2b^3 / ( (5/3 M2b )^2 )

Simplify denominator: (25/9) M2b².

So,

2.239 = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (25/9) M2b² ) ) = (9 M2b ) /25.

So,

(9 M2b ) /25 =2.239 → M2b = (2.239 *25 ) /9 ≈ 55.975 /9 ≈6.219 solar masses.

M_total2 = (5/3) *6.219 ≈10.365.

So M_total1 is 3.1118, M_total2 is approximately 10.365.

So ratio M_total1 / M_total2 =3.1118 /10.365 ≈ 0.300.

Hmm, that's about 0.3, which is not one of the options. The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the mass function. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have used the mass function but another approach.

Wait, another approach: using the formula M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So, for system_1:

M1a K1a = M2a K2a → M1a *10 = M2a *5 → M1a = 0.5 M2a.

Total mass M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, system_2:

M1b K1b = M2b K2b → M1b *15 = M2b *10 → M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the other thing we know is that the period is related to the masses and the separation. Using Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π²/G(M_total)) * a^3.

But a is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2.

But a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a.

a2 = (M1/(M_total)) * a.

But a = a1 + a2 = a.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of velocities and the period.

The orbital speed v is 2π a / (P sin i ), which for i=90 is 2π a/P.

But since the velocities are K1 and K2, we have:

K1 = (2 π a1 ) / P.

Similarly, K2 = (2 π a2 )/ P.

But a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a, a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a.

So,

K1 = (2 π (M2 a) )/(M_total P )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π (M1 a) )/( M_total P )

Multiply K1 and K2:

K1 K2 = (4 π² (M1 M2 a² ) ) / ( M_total² P² )

But from Kepler's third law,

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_total )

Rearranged,

a³ = ( G M_total P² )/(4 π² )

So,

a² = [ ( G M_total P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(2/3 )

= G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) )

Substituting back into the product K1 K2:

K1 K2 = (4 π² (M1 M2 ) ) / ( M_total² P² ) * [ G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) ) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) ) ) ]

Simplify:

4 π² / (M_total² P² ) * G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) )

= 4/(4^(2/3)) ) * ( π² / π^(4/3) ) * ( G^(2/3) ) * ( M_total^(2/3) / M_total² ) * ( P^(4/3) / P^2 )

Simplify each term:

4 / (4^(2/3)) = 4^(1 - 2/3) )=4^(1/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)=2^(2/3) ≈1.5874.

π² / π^(4/3) = π^(2 -4/3)= π^(2/3) ≈2.145.

G^(2/3) = (6.674×10^-11 )^(2/3), but perhaps we don't need the actual value since we're taking ratios.

M_total^(2/3) / M_total² = M_total^(-4/3 )

P^(4/3)/ P^2 = P^(-2/3 )

So putting it all together:

K1 K2 = 2^(2/3) * π^(2/3) * G^(2/3) * M1 M2 * M_total^(-4/3) * P^(-2/3 ) 

But M1 M2 = M_total^2 - (M1 - M2 )^2 ≈ M_total^2 for M1≈M2, but perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the product K1 K2 is proportional to (M1 M2 )^(1) * ( M_total )^(-4/3 ) * P^(-2/3 )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe it's better to take the ratio of the total masses.

We have M_total1 =1.5 M2a.

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

But we need to find M_total1 / M_total2.

Wait, but without knowing M2a and M2b, how?

Wait, perhaps we can set up a ratio between the two systems using the relations.

From system_1:

M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So M_total1 = 1.5 M2a.

From system_2:

M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2a ) / ( (5/3) M2b ) ) = ( (3/2) M2a ) / (5/3 M2b ) ) = (9 M2a ) / (10 M2b )

So, M_total1 / M_total2 = (9/10 ) ( M2a / M2b )

But we don't know M2a and M2b. So how?

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation between M2a and M2b.

I recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to mass and period.

From the formula: K = [ (G M_total )/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ] * [ (2 π )/( P ) ] * [ M_companion sin i ] / ( M_total )^(2/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * ( M_companion sin i ) / ( ( M_total )^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Again, i=90°, so sin i=1.

So for system_1, star 1 has K1a=10 km/s, and its companion is M2a.

So,

10 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2a / ( ( M_total1 )^(2/3) (2 years )^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2, star 1 has K1b=15, companion M2b, period 1 year.

15 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2b / ( ( M_total2 )^(2/3) (1 year )^(1/3) )

Dividing the two equations:

10 /15 = [ M2a / M_total1^(2/3) (2)^(1/3) ) ] / [ M2b / M_total2^(2/3) (1)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

2/3 = [ (M2a M_total2^(2/3) ) / ( M2b M_total1^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) ) ]

We can rearrange this to:

( M2a / M2b ) = (2/3 ) * ( M_total1^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) / ( M_total2^(2/3) )

But from earlier, M_total1 = 1.5 M2a and M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total1 =1.5 M2a → M_total1^(2/3) = (1.5)^(2/3) * M2a^(2/3 )

Similarly, M_total2 = (5/3) M2b → M_total2^(2/3) = (5/3)^(2/3) * M2b^(2/3 )

Substituting into the equation:

( M2a / M2b ) = (2/3 ) * [ (1.5^(2/3) M2a^(2/3) ) * 2^(1/3) ) ] / [ (5/3)^(2/3) M2b^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify:

Left side: M2a / M2b.

Right side: (2/3) * [ 1.5^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) / (5/3)^(2/3) ) ] * [ (M2a^(2/3)) / (M2b^(2/3) ) ) ]

Which is:

[2/3 ] * [ (1.5^2 * 2 )^(1/3) / ( (5/3)^2 )^(1/3) ) ] * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Wait, let me compute the constants:

Compute 1.5^2 = 2.25. So 2.25 *2 =4.5.

(5/3)^2 =25/9 ≈2.7778.

So,

(4.5 ) / (25/9 ) ) = 4.5 *9 /25 = (40.5)/25 = 1.62.

But each is raised to 1/3 power.

So,

(4.5/ (25/9 ))^(1/3) = (1.62 )^(1/3) ≈1.175.

Wait, 1.62^(1/3) is approximately 1.175 because 1.175^3 ≈1.62.

So,

Right side becomes:

(2/3 ) * 1.175 * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Putting it all together:

M2a / M2b = (2/3) * 1.175 * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Let’s let x = ( M2a / M2b )

So,

x = (2/3) * 1.175 * x^(2/3 )

Divide both sides by x^(2/3 ):

x^(1 - 2/3 ) = (2/3 *1.175 )

x^(1/3 ) = (2 *1.175 )/(3 )

2 *1.175=2.35; 2.35/3≈0.7833.

So,

x^(1/3 ) ≈0.7833 → x ≈ (0.7833 )^3 ≈0.7833 *0.7833 =0.6135, *0.7833≈0.481.

So x≈0.481 → M2a / M2b=0.481.

Now, back to M_total1 / M_total2.

Which is (9/10 ) * ( M2a / M2b ) ≈ (9/10)*0.481 ≈0.4329.

So approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4.

So the factor is system_1 is about 0.4 times more massive than system_2.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

So if system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, then system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is 2.5 times more massive. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the ratio is M_total1 / M_total2 ≈0.43.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

So the factor is ~0.4, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, masses, and orbital periods.

### Key Observations and Relationships:
1. **Mass Ratio and Radial Velocities**:  
   In a binary system, the mass ratio \( q = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \) is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes:  
   \[
   q = \frac{K_2}{K_1}
   \]  
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.

2. **Total Mass**:  
   The total mass of the system is the sum of the individual masses:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2
   \]  
   Using the mass ratio \( q \), the total mass can be expressed as:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q} \right)
   \]

3. **Mass Function**:  
   The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes, orbital period, and total mass:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{241 \, (1 + q)^2}
   \]  
   For eclipsing binaries, the inclination \( i \approx 90^\circ \), so \( \sin i \approx 1 \).

### Analysis of System_1:
- **Velocity Amplitudes**: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- **Mass Ratio**:  
  \[
  q_1 = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
  \]  
- **Total Mass**:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q_1} \right) = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{0.5} \right) = 1.5 M_2
  \]

### Analysis of System_2:
- **Velocity Amplitudes**: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- **Mass Ratio**:  
  \[
  q_2 = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{10}{15} = 0.6667
  \]  
- **Total Mass**:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q_2} \right) = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{0.6667} \right) = 1.5 M_2
  \]

### Ratio of Total Masses:
The ratio of the total masses is given by:  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 M_{2,1}}{1.5 M_{2,2}} = \frac{M_{2,1}}{M_{2,2}}
\]  
To find \( \frac{M_{2,1}}{M_{2,2}} \), we use the mass function and the fact that the periods are \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}, P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \). After detailed calculations, the ratio is found to be approximately:  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} \approx 0.4
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2. This corresponds to **option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods—2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. 

Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of both stars in each system.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is based on Kepler's laws. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity amplitude will be smaller because velocity is inversely proportional to mass. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars to their masses and the orbital period. The formula is something like:

(M1 sin^3 i) / ( (M_total)^2 ) ) = ( (K1)^3 P ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

Where q is M2/M1, and K1 is the semi-amplitude of the velocity for star 1. But i is the inclination angle. Since the systems are eclipsing, i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can ignore that for a simplified calculation.

Alternatively, I remember that in a spectroscopic binary, the masses are determined using the ratio of the velocity amplitudes. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving more slowly due to the gravitational pull. So if star A has velocity K1 and star B has K2, then their mass ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The mass is inversely proportional to the velocity. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let's see. The center of mass is where M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. And the velocity is proportional to a / P, where P is the period. So K1 = 2π a1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)), but assuming circular orbits, e is zero, so K1 = (2π a1)/P.

Similarly, K2 = (2π a2)/P.

Since M1 a1 = M2 a2, then a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

So K1 = (2π/(P)) * a1 = (2π/(P)) * (M2/M1) a2.

But K2 = (2π a2)/P.

So K1/K2 = (M2/M1).

So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Yes, that makes sense. So mass ratio is inverse of velocity ratio.

So in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5 km/s. Let me call them K1a=10 and K2a=5 (for system_1). So M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5.

Wait, but we need the total mass for each system. So for system_1, M1a + M2a = M_total1.

But wait, if the mass ratio is M1a/M2a = 0.5, then M1a = 0.5 M2a. So M_total1 = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a. So M2a = (2/3) M_total1. Hmm, not sure if this is necessary yet.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the mass function for each system.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But to find the actual masses, we need q, the mass ratio. Since we can't directly observe the masses, but we can relate the velocities.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitudes and the period. Let's recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion.

In the case of a binary system, the mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But without knowing q, it's tricky. However, in an eclipsing binary, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1, and sometimes we can take that as given. So in that case, the mass function f(M) is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But if i is 90 degrees, then sin i is 1, so f(M) = M2^3 / (M_total)^2.

But wait, the mass function is for each star. Alternatively, perhaps each star's mass is determined using the mass function, but since we can't observe both, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, I remember that the product of the mass and the velocity is the same for both stars in a binary system because M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a is proportional to velocity times period (since velocity is distance over time). So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2.

Wait, that's it. Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and a1 = K1 * P/(2π) (since a1 is the semi-major axis, which is distance, and K1 is velocity, so a1 = K1 * period / (2π) because velocity is distance over time).

Wait, let's be precise. The semi-major axis a = (K * P * sin i) / (2π). Because velocity is K = 2π a / (P sin i), since the actual orbital speed is (2π a)/P, but if the inclination is i, then the observed Doppler shift is (K) = (2π a sin i)/P. So a = (K P)/(2π sin i). Since in eclipsing binaries, sin i is 1, so a = K P/(2π).

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2.

But a1 = (K1 P)/(2π), a2 = (K2 P)/(2π).

So:

M1 * (K1 P/(2π)) = M2 * (K2 P/(2π)).

The P and 2π terms cancel out.

So, M1 K1 = M2 K2.

Thus, M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1).

So the mass ratio is K2 / K1 for each system.

So for system_1: K1a=10, K2a=5.

So M1a / M2a = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M1a = 0.5 * M2a.

Total mass for system_1: M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a =1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2: K1b=15, K2b=10.

M1b / M2b = K2b / K1b =10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So M1b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass for system_2: M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Wait, but how do I relate this to the total mass of each system?

Wait, perhaps I should find M_total1 and M_total2, then take their ratio.

So, for system_1:

M1a = 0.5 M2a.

Total M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

So M2a = (2/3) M_total1.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (2/3) M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So M2b = (3/5) M_total2.

But how do these relate to each other?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the period affects the mass function, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the other thing I remember is that for binary systems, the mass function is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i is 1 for eclipsing binaries, it's f(M) = M2^3 / (M_total)^2.

But without knowing which star is more massive, perhaps this approach is not directly helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the masses using the velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, the formula I have is M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So for system_1:

M1a K1a = M2a K2a.

10 M1a =5 M2a → M1a = (5/10) M2a = 0.5 M2a.

Thus, M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, system_2:

M1b K1b = M2b K2b.

15 M1b =10 M2b → M1b = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So, now, I have expressions for M_total1 and M_total2 in terms of M2a and M2b, respectively.

But how do I find the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2?

Wait, maybe I can find M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2a) / ( (5/3) M2b ) ) = (1.5 * 3 /5 ) ( M2a / M2b )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio M2a / M2b.

Wait, perhaps I need another relation. Maybe the orbital period is connected to the masses. The period is given, 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Wait, Kepler's third law in binary systems says that the sum of the masses is related to the cube of the semi-major axis and the square of the period. But the semi-major axis isn't directly given.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) (M2 sin i )/( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + q) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complex. Alternatively, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) * sin i ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + q) )^(2/3) )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * M2 sin i / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the formula for the orbital velocity. The orbital velocity v is given by v = (2π a )/(P), where a is the semi-major axis. For a binary system, each star orbits the center of mass. So, the separation between the two stars is a_total = a1 + a2.

The total mass is M = M1 + M2.

The center of mass condition is M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2 a_total)/(M1 + M2) ) = (M2/(M_total)) a_total.

Similarly, a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a_total.

Each star's velocity is v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So v1 = (2π M2 a_total )/(P M_total )

v2 = (2π M1 a_total )/(P M_total )

But the separation a_total is related to the period and the masses via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

a_total^3 = (G (M1 + M2) P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a_total = [ ( G M_total P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a_total into the expressions for v1 and v2:

v1 = (2 π M2 / (P M_total)) * [ ( G M_total P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute v1:

v1 = (2 π M2 )/(P M_total) * [ (G M_total P^2 )/(4 π^2) ]^(1/3 )

Let me factor out the terms inside the cube root:

[ G M_total P^2 / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (G)^(1/3) (M_total)^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) / (4 π^2)^(1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π M2 )/(P M_total) ) * [ G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Simplify each term:

2 π / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3)) ) = 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) * π^(1/3 )

Because 4=2², so 4^(1/3)=2^(2/3). And 2 / 2^(2/3) )= 2^(1 - 2/3)= 2^(1/3).

So this part becomes 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3 )= (2π)^(1/3 )

So, bringing it all together:

v1 = [ (2 π)^(1/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] * ( M2 ) / ( P M_total )

Wait, let's collect the exponents:

M_total terms: (M_total^(1/3 )) / M_total ) = M_total^(-2/3 )

P terms: P^(2/3 ) / P = P^(-1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2 / ( M_total^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Similarly, v2 would be:

v2 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M1 / ( M_total^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in spectroscopic binaries, only one companion's velocity is measured (the one that's easier to detect, usually the less massive star because it has a larger velocity). But in this problem, both RV amplitudes are given for each system.

So, for system_1:

v1a = 10 km/s, v2a=5 km/s.

Similarly, system_2: v1b=15, v2b=10.

So, for system_1:

v1a = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2a / ( M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

v2a = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M1a / ( M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Dividing v1a by v2a:

v1a / v2a = ( M2a ) / ( M1a )

Which gives M1a / M2a = v2a / v1a = 5/10 = 0.5. Which is consistent with what I found earlier.

Similarly, for system_2: v1b / v2b = ( M2b ) / ( M1b ) → M1b / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

But to find the ratio of the total masses, I need to relate M_total1 and M_total2.

Another approach: perhaps express each M_total in terms of their respective K and P.

Wait, from the expressions above, for each system, the velocities are:

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M2 / ( (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Similarly for v2.

But since in each system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, as we found earlier.

So, M1 = (M2 K2 ) / K1.

Thus, M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 ( K2 / K1 + 1 )

= M2 ( ( K2 + K1 ) / K1 )

So, M2 = M_total * K1 / ( K1 + K2 )

But perhaps I can find a way to express M_total in terms of K and P.

Wait, let's think about the formula for the velocity amplitude K in terms of the orbital parameters.

K = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( ( M_total )^(2/3) (1 + q )^(1/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )

But since i is 90 degrees, sin i =1.

Alternatively, putting it all together, perhaps the mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = ( K1^3 P ) / (241 )

Assuming i=90 degrees, because the system is eclipsing.

Wait, hold on. The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K1 * 29.78 )^3 * P ) / (241 * (1 + q )^2 )

Wait, I'm a bit confused with the constants. Let me look up the mass function formula.

The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K_1^3 ) * P ) / (241 )

But this is when P is in years, K in km/s, and f(M) is in solar masses.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formula is:

f(M) = ( (K_1^3 ) * P ) / ( (241 ) * (1 + q)^2 )

Where q = M2/M1.

But without knowing q, it's hard to find M1 and M2 individually.

Alternatively, for each system, we can write the mass function for each star.

Wait, perhaps for system_1, we have two stars with K1a=10 km/s and K2a=5 km/s.

So for star 1 in system_1, f(M1) = ( (10)^3 * 2 ) / (241 * (1 + q1)^2 )

But q1 is M2a/M1a. From earlier, we have M1a=0.5 M2a → q1 = (M2a)/(0.5 M2a ) ) = 2.

So q1=2.

So for star 1:

f(M1) = (1000 * 2 ) / (241 * (1+2)^2 ) = 2000 / (241 * 9 ) ≈ 2000 / 2169 ≈ 0.922 solar masses.

Similarly, the mass function f(M1) = (M2a^3 ) / ( (M_total1 )^2 )

So,

0.922 = ( M2a^3 ) / ( (M_total1)^2 )

But M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a → M_total1 = 1.5 M2a.

So,

0.922 = ( M2a^3 ) / ( (1.5 M2a )^2 )

Simplify denominator: (1.5)^2 M2a² = 2.25 M2a².

So,

0.922 = M2a^3 / ( 2.25 M2a² ) = M2a / 2.25.

So,

M2a = 0.922 * 2.25 ≈ 2.0745 solar masses.

So M_total1 = 1.5 * M2a ≈ 1.5 * 2.0745 ≈ 3.1118 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2: K1b=15, K2b=10.

So for star 1 in system_2, K1b=15, and K2b=10.

Then, q2 = M2b/M1b = (M2b)/(M1b) = (M2b)/( (M2b * K2b ) / K1b ) )

Wait, from earlier, M1b = (K2b / K1b ) * M2b.

Since K1b=15, K2b=10 → M1b = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

So q2 = M2b / M1b = M2b/( (2/3) M2b ) ) = 3/2 = 1.5.

So, the mass function f(M2) for system_2 is:

f(M2) = ( K2b^3 * P2 ) / (241 * (1 + q2)^2 )

K2b=10, P2=1 year.

So,

f(M2) = (10^3 * 1 ) / (241 * (1 + 1.5 )^2 ) = 1000 / (241 * (2.5)^2 )

(2.5)^2 =6.25.

So denominator is 241 * 6.25 ≈ 241 *6=1446, 241*0.25=60.25 → total 1506.25.

So,

f(M2) ≈ 1000 / 1506.25 ≈ 0.664 solar masses.

But f(M2) is the mass function for star 2, which is f(M2) = M1b^3 / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

So,

0.664 = ( M1b^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

But M1b = (2/3) M2b, and M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

0.664 = ( ( (2/3) M2b )^3 ) / ( ( (5/3) M2b )^2 )

Simplify numerator: (8/27) M2b^3.

Denominator: (25/9) M2b².

So,

0.664 = [ (8/27) M2b^3 ] / [ (25/9) M2b^2 ) ] = (8/27) * M2b / (25/9 )

= (8/27 ) * (9/25) M2b = (8*9)/(27*25) M2b

Simplify:

8*9 =72, 27*25=675 → 72/675 = 24/225 = 8/75.

So,

0.664 = (8/75) * M2b → M2b = 0.664 * (75/8 )

Calculate 75/8 = 9.375 → 0.664 *9.375 ≈ ?

0.664 *9 =5.976, 0.664 *0.375=0.249 → total ≈6.225.

So M2b≈6.225 solar masses.

Then, M_total2 = (5/3) M2b ≈ (5/3)*6.225 ≈ 10.375 solar masses.

So, M_total1 ≈3.1118, M_total2≈10.375.

So, the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 ≈ 3.1118 / 10.375 ≈0.30.

Wait, that's about 0.3, but looking at the options, the closest is option A ~0.4, or option D ~0.7.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass function for system_2.

Wait, in system_2, for star 2, K2b=10, but the mass function formula is:

f(M) = (K^3 * P ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 )

But which K do I use? For system_2, star 1 has K1b=15, star 2 K2b=10.

Wait, the mass function for each star is different. So for star 1 in system_2, K1=15, and q2= M2b/M1b=1.5.

So f(M1) for star 1 would be:

f(M1) = (15^3 * 1 ) / (241 * (1 + 1.5 )^2 )

15^3=3375.

Denominator:241 *6.25≈1506.25.

So f(M1)=3375/1506.25 ≈ 2.239.

But f(M1) is M2b^3 / (M_total2)^2.

So,

2.239 = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b ) + M2b = (5/3 M2b ).

So,

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

2.239 = M2b^3 / ( (5/3 M2b )^2 )

Simplify denominator: (25/9) M2b².

So,

2.239 = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (25/9) M2b² ) ) = (9 M2b ) /25.

So,

(9 M2b ) /25 =2.239 → M2b = (2.239 *25 ) /9 ≈ 55.975 /9 ≈6.219 solar masses.

M_total2 = (5/3) *6.219 ≈10.365.

So M_total1 is 3.1118, M_total2 is approximately 10.365.

So ratio M_total1 / M_total2 =3.1118 /10.365 ≈ 0.300.

Hmm, that's about 0.3, which is not one of the options. The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the mass function. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have used the mass function but another approach.

Wait, another approach: using the formula M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So, for system_1:

M1a K1a = M2a K2a → M1a *10 = M2a *5 → M1a = 0.5 M2a.

Total mass M_total1 = M1a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, system_2:

M1b K1b = M2b K2b → M1b *15 = M2b *10 → M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = M1b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the other thing we know is that the period is related to the masses and the separation. Using Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π²/G(M_total)) * a^3.

But a is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2.

But a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a.

a2 = (M1/(M_total)) * a.

But a = a1 + a2 = a.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of velocities and the period.

The orbital speed v is 2π a / (P sin i ), which for i=90 is 2π a/P.

But since the velocities are K1 and K2, we have:

K1 = (2 π a1 ) / P.

Similarly, K2 = (2 π a2 )/ P.

But a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a, a2 = (M1/(M_total)) a.

So,

K1 = (2 π (M2 a) )/(M_total P )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π (M1 a) )/( M_total P )

Multiply K1 and K2:

K1 K2 = (4 π² (M1 M2 a² ) ) / ( M_total² P² )

But from Kepler's third law,

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_total )

Rearranged,

a³ = ( G M_total P² )/(4 π² )

So,

a² = [ ( G M_total P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(2/3 )

= G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) )

Substituting back into the product K1 K2:

K1 K2 = (4 π² (M1 M2 ) ) / ( M_total² P² ) * [ G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) ) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) ) ) ]

Simplify:

4 π² / (M_total² P² ) * G^(2/3) M_total^(2/3) P^(4/3) / (4^(2/3) π^(4/3) )

= 4/(4^(2/3)) ) * ( π² / π^(4/3) ) * ( G^(2/3) ) * ( M_total^(2/3) / M_total² ) * ( P^(4/3) / P^2 )

Simplify each term:

4 / (4^(2/3)) = 4^(1 - 2/3) )=4^(1/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)=2^(2/3) ≈1.5874.

π² / π^(4/3) = π^(2 -4/3)= π^(2/3) ≈2.145.

G^(2/3) = (6.674×10^-11 )^(2/3), but perhaps we don't need the actual value since we're taking ratios.

M_total^(2/3) / M_total² = M_total^(-4/3 )

P^(4/3)/ P^2 = P^(-2/3 )

So putting it all together:

K1 K2 = 2^(2/3) * π^(2/3) * G^(2/3) * M1 M2 * M_total^(-4/3) * P^(-2/3 ) 

But M1 M2 = M_total^2 - (M1 - M2 )^2 ≈ M_total^2 for M1≈M2, but perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the product K1 K2 is proportional to (M1 M2 )^(1) * ( M_total )^(-4/3 ) * P^(-2/3 )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe it's better to take the ratio of the total masses.

We have M_total1 =1.5 M2a.

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

But we need to find M_total1 / M_total2.

Wait, but without knowing M2a and M2b, how?

Wait, perhaps we can set up a ratio between the two systems using the relations.

From system_1:

M1a = 0.5 M2a.

So M_total1 = 1.5 M2a.

From system_2:

M1b = (2/3) M2b.

M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2a ) / ( (5/3) M2b ) ) = ( (3/2) M2a ) / (5/3 M2b ) ) = (9 M2a ) / (10 M2b )

So, M_total1 / M_total2 = (9/10 ) ( M2a / M2b )

But we don't know M2a and M2b. So how?

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation between M2a and M2b.

I recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to mass and period.

From the formula: K = [ (G M_total )/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ] * [ (2 π )/( P ) ] * [ M_companion sin i ] / ( M_total )^(2/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * ( M_companion sin i ) / ( ( M_total )^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Again, i=90°, so sin i=1.

So for system_1, star 1 has K1a=10 km/s, and its companion is M2a.

So,

10 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2a / ( ( M_total1 )^(2/3) (2 years )^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2, star 1 has K1b=15, companion M2b, period 1 year.

15 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2b / ( ( M_total2 )^(2/3) (1 year )^(1/3) )

Dividing the two equations:

10 /15 = [ M2a / M_total1^(2/3) (2)^(1/3) ) ] / [ M2b / M_total2^(2/3) (1)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

2/3 = [ (M2a M_total2^(2/3) ) / ( M2b M_total1^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) ) ]

We can rearrange this to:

( M2a / M2b ) = (2/3 ) * ( M_total1^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) / ( M_total2^(2/3) )

But from earlier, M_total1 = 1.5 M2a and M_total2 = (5/3) M2b.

So,

M_total1 =1.5 M2a → M_total1^(2/3) = (1.5)^(2/3) * M2a^(2/3 )

Similarly, M_total2 = (5/3) M2b → M_total2^(2/3) = (5/3)^(2/3) * M2b^(2/3 )

Substituting into the equation:

( M2a / M2b ) = (2/3 ) * [ (1.5^(2/3) M2a^(2/3) ) * 2^(1/3) ) ] / [ (5/3)^(2/3) M2b^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify:

Left side: M2a / M2b.

Right side: (2/3) * [ 1.5^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) / (5/3)^(2/3) ) ] * [ (M2a^(2/3)) / (M2b^(2/3) ) ) ]

Which is:

[2/3 ] * [ (1.5^2 * 2 )^(1/3) / ( (5/3)^2 )^(1/3) ) ] * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Wait, let me compute the constants:

Compute 1.5^2 = 2.25. So 2.25 *2 =4.5.

(5/3)^2 =25/9 ≈2.7778.

So,

(4.5 ) / (25/9 ) ) = 4.5 *9 /25 = (40.5)/25 = 1.62.

But each is raised to 1/3 power.

So,

(4.5/ (25/9 ))^(1/3) = (1.62 )^(1/3) ≈1.175.

Wait, 1.62^(1/3) is approximately 1.175 because 1.175^3 ≈1.62.

So,

Right side becomes:

(2/3 ) * 1.175 * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Putting it all together:

M2a / M2b = (2/3) * 1.175 * ( M2a / M2b )^(2/3 )

Let’s let x = ( M2a / M2b )

So,

x = (2/3) * 1.175 * x^(2/3 )

Divide both sides by x^(2/3 ):

x^(1 - 2/3 ) = (2/3 *1.175 )

x^(1/3 ) = (2 *1.175 )/(3 )

2 *1.175=2.35; 2.35/3≈0.7833.

So,

x^(1/3 ) ≈0.7833 → x ≈ (0.7833 )^3 ≈0.7833 *0.7833 =0.6135, *0.7833≈0.481.

So x≈0.481 → M2a / M2b=0.481.

Now, back to M_total1 / M_total2.

Which is (9/10 ) * ( M2a / M2b ) ≈ (9/10)*0.481 ≈0.4329.

So approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4.

So the factor is system_1 is about 0.4 times more massive than system_2.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

So if system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, then system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is 2.5 times more massive. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the ratio is M_total1 / M_total2 ≈0.43.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

So the factor is ~0.4, which is option A.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, masses, and orbital periods.

### Key Observations and Relationships:
1. **Mass Ratio and Radial Velocities**:  
   In a binary system, the mass ratio \( q = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \) is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes:  
   \[
   q = \frac{K_2}{K_1}
   \]  
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.

2. **Total Mass**:  
   The total mass of the system is the sum of the individual masses:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2
   \]  
   Using the mass ratio \( q \), the total mass can be expressed as:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q} \right)
   \]

3. **Mass Function**:  
   The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes, orbital period, and total mass:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{241 \, (1 + q)^2}
   \]  
   For eclipsing binaries, the inclination \( i \approx 90^\circ \), so \( \sin i \approx 1 \).

### Analysis of System_1:
- **Velocity Amplitudes**: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- **Mass Ratio**:  
  \[
  q_1 = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
  \]  
- **Total Mass**:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q_1} \right) = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{0.5} \right) = 1.5 M_2
  \]

### Analysis of System_2:
- **Velocity Amplitudes**: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- **Mass Ratio**:  
  \[
  q_2 = \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{10}{15} = 0.6667
  \]  
- **Total Mass**:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{q_2} \right) = M_2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{0.6667} \right) = 1.5 M_2
  \]

### Ratio of Total Masses:
The ratio of the total masses is given by:  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 M_{2,1}}{1.5 M_{2,2}} = \frac{M_{2,1}}{M_{2,2}}
\]  
To find \( \frac{M_{2,1}}{M_{2,2}} \), we use the mass function and the fact that the periods are \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}, P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \). After detailed calculations, the ratio is found to be approximately:  
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} \approx 0.4
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2. This corresponds to **option A**.

ANSWER: A
