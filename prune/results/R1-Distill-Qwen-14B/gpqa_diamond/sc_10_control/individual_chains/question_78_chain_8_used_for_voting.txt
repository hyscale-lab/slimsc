Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge q. 

So, from what I remember, when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the potentials are related to these fields, right? So the scalar potential gives the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and at time t, the field is observed at point r. There's a vector d which is the distance from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, because fields propagate at the speed of light, tr would be the time when the field left the charge and is now arriving at r. So t is later than tr, meaning the charge's velocity v is at time tr.

I think the potentials are given by retarded time expressions. Right, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, adjusted for the time it takes for the field to travel to the observation point.

Let me recall the formulas. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is something like V = q/(4πε0) * [1/(r')] where r' is the distance at the retarded time. Wait, but in this problem, d is the vector from the retarded position to r. So maybe r is the current position, but the charge was at a different point earlier. So the distance would be |d|, right?

Wait, no. Let's think. The point where the field was generated is at position s(tr), and the observation point is r. So the vector from the field's origin to r is d = r - s(tr). So the distance is |d|, I guess.

So the scalar potential V(r, t) should be q/(4πε0) multiplied by 1 over the distance d, but wait, I remember that when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Oh wait, no, wait. The scalar potential is only dependent on the charge's position, not its velocity, I think. Or is that correct?

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge has a term due to the electric field. The electric field of a moving charge is not just the static Coulomb field, but there's also a term involving the velocity. Or does the scalar potential only involve the charge's position at the retarded time?

I think the scalar potential V is given by V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|d|)] / [1 - (v·d̂)/c²], where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Wait, why that denominator? Because of the relativistic effects or maybe the way the potentials transform? Alternatively, it could be 1/(|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c²)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (dc - d·v) or something similar. Let me see. Let me write d as the vector from the retarded position to r. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator in the options is (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v). Hmm. Wait, maybe the denominator is (c times |d|) minus (d·v), because v is the velocity at tr, and |d| is the distance.

Wait, but the denominator in the options is written as "d c - vec{d} · vec{v}". So that's (d c) minus (d · v). Wait, but d is a vector, so maybe it's |d| c minus (d · v), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is c times |d| minus the dot product of d and v. Hmm.

So looking at the options, option C has (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Option D has (d c + d·v).

Wait, but what is the correct expression for the potentials. Let's think about the general form for scalar and vector potentials from a moving charge.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r' + v' t)], where r' is the position at t', and v' is the velocity. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c²)]^{-1} or something like that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r - (v/c²) tr)] or something involving the velocity. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the Liénard potentials.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by A(r, t) = (μ0 q/(4π c²)) [ (v/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, none have that exact form. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions for V and A that have denominators involving (d c - d · v) or similar.

Wait, let me think in terms of units. The denominator should be a length. So (d c) is a vector multiplied by c (which is m/s), so that's meters squared per second? No, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - d · v), which is meters minus (meters × (m/s) × (m/s))? Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's write d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). The magnitude of d is |d| = sqrt( d_x² + d_y² + d_z² ). The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at time tr.

Hmm, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v) but wait, d is a vector, so it's a vector equation. But the denominator in a potential must be a scalar, so perhaps that's not right. Wait, no, wait: option C shows the denominator as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), which is a scalar because both terms are products of scalars. Because d c is |d| multiplied by c? Wait, no, because d is a vector, but in the denominator it's written as (d c - ...). Hmm, perhaps the correct expression is (c |d| - (d · v)) in the denominator.

So for V, the expression would be q/(4πε0) multiplied by c/(c |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the correct expressions for V and A when a charge is moving.

The scalar potential V is given by the static potential plus a term due to the motion. Wait, actually, the scalar potential is only due to the charge's position, right? Or does the velocity contribute? Hmm, I think the scalar potential V(r,t) is given by (q/(4πε0)) [1/(c t - |r - s(tr)|)] / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ), which simplifies or not? Alternatively, perhaps the expression is V = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A(r,t) is (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) [1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, so let's see. If the denominator in V is d c - (d · v), perhaps that's equivalent to |d| c - (d · v). Because d is a vector, so (d · v) is the scalar product. So for example, if d is in the same direction as v, then (d · v) is |d| v. So the denominator would be |d| c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). But that's only the case if d and v are in the same direction.

Wait, but perhaps the denominator is written as |d| (c - v·d̂ ), but that's not exactly the same as what's in the option. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the denominator as (c |d| - (d · v)).

So let's proceed. Let me think about the standard expressions.

The scalar potential V(r, t) for a charge moving with velocity v is:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε0) ] * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 − (v · d̂)/c² ) ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A(r, t) would be:

A(r, t) = [ μ0 q / (4π) ] * [ (v) / (1 − (v · d̂)/c² ) ] / c²

Wait, but in the options, option C has V as qc/(4πε0 (dc - d·v)) and A as (μ0 qc v)/(4π (dc - d·v)).

Hmm. Let me compute this denominator. Let's say dc is |d| multiplied by c. Then, the denominator in V is |d| c - (d · v). So,

V = (q c) / [4πε0 ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ]

Similarly, A is (μ0 q c v) / [4π ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ]

Wait, but why is there a c in the numerator for V? Because in this expression, V is given as (q c ) times 1/( denominator ), but that doesn't seem to fit with the standard expression I have.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Another approach: let's recall that the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = ( q / (4πε0) ) * ( 1 / |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ]

And A(r,t) = (μ0 q / (4π c² )) * ( v ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ]

But to make this match the options, perhaps I should express this in terms of (d c - d · v). Let me consider the denominator.

The denominator in V's expression is |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) = ( |d| - (v·d̂)/c² * |d| )

Wait, but (v·d̂) is v · (d/|d|) ) = (v · d) / |d|.

So, 1 - (v·d̂)/c² = [ c² |d| - v·d ] / (c² |d| )

Hmm, wait:

1 - (v·d̂)/c² = [ c² - (v·d̂) |d| ] / c².

Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it properly.

v·d̂ = (v · d)/|d|.

So 1 - (v·d̂)/c² = 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )

Multiply numerator and denominator by |d|:

= [ c² |d| - (v · d) ] / (c² |d| )

So, 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) = (c² |d| ) / [ c² |d| - (v · d) ]

So, putting this back into V:

V = [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ 1 / |d| ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Simplify:

The |d| in the denominator cancels with |d| in the numerator:

= [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ c² ] / [ c² |d| - (v · d) ]

So,

V = [ q c² ] / [4πε0 ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's V is [ q c ] / [4πε0 (d c - v · d ) ]

Hmm. So in option C, the denominator is (d c - v · d ), but in our calculation, it's (c^2 |d| - v · d ).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the denominator, it's (c² |d| - v · d ). Let me factor out |d| in the denominator.

= |d| ( c² - (v · d̂ ) c² / |d| )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using different terms.

Wait, looking again at option C:

V = [ q c ] / [4 π ε0 (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) ]

Which is,

V = (q c ) / [4 π ε0 ( c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

But in our calculation, V is [ q c^2 ] / [4 π ε0 ( c^2 |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Hmm, so the denominator is the same, but the numerator in option C is q c, while our calculation has q c².

So perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is the same as (c |d| - v·d).

So,

V = [q/(4πε0)] * [1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ]

Which is,

= [ q/(4πε0 (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ] * (1/|d| )

But as we established, [1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )] = (c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, substituting,

V = [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - d · v) ) ] * (1/|d| )

The |d| cancels:

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 (c² |d| - (d · v)) ]

Hmm, so V is ( q c^2 ) / denominator.

But in option C, V is ( q c ) / denominator.

So, this doesn't match. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait another approach: the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r,t) = ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [ 1 / ( 1 - (v · r̂ ) / c² ) ]

Where r̂ is the unit vector from the charge to the observation point at the retarded time.

So,

V(r,t) = ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v · (d/|d|) )/c² ) ) ]

= ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v · d )/(c² |d|) )) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by c² |d|:

= ( q c² ) / [4 π ε0 |d| ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which is,

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 ( |d| (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait: denominator is |d| multiplied by (c² |d| - (v · d) ), so,

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 ( |d| (c^2 |d| - v · d) ) ]

Hmm, that's still not matching the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by:

A(r,t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Which, as before, is:

A(r,t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

So,

A = ( μ0 q v c² |d| ) / [4 π c² (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

The c² cancels:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| ) / [4 π (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but in option C, A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π (d c - v · d ) )

So,

Compare with my expression:

A = [ μ0 q v |d| ] / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Hmm. The numerator in option C is μ0 q c v, and denominator is ( c |d| - (v · d) )

Wait, but in my expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - (v · d) )

So, unless the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which is different.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (c |d| - (v · d) ), but according to what I did earlier, it's (c² |d| - (v · d) )

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently.

Wait, another approach: the general expression for the scalar potential of a moving charge is:

V(r,t) = \dfrac{ q }{4\pi \epsilon_0 } \cdot \dfrac{1}{ |r - \vec{r}'(t_r)| } \cdot \dfrac{1}{1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v}(t_r) \cdot \hat{r}' }{c^2} }

Where r' is r - s(tr) = d.

So,

= ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² ) ) ]

Which is,

= q/(4 π ε0 ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² ) ) )

Let me write this as:

= q/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/( 1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= q/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So,

= q c² / [4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So V is [ q c² ] / denominator.

But in the options, option C's V is [ q c ] / denominator, which is missing a c in the numerator.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the expression for V.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d). Wait, if d is a vector, then d c is |d| c.

So, denominator in option C is ( |d| c - (d · v) )

So,

V = ( q c ) / ( 4 π ε0 ( |d| c - (d · v) ) )

But according to my calculation, it should be ( q c² ) / (denominator ). So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the expressions wrong. Let me think about the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by:

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Which, as before, is,

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Again, the c² cancels:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

But in option C, A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d) ) )

So the denominator is different, and the numerator has an extra c.

Hmm. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Lorentz gauge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a miscalculation, but I have to choose from them.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: V = qc/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), A = (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c -d·v))

Option D: V = qc/(4πε0 (d c +d·v)), A = (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c +d·v))

So, denominator in C is (c |d| - d·v ), and in D it's (c |d| +d·v )

Which one makes sense?

From the earlier expressions, the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which is not the same as any options, but perhaps the options are using a different notation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the expressions in the options.

Option B: V is (q)/(4π ε0 r), which is just the Coulomb potential, implying a static charge, so that's probably incorrect because the charge is moving.

Option A: V is same as B, and A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Option C and D have denominators involving (d c ± d · v ), which could be a form of (c |d| ± v·d )

So, considering that, perhaps the correct equations have denominators (c |d| - v·d ), which would be option C.

Alternatively, what's the denominator for the Liénard potentials.

Wait, according to Liénard's expressions, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) [ 1/( r_t ) ] [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Where r_t is the distance at the retarded time.

Wait, but r_t is |r - s(tr)|.

So,

V = (q)/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which is,

= q/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, V = q c² / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

Hmm, but none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector potential. Let me recall that the vector potential A is (μ0/(4π c²)) times the velocity times the same denominator term.

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which gives,

= (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Simplify,

= (μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

Again, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking at option C:

V(r,t) = qc/(4 π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Which is,

V = (q c )/(4 π ε0 ( c |d| - (d · v) ) )

Compare to our expression: V = ( q c² ) / [ 4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, the denominator is similar, but the numerator in option C has only a single c, while according to our calculation, it has c squared.

So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere, but I can't spot where.

Alternatively, perhaps the expressions in the options are using a different form, like expressing the denominator as (c d - d · v ), where d is |d|.

So, denominator becomes (c |d| - (d · v) )

Hmm. Let me check the units to see which option makes sense.

V has units of volts, which is joules per coulomb (J/C). But since it's an electric potential, V = (1/(4πε0)) (q / r) in the static case, so the units check out.

Looking at option C:

V = (q c ) / (4 π ε0 (c |d| - d·v) )

The denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which has units of (m/s * m) - (m/s * m/s * m) = m²/s - m^3/s^2 → Not sure, but perhaps it should have units of meters. Let's compute the denominator's units:

c has units m/s, |d| is m, so c|d| is m^2/s. d·v is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator has (m²/s - m²/s) → dimensionless? No, no, that can't be. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, c|d| is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. d·v is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s - m²/s ), which is zero? That can't be right. So that suggests that option C's denominator has the same units as m²/s, which in the denominator would make V's units (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) → (C) / (m ), which is correct for electric potential (V = J/C, J= N m → V= (N m)/C = (kg m^2/s² ) m / C → kg m^2/(s² C), but Coulomb is (A s ), so kg m^2/(s^3 A ) → which is Volts. So units do check out.

Wait, but the denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which is m²/s. So the denominator in V is m²/s. So the numerator is q c, which is Coulomb * (m/s). So,

[ (C)(m/s) ) ] / [ (m²/s) ) ] → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C/(m ), which is Volts. Correct.

Similarly for A:

Option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d·v) )

μ0 has units H/m (henrys per meter), which is (kg m/(s² A² )).

So,

μ0 q c v: [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * [ C ] * [ m/s ] * [ m/s ].

But C is equal to A s, so:

= [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * [ A s ] * (m/s) * (m/s )

= [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * A s * m²/s²

= kg m^3/(s^3 A )

Denominator is [ (m²/s) ) ]

So,

A = [ kg m^3/(s^3 A ) ] / [ m²/s ) ] = [ kg m^3/(s^3 A ) ] * [ s/m² ]

= kg m/(s^2 A )

But the unit of A is Tesla·m² (since B = ∇ × A, and B in Tesla is kg/(s² A ) ).

Hmm, let me compute the units again.

Wait, the unit of A is T·m²? No, the unit of vector potential A is Tesla multiplied by meter squared? Or not. Let me think. Tesla is kg/(s² A). So, if A has units of (kg m)/(s² A ), that's Tesla multiplied by m.

Wait, but the vector potential's unit is indeed kg m/(s² A ), which equals (kg·m/s² )·s²/(A·m ) ) → which is (N·s² )/(A·m ) → Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost.

But regardless, the units for option C's A seem to work out.

So, perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, the denominator in the vector potential for option C is (c |d| - d·v ), which, from our earlier calculation, that's different from the denominator we have (c² |d| - d·v ), but if the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v) ), and in our calculation, denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), then none of the options would match, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me go back to the standard expressions.

Wait, I think I remember that the potentials can be written using the terms (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So,

V(r, t) = ( q/(4 π ε0 ) ) * ( 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² ) ) )

Which,

= ( q/(4 π ε0 ) ) * ( c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - d · v )

So,

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Similarly, A is:

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * ( c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - d · v )

Which,

= (μ0 q v |d| ) / (4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm. So none of the options have this form, but option C has:

V = ( q c ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which would require that the denominator in our expression is (c |d| - d · v ), but according to our calculation, it's ( c² |d| - d · v )

Unless I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should go back to the thought process.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, the term is (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that would imply that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), so the correct option would have this denominator.

Looking back, in option C, denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and in option D, it's (c |d| + d · v )

Wait, but from the earlier expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), which is different.

So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but since I have to choose from the given options, I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) )

Let me reevaluate the expression for V.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, it's (c |d| - (d · v) ) but multiplied by something else.

Wait, let's consider the case where the charge is moving directly towards the observation point. So, d and v are in the same direction. So, d · v = |d| v.

So, the denominator would be (c |d| - |d| v ) = |d| (c - v )

In that case, V would be:

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Hmm. If that's the case, but if in the options, the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which in this case is |d| (c - v ), then V becomes ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( |d| (c - v ) ) ), which is ( q c² )/( 4 π ε0 |d| (c-v) )

But none of the options have c squared in the numerator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is (c |d| - d · v )

But according to that, in our case when d and v are in the same direction, denominator is |d| (c - v ), so V would be (q c² )/(4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Which is the same as ( q c² )/(4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formulation. Let me look for an alternative approach.

Another way: in the context of retarded potentials, the fields are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, such that the emitted fields travel at speed c to reach the observation point r at time t.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( r' ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r.

Again, r' is |d|.

So,

V = ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ]

= ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

So, this is the same as before.

But the options don't have this expression.

Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of d as a vector with magnitude, but expressed differently.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - d · v ), which is ( |d| c - d · v ).

But according to our expression, the denominator is ( c² |d| - d · v )

So, unless option C's denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which would not match our calculation, but let's check.

So, if the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), then our expression would be:

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

But in option C, V is ( q c ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

So, our expression has an extra c in the numerator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for V. Let me think again.

Another approach: let's assume that the denominator in the options is correct, and see which option makes sense.

Option C:

V = ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) ]

A = ( μ0 q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) ]

So, for units, V is volts, which should be (J/C ), which is (N·m)/C.

Option C's V: numerator is q c → C * (m/s )

Denominator is ( m/s * m ) - ( m²/s ) → m²/s - m²/s → zero? No, can't be.

Wait, no, the denominator in V is ( c |d| - (d ⋅ v) ), which is (m/s * m ) - (m * m/s ) → both terms are m²/s.

So denominator units are m²/s.

So, V's units are (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) ) → (C * m/s ) * s/(m² ) → C/( m ), which is correct for volts (V = J/C, and J = N m = kg m²/s² → V = kg m²/(s² C) )

But with option C's denominator, the denominator has units of m²/s, so the numerator (q c ) has units (C)(m/s ), so overall units (C m/s )/( m² /s ) ) → C/(m ), which is correct.

Similarly, for A, the numerator is μ0 q c v → (H/m ) * C * (m/s ) * (m/s ) → H is kg m/(s² A² ), so:

( kg m/(s² A² ) ) * C * m/s * m/s → kg m/(s² A² ) * C * m²/s² → kg m^3/(s^4 A² )

Denominator is ( m²/s )

So, A has units kg m^3/(s^4 A² ) / ( m²/s ) → kg m/(s^3 A² )

Wait, but the unit of vector potential A is T·m, since B is measured in Tesla (kg/(s² A ) ), and B = ∇×A → so A must have units (kg·m)/(s² A )

Wait, my calculation gives kg m/(s^3 A² ), which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct despite the earlier confusion.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the expressions of V and A.

In option C, V is proportional to c, and A is proportional to c v.

In our earlier calculation, V is proportional to c², and A is proportional to v |d|.

So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about a specific case. For example, if the charge is stationary, then v is zero.

In that case, the denominator becomes c |d|.

So,

V should be ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ), which is correct for a static charge.

Looking at the options:

- Option B: V is (q)/(4π ε0 r ), which is correct for a static charge, but the vector potential A is (v/c² ) V. But if v is zero, then A is zero, which is correct. So option B would be correct for a static charge.

But the question states that the charge is moving, so the potentials shouldn't be the same as static case.

Wait, but in option B, A would be zero because v is zero, which is correct for a static charge. But for a moving charge, option B's A is non-zero.

But the question is about a moving charge, so option B is probably incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, because when the charge isn't moving (v =0 ), then the denominator is c |d|, and V becomes ( q c )/(4 π ε0 c |d| ) → q/(4 π ε0 |d| ), which is correct. So, for static charge, option C gives correct V.

Similarly, A would be (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| ) ) → (μ0 q v )/(4 π c ), which for v=0 gives A=0, correct.

So, option C gives correct expressions when v=0.

But when v is not zero, does the denominator make sense?

Hmm, in our earlier derivation, the denominator is (c² |d| - d·v ), but option C's denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which would be different.

But when v is not zero, perhaps option C's denominator is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator derivation. Let me recheck.

In the denominator, 1 - (v · d̂ )/c² = [ c² |d| - (d · v) ] / (c² |d| )

So,

V = [ q/(4 π ε0) ] * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * (c² |d| ) / (c² |d| - d · v )

Which,

= [ q c² ] / (4 π ε0 (c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm. So, according to this, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), but none of the options have that.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is written as (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is option C, but the numerator in V is missing a c.

Wait, perhaps the expressions in the options are using a different scaling. For example, perhaps they have absorbed a factor of c into the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential's expression. The vector potential for a moving charge is:

A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

= ( μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

So, the vector potential's denominator is same as V's.

Looking at the options, option C's A is:

(μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which would mean that denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which doesn't match our expression unless I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector potential. Let me think again.

Another approach: The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. The magnetic field due to a moving charge is given by Ampère's law, but considering relativistic effects.

The magnetic field B is (μ0 q v × r̂ ) / (4 π c² |r|² (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) )

But r is the position vector at the retarded time. So, r = d.

So,

B = (μ0 q (v × d̂ ) ) / (4 π c² |d|² (1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) )

The vector potential A is given by B = ∇ × A. For a point charge, A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ r̂ / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, according to the standard expression, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ] r̂

Which, in terms of d, is:

A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ] * (d/|d| )

So,

A = ( μ0 q v d )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ]

Simplify:

A = ( μ0 q v d )/(4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

But d is a vector, so d = |d| d̂.

So,

A = ( μ0 q v |d| d̂ )/(4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm, which is similar to the expression in option C, except for the denominator.

Wait, option C's A is:

(μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm, so the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and the numerator is (μ0 q c v )

In our expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), and the numerator is (μ0 q v |d| )

So, to match option C, we'd need:

- The denominator to be (c |d| - d · v )

- The numerator to have an extra c and |d| missing.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and then the vector potential would be:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which is different from option C.

But according to the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| -d · v ) )

So, our expression for A would have |d| in the numerator and option C doesn't.

So, that's another discrepancy.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here, but based on the earlier analysis where option C gives correct static case and the denominator structure, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded time formalism in electromagnetism. The charge \( q \) moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The denominator in the potentials is expected to involve terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is the static Coulomb potential.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   This option assumes a static charge, which is inconsistent with the moving charge scenario. The vector potential does not match the expected form for a moving charge. **Incorrect**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), again representing a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   While the vector potential form is plausible for a moving charge, the scalar potential is static and does not account for the motion of the charge. **Incorrect**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) matches the expected structure for retarded potentials. The scalar and vector potentials are consistent with the motion of the charge, and the static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) reduces correctly to the Coulomb potential and zero vector potential. **Correct**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the expected form for retarded potentials, as it does not account for the relativistic correction properly. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded time formalism and the motion of the charge. The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) aligns with the expected structure, and the static case is recovered correctly.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge q. 

So, from what I remember, when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the potentials are related to these fields, right? So the scalar potential gives the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and at time t, the field is observed at point r. There's a vector d which is the distance from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, because fields propagate at the speed of light, tr would be the time when the field left the charge and is now arriving at r. So t is later than tr, meaning the charge's velocity v is at time tr.

I think the potentials are given by retarded time expressions. Right, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, adjusted for the time it takes for the field to travel to the observation point.

Let me recall the formulas. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is something like V = q/(4πε0) * [1/(r')] where r' is the distance at the retarded time. Wait, but in this problem, d is the vector from the retarded position to r. So maybe r is the current position, but the charge was at a different point earlier. So the distance would be |d|, right?

Wait, no. Let's think. The point where the field was generated is at position s(tr), and the observation point is r. So the vector from the field's origin to r is d = r - s(tr). So the distance is |d|, I guess.

So the scalar potential V(r, t) should be q/(4πε0) multiplied by 1 over the distance d, but wait, I remember that when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Oh wait, no, wait. The scalar potential is only dependent on the charge's position, not its velocity, I think. Or is that correct?

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge has a term due to the electric field. The electric field of a moving charge is not just the static Coulomb field, but there's also a term involving the velocity. Or does the scalar potential only involve the charge's position at the retarded time?

I think the scalar potential V is given by V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|d|)] / [1 - (v·d̂)/c²], where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Wait, why that denominator? Because of the relativistic effects or maybe the way the potentials transform? Alternatively, it could be 1/(|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c²)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (dc - d·v) or something similar. Let me see. Let me write d as the vector from the retarded position to r. So d = r - s(tr). So the denominator in the options is (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v). Hmm. Wait, maybe the denominator is (c times |d|) minus (d·v), because v is the velocity at tr, and |d| is the distance.

Wait, but the denominator in the options is written as "d c - vec{d} · vec{v}". So that's (d c) minus (d · v). Wait, but d is a vector, so maybe it's |d| c minus (d · v), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is c times |d| minus the dot product of d and v. Hmm.

So looking at the options, option C has (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Option D has (d c + d·v).

Wait, but what is the correct expression for the potentials. Let's think about the general form for scalar and vector potentials from a moving charge.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r' + v' t)], where r' is the position at t', and v' is the velocity. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c²)]^{-1} or something like that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(r - (v/c²) tr)] or something involving the velocity. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the Liénard potentials.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by A(r, t) = (μ0 q/(4π c²)) [ (v/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, none have that exact form. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions for V and A that have denominators involving (d c - d · v) or similar.

Wait, let me think in terms of units. The denominator should be a length. So (d c) is a vector multiplied by c (which is m/s), so that's meters squared per second? No, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - d · v), which is meters minus (meters × (m/s) × (m/s))? Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's write d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). The magnitude of d is |d| = sqrt( d_x² + d_y² + d_z² ). The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at time tr.

Hmm, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v) but wait, d is a vector, so it's a vector equation. But the denominator in a potential must be a scalar, so perhaps that's not right. Wait, no, wait: option C shows the denominator as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), which is a scalar because both terms are products of scalars. Because d c is |d| multiplied by c? Wait, no, because d is a vector, but in the denominator it's written as (d c - ...). Hmm, perhaps the correct expression is (c |d| - (d · v)) in the denominator.

So for V, the expression would be q/(4πε0) multiplied by c/(c |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the correct expressions for V and A when a charge is moving.

The scalar potential V is given by the static potential plus a term due to the motion. Wait, actually, the scalar potential is only due to the charge's position, right? Or does the velocity contribute? Hmm, I think the scalar potential V(r,t) is given by (q/(4πε0)) [1/(c t - |r - s(tr)|)] / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ), which simplifies or not? Alternatively, perhaps the expression is V = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ].

Similarly, the vector potential A(r,t) is (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) [1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, so let's see. If the denominator in V is d c - (d · v), perhaps that's equivalent to |d| c - (d · v). Because d is a vector, so (d · v) is the scalar product. So for example, if d is in the same direction as v, then (d · v) is |d| v. So the denominator would be |d| c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). But that's only the case if d and v are in the same direction.

Wait, but perhaps the denominator is written as |d| (c - v·d̂ ), but that's not exactly the same as what's in the option. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the denominator as (c |d| - (d · v)).

So let's proceed. Let me think about the standard expressions.

The scalar potential V(r, t) for a charge moving with velocity v is:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε0) ] * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 − (v · d̂)/c² ) ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A(r, t) would be:

A(r, t) = [ μ0 q / (4π) ] * [ (v) / (1 − (v · d̂)/c² ) ] / c²

Wait, but in the options, option C has V as qc/(4πε0 (dc - d·v)) and A as (μ0 qc v)/(4π (dc - d·v)).

Hmm. Let me compute this denominator. Let's say dc is |d| multiplied by c. Then, the denominator in V is |d| c - (d · v). So,

V = (q c) / [4πε0 ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ]

Similarly, A is (μ0 q c v) / [4π ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ]

Wait, but why is there a c in the numerator for V? Because in this expression, V is given as (q c ) times 1/( denominator ), but that doesn't seem to fit with the standard expression I have.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Another approach: let's recall that the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = ( q / (4πε0) ) * ( 1 / |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ]

And A(r,t) = (μ0 q / (4π c² )) * ( v ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ]

But to make this match the options, perhaps I should express this in terms of (d c - d · v). Let me consider the denominator.

The denominator in V's expression is |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) = ( |d| - (v·d̂)/c² * |d| )

Wait, but (v·d̂) is v · (d/|d|) ) = (v · d) / |d|.

So, 1 - (v·d̂)/c² = [ c² |d| - v·d ] / (c² |d| )

Hmm, wait:

1 - (v·d̂)/c² = [ c² - (v·d̂) |d| ] / c².

Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it properly.

v·d̂ = (v · d)/|d|.

So 1 - (v·d̂)/c² = 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d| )

Multiply numerator and denominator by |d|:

= [ c² |d| - (v · d) ] / (c² |d| )

So, 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) = (c² |d| ) / [ c² |d| - (v · d) ]

So, putting this back into V:

V = [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ 1 / |d| ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Simplify:

The |d| in the denominator cancels with |d| in the numerator:

= [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ c² ] / [ c² |d| - (v · d) ]

So,

V = [ q c² ] / [4πε0 ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's V is [ q c ] / [4πε0 (d c - v · d ) ]

Hmm. So in option C, the denominator is (d c - v · d ), but in our calculation, it's (c^2 |d| - v · d ).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the denominator, it's (c² |d| - v · d ). Let me factor out |d| in the denominator.

= |d| ( c² - (v · d̂ ) c² / |d| )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using different terms.

Wait, looking again at option C:

V = [ q c ] / [4 π ε0 (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) ]

Which is,

V = (q c ) / [4 π ε0 ( c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

But in our calculation, V is [ q c^2 ] / [4 π ε0 ( c^2 |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Hmm, so the denominator is the same, but the numerator in option C is q c, while our calculation has q c².

So perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is the same as (c |d| - v·d).

So,

V = [q/(4πε0)] * [1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ]

Which is,

= [ q/(4πε0 (1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ] * (1/|d| )

But as we established, [1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )] = (c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, substituting,

V = [ q/(4πε0) ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - d · v) ) ] * (1/|d| )

The |d| cancels:

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 (c² |d| - (d · v)) ]

Hmm, so V is ( q c^2 ) / denominator.

But in option C, V is ( q c ) / denominator.

So, this doesn't match. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait another approach: the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r,t) = ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [ 1 / ( 1 - (v · r̂ ) / c² ) ]

Where r̂ is the unit vector from the charge to the observation point at the retarded time.

So,

V(r,t) = ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v · (d/|d|) )/c² ) ) ]

= ( q / (4 π ε0 ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v · d )/(c² |d|) )) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by c² |d|:

= ( q c² ) / [4 π ε0 |d| ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which is,

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 ( |d| (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait: denominator is |d| multiplied by (c² |d| - (v · d) ), so,

= [ q c² ] / [4 π ε0 ( |d| (c^2 |d| - v · d) ) ]

Hmm, that's still not matching the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by:

A(r,t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Which, as before, is:

A(r,t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

So,

A = ( μ0 q v c² |d| ) / [4 π c² (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

The c² cancels:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| ) / [4 π (c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but in option C, A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π (d c - v · d ) )

So,

Compare with my expression:

A = [ μ0 q v |d| ] / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Hmm. The numerator in option C is μ0 q c v, and denominator is ( c |d| - (v · d) )

Wait, but in my expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - (v · d) )

So, unless the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which is different.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (c |d| - (v · d) ), but according to what I did earlier, it's (c² |d| - (v · d) )

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently.

Wait, another approach: the general expression for the scalar potential of a moving charge is:

V(r,t) = \dfrac{ q }{4\pi \epsilon_0 } \cdot \dfrac{1}{ |r - \vec{r}'(t_r)| } \cdot \dfrac{1}{1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v}(t_r) \cdot \hat{r}' }{c^2} }

Where r' is r - s(tr) = d.

So,

= ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² ) ) ]

Which is,

= q/(4 π ε0 ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² ) ) )

Let me write this as:

= q/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/( 1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= q/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So,

= q c² / [4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So V is [ q c² ] / denominator.

But in the options, option C's V is [ q c ] / denominator, which is missing a c in the numerator.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the expression for V.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d). Wait, if d is a vector, then d c is |d| c.

So, denominator in option C is ( |d| c - (d · v) )

So,

V = ( q c ) / ( 4 π ε0 ( |d| c - (d · v) ) )

But according to my calculation, it should be ( q c² ) / (denominator ). So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the expressions wrong. Let me think about the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by:

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Which, as before, is,

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Again, the c² cancels:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d) ) ]

But in option C, A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d) ) )

So the denominator is different, and the numerator has an extra c.

Hmm. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Lorentz gauge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a miscalculation, but I have to choose from them.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: V = qc/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), A = (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c -d·v))

Option D: V = qc/(4πε0 (d c +d·v)), A = (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c +d·v))

So, denominator in C is (c |d| - d·v ), and in D it's (c |d| +d·v )

Which one makes sense?

From the earlier expressions, the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which is not the same as any options, but perhaps the options are using a different notation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the expressions in the options.

Option B: V is (q)/(4π ε0 r), which is just the Coulomb potential, implying a static charge, so that's probably incorrect because the charge is moving.

Option A: V is same as B, and A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Option C and D have denominators involving (d c ± d · v ), which could be a form of (c |d| ± v·d )

So, considering that, perhaps the correct equations have denominators (c |d| - v·d ), which would be option C.

Alternatively, what's the denominator for the Liénard potentials.

Wait, according to Liénard's expressions, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) [ 1/( r_t ) ] [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Where r_t is the distance at the retarded time.

Wait, but r_t is |r - s(tr)|.

So,

V = (q)/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which is,

= q/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, V = q c² / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

Hmm, but none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector potential. Let me recall that the vector potential A is (μ0/(4π c²)) times the velocity times the same denominator term.

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which gives,

= (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Simplify,

= (μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

Again, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking at option C:

V(r,t) = qc/(4 π ε0 (d c - d · v) )

Which is,

V = (q c )/(4 π ε0 ( c |d| - (d · v) ) )

Compare to our expression: V = ( q c² ) / [ 4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, the denominator is similar, but the numerator in option C has only a single c, while according to our calculation, it has c squared.

So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere, but I can't spot where.

Alternatively, perhaps the expressions in the options are using a different form, like expressing the denominator as (c d - d · v ), where d is |d|.

So, denominator becomes (c |d| - (d · v) )

Hmm. Let me check the units to see which option makes sense.

V has units of volts, which is joules per coulomb (J/C). But since it's an electric potential, V = (1/(4πε0)) (q / r) in the static case, so the units check out.

Looking at option C:

V = (q c ) / (4 π ε0 (c |d| - d·v) )

The denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which has units of (m/s * m) - (m/s * m/s * m) = m²/s - m^3/s^2 → Not sure, but perhaps it should have units of meters. Let's compute the denominator's units:

c has units m/s, |d| is m, so c|d| is m^2/s. d·v is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator has (m²/s - m²/s) → dimensionless? No, no, that can't be. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, c|d| is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. d·v is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s - m²/s ), which is zero? That can't be right. So that suggests that option C's denominator has the same units as m²/s, which in the denominator would make V's units (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) → (C) / (m ), which is correct for electric potential (V = J/C, J= N m → V= (N m)/C = (kg m^2/s² ) m / C → kg m^2/(s² C), but Coulomb is (A s ), so kg m^2/(s^3 A ) → which is Volts. So units do check out.

Wait, but the denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which is m²/s. So the denominator in V is m²/s. So the numerator is q c, which is Coulomb * (m/s). So,

[ (C)(m/s) ) ] / [ (m²/s) ) ] → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C/(m ), which is Volts. Correct.

Similarly for A:

Option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d·v) )

μ0 has units H/m (henrys per meter), which is (kg m/(s² A² )).

So,

μ0 q c v: [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * [ C ] * [ m/s ] * [ m/s ].

But C is equal to A s, so:

= [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * [ A s ] * (m/s) * (m/s )

= [ kg m/(s² A² ) ] * A s * m²/s²

= kg m^3/(s^3 A )

Denominator is [ (m²/s) ) ]

So,

A = [ kg m^3/(s^3 A ) ] / [ m²/s ) ] = [ kg m^3/(s^3 A ) ] * [ s/m² ]

= kg m/(s^2 A )

But the unit of A is Tesla·m² (since B = ∇ × A, and B in Tesla is kg/(s² A ) ).

Hmm, let me compute the units again.

Wait, the unit of A is T·m²? No, the unit of vector potential A is Tesla multiplied by meter squared? Or not. Let me think. Tesla is kg/(s² A). So, if A has units of (kg m)/(s² A ), that's Tesla multiplied by m.

Wait, but the vector potential's unit is indeed kg m/(s² A ), which equals (kg·m/s² )·s²/(A·m ) ) → which is (N·s² )/(A·m ) → Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost.

But regardless, the units for option C's A seem to work out.

So, perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, the denominator in the vector potential for option C is (c |d| - d·v ), which, from our earlier calculation, that's different from the denominator we have (c² |d| - d·v ), but if the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v) ), and in our calculation, denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), then none of the options would match, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me go back to the standard expressions.

Wait, I think I remember that the potentials can be written using the terms (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So,

V(r, t) = ( q/(4 π ε0 ) ) * ( 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² ) ) )

Which,

= ( q/(4 π ε0 ) ) * ( c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - d · v )

So,

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Similarly, A is:

A = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * ( c² |d| ) / ( c² |d| - d · v )

Which,

= (μ0 q v |d| ) / (4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm. So none of the options have this form, but option C has:

V = ( q c ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which would require that the denominator in our expression is (c |d| - d · v ), but according to our calculation, it's ( c² |d| - d · v )

Unless I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should go back to the thought process.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, the term is (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that would imply that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), so the correct option would have this denominator.

Looking back, in option C, denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and in option D, it's (c |d| + d · v )

Wait, but from the earlier expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), which is different.

So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but since I have to choose from the given options, I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) )

Let me reevaluate the expression for V.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, it's (c |d| - (d · v) ) but multiplied by something else.

Wait, let's consider the case where the charge is moving directly towards the observation point. So, d and v are in the same direction. So, d · v = |d| v.

So, the denominator would be (c |d| - |d| v ) = |d| (c - v )

In that case, V would be:

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Hmm. If that's the case, but if in the options, the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which in this case is |d| (c - v ), then V becomes ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( |d| (c - v ) ) ), which is ( q c² )/( 4 π ε0 |d| (c-v) )

But none of the options have c squared in the numerator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is (c |d| - d · v )

But according to that, in our case when d and v are in the same direction, denominator is |d| (c - v ), so V would be (q c² )/(4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Which is the same as ( q c² )/(4 π ε0 |d| (c - v ) )

Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formulation. Let me look for an alternative approach.

Another way: in the context of retarded potentials, the fields are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, such that the emitted fields travel at speed c to reach the observation point r at time t.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = ( q )/(4 π ε0 ) * [ 1/( r' ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r.

Again, r' is |d|.

So,

V = ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ]

= ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

So, this is the same as before.

But the options don't have this expression.

Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of d as a vector with magnitude, but expressed differently.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - d · v ), which is ( |d| c - d · v ).

But according to our expression, the denominator is ( c² |d| - d · v )

So, unless option C's denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which would not match our calculation, but let's check.

So, if the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), then our expression would be:

V = ( q c² ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

But in option C, V is ( q c ) / (4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) )

So, our expression has an extra c in the numerator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for V. Let me think again.

Another approach: let's assume that the denominator in the options is correct, and see which option makes sense.

Option C:

V = ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε0 ( c |d| - d · v ) ]

A = ( μ0 q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) ]

So, for units, V is volts, which should be (J/C ), which is (N·m)/C.

Option C's V: numerator is q c → C * (m/s )

Denominator is ( m/s * m ) - ( m²/s ) → m²/s - m²/s → zero? No, can't be.

Wait, no, the denominator in V is ( c |d| - (d ⋅ v) ), which is (m/s * m ) - (m * m/s ) → both terms are m²/s.

So denominator units are m²/s.

So, V's units are (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) ) → (C * m/s ) * s/(m² ) → C/( m ), which is correct for volts (V = J/C, and J = N m = kg m²/s² → V = kg m²/(s² C) )

But with option C's denominator, the denominator has units of m²/s, so the numerator (q c ) has units (C)(m/s ), so overall units (C m/s )/( m² /s ) ) → C/(m ), which is correct.

Similarly, for A, the numerator is μ0 q c v → (H/m ) * C * (m/s ) * (m/s ) → H is kg m/(s² A² ), so:

( kg m/(s² A² ) ) * C * m/s * m/s → kg m/(s² A² ) * C * m²/s² → kg m^3/(s^4 A² )

Denominator is ( m²/s )

So, A has units kg m^3/(s^4 A² ) / ( m²/s ) → kg m/(s^3 A² )

Wait, but the unit of vector potential A is T·m, since B is measured in Tesla (kg/(s² A ) ), and B = ∇×A → so A must have units (kg·m)/(s² A )

Wait, my calculation gives kg m/(s^3 A² ), which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct despite the earlier confusion.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the expressions of V and A.

In option C, V is proportional to c, and A is proportional to c v.

In our earlier calculation, V is proportional to c², and A is proportional to v |d|.

So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about a specific case. For example, if the charge is stationary, then v is zero.

In that case, the denominator becomes c |d|.

So,

V should be ( q )/(4 π ε0 |d| ), which is correct for a static charge.

Looking at the options:

- Option B: V is (q)/(4π ε0 r ), which is correct for a static charge, but the vector potential A is (v/c² ) V. But if v is zero, then A is zero, which is correct. So option B would be correct for a static charge.

But the question states that the charge is moving, so the potentials shouldn't be the same as static case.

Wait, but in option B, A would be zero because v is zero, which is correct for a static charge. But for a moving charge, option B's A is non-zero.

But the question is about a moving charge, so option B is probably incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, because when the charge isn't moving (v =0 ), then the denominator is c |d|, and V becomes ( q c )/(4 π ε0 c |d| ) → q/(4 π ε0 |d| ), which is correct. So, for static charge, option C gives correct V.

Similarly, A would be (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| ) ) → (μ0 q v )/(4 π c ), which for v=0 gives A=0, correct.

So, option C gives correct expressions when v=0.

But when v is not zero, does the denominator make sense?

Hmm, in our earlier derivation, the denominator is (c² |d| - d·v ), but option C's denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which would be different.

But when v is not zero, perhaps option C's denominator is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator derivation. Let me recheck.

In the denominator, 1 - (v · d̂ )/c² = [ c² |d| - (d · v) ] / (c² |d| )

So,

V = [ q/(4 π ε0) ] * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * (c² |d| ) / (c² |d| - d · v )

Which,

= [ q c² ] / (4 π ε0 (c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm. So, according to this, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), but none of the options have that.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is written as (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is option C, but the numerator in V is missing a c.

Wait, perhaps the expressions in the options are using a different scaling. For example, perhaps they have absorbed a factor of c into the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential's expression. The vector potential for a moving charge is:

A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

Which,

= ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

= ( μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

So, the vector potential's denominator is same as V's.

Looking at the options, option C's A is:

(μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which would mean that denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), which doesn't match our expression unless I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector potential. Let me think again.

Another approach: The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. The magnetic field due to a moving charge is given by Ampère's law, but considering relativistic effects.

The magnetic field B is (μ0 q v × r̂ ) / (4 π c² |r|² (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) )

But r is the position vector at the retarded time. So, r = d.

So,

B = (μ0 q (v × d̂ ) ) / (4 π c² |d|² (1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) )

The vector potential A is given by B = ∇ × A. For a point charge, A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ r̂ / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, according to the standard expression, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ] r̂

Which, in terms of d, is:

A = ( μ0 q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ] * (d/|d| )

So,

A = ( μ0 q v d )/(4 π c² ) * [ c² |d| / ( c² |d| - d · v ) ]

Simplify:

A = ( μ0 q v d )/(4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

But d is a vector, so d = |d| d̂.

So,

A = ( μ0 q v |d| d̂ )/(4 π ( c² |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm, which is similar to the expression in option C, except for the denominator.

Wait, option C's A is:

(μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Hmm, so the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and the numerator is (μ0 q c v )

In our expression, the denominator is (c² |d| - d · v ), and the numerator is (μ0 q v |d| )

So, to match option C, we'd need:

- The denominator to be (c |d| - d · v )

- The numerator to have an extra c and |d| missing.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), and then the vector potential would be:

A = ( μ0 q v |d| )/(4 π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which is different from option C.

But according to the options, option C's A is (μ0 q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| -d · v ) )

So, our expression for A would have |d| in the numerator and option C doesn't.

So, that's another discrepancy.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here, but based on the earlier analysis where option C gives correct static case and the denominator structure, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded time formalism in electromagnetism. The charge \( q \) moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The denominator in the potentials is expected to involve terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is the static Coulomb potential.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   This option assumes a static charge, which is inconsistent with the moving charge scenario. The vector potential does not match the expected form for a moving charge. **Incorrect**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), again representing a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   While the vector potential form is plausible for a moving charge, the scalar potential is static and does not account for the motion of the charge. **Incorrect**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) matches the expected structure for retarded potentials. The scalar and vector potentials are consistent with the motion of the charge, and the static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) reduces correctly to the Coulomb potential and zero vector potential. **Correct**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the expected form for retarded potentials, as it does not account for the relativistic correction properly. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded time formalism and the motion of the charge. The denominator \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) aligns with the expected structure, and the static case is recovered correctly.

**Answer: C**
