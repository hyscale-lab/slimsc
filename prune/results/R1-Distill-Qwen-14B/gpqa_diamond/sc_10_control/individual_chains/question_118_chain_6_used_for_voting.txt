Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again: the reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's think this through.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol. Oh right, enol means there's an adjacent double bond and an alcohol group. So the structure must be a cyclopentene ring with an -OH group somewhere. The numbering is 1, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is probably on C1 as well. But wait, no, enol has the double bond next to the hydroxyl group. So the structure should have the OH on C1 and the double bond between C1 and C2. Or maybe the OH is on C2 and the double bond is between C1 and C2? Wait, in cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond starts at C1, so the OH would be on C2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. Cyclopentene has five-membered ring with a double bond. Enol would have the OH adjacent to the double bond. So for 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2? Because in enol structure, the hydroxyl is on the carbon next to the double bond. So the structure would be a cyclopentene ring where C1 is double bonded to C2, and C2 has an -OH group. Also, the molecule has two methyl groups on C4. So the structure is cyclopent-1-en-2-ol with two methyl groups on C4, making it 4,4-dimethyl.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, the name is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So numbering starts such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. Because the suffix is 'enol', which implies the double bond is between the two carbons next to the OH. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. But wait, that can't be because in cyclopentene, the double bond is between two adjacent carbons. So perhaps the structure is cyclopentene with an OH on C2 and double bond between C1 and C2. No, that would make it cyclopent-1-en-2-ol. Which would be correct.

Wait, but the name is cyclopent-1-enol. So the enol is at position 1. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the -OH is on C2. Because in enol form, the OH is adjacent to the double bond. So for 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So that's the structure.

Now, when this reacts with bromine (Br2), what happens? Bromine adds across double bonds in a process called dibromination, typically via an anti addition (like in a dihalide). But wait, this molecule has an enol structure, which is a conjugated diene in a way, but more importantly, it's a conjugated enol, so when it reacts with bromine, it might undergo addition across the double bond. Alternatively, since it's an enol, maybe some kind of conjugate addition could happen. Wait, but in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So the structure is something like:

      O
      |
CH2-C=CH-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)2 ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it more accurately. The cyclopentene ring has five members. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. The hydroxyl is on position 2. And positions 4 and 4 (which is the same as position 5 and 4 perhaps) have methyl groups. Wait, no. Wait, 4,4-dimethyl would mean two methyl groups on the same carbon, which is C4. So the structure is:

Positions 1-2 (double bond), 2 has OH, and C4 has two methyl groups.

So when Br2 adds to the double bond, it would add across the double bond. Since the reaction is in an enol form, perhaps the addition is more likely to be conjugate, but wait, in this case, the double bond is isolated. So bromine would add across the double bond via an anti addition, perhaps leading to a vicinal dihalide.

But wait, the enol form might undergo some other reaction. Enols are acidic and can tautomerize to ketones. Oh, right! So maybe before the reaction with Br2, the enol could tautomerize to a ketone. So the enol is in equilibrium with a ketone, which is the keto form. So perhaps the reaction is taking place on the enol, but maybe the major product comes from the keto form.

Alternatively, the reaction could be adding bromine to the double bond of the enol. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So that's an enol, which can tautomerize to cyclopentanone derivative. Let me think about the keto form. The keto form would have a ketone group. So, where would that be?

In the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. When it tautomerizes, the double bond moves to between C2 and C3, and the ketone (C=O) forms on C3. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: in the enol, the structure is C1=C2-OH, connected in a ring. The keto form would have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the enol is at position 1, so the keto form is at position 2. Hmm, maybe I should think about the tautomerization.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with bromine would proceed via the enol's double bond. So Br2 would add across the double bond in a dibromination.

But wait, when Br2 adds to a cyclopropane ring or a cyclopentene, the addition would be via the bromonium ion intermediate, leading to anti addition. So the product would have Br added to C1 and C2 in a trans configuration.

Wait, but in a ring like cyclopentene, the addition of bromine would form a dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclopentane or something similar, but with the substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl. So after adding Br to C1 and C2, the substituents would be on C1 and C2. Then the molecule would have Br on C1 and C2, and methyl groups on C4.

But the options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that's a cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2, and two methyl on C4.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. A cyclopentanone with Br on C2 and two methyl on C4.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Br on C4, which already has two methyl, so three substituents?

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So same as A but with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but if the reaction adds Br to the double bond, the product would be a di-substituted dibromide. But in the options, the products are either diols or ketones with Br. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, and then the bromine adds elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo a conjugate addition of bromine. Wait, but bromine typically doesn't do 1,4 additions; that's more for things like Michael additions with other reagents. Alternatively, maybe the enol can react with bromine via some other pathway.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: in some cases, enols can undergo bromination at the alpha position. But wait, that usually involves HBr addition or something else. Or maybe the dienol can undergo bromine addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromohydrination. Wait, no, that's when water and HBr add across the double bond, but here it's just bromine.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The starting material is an enol, which can react with bromine in a Diels-Alder type reaction? No, that's for dienes and dienophiles. Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple dihalide addition.

Wait, but in an enol, the hydroxyl is adjacent to a double bond. So when Br2 is added, does it add across the double bond, making a dibromide, or does it substitute the hydroxyl group?

Wait, substitution of the hydroxyl group with Br would require a good leaving group. But in the enol, the hydroxyl is not a great leaving group. So more likely, the Br would add to the double bond.

So, the reaction would be an addition of Br2 across the double bond of the enol, forming a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with the OH group still present.

Wait, but looking at the options, the products have either two Br atoms (A and D) or one Br (B and C). So if the Br adds to the double bond, the product would have two Brs, making options A or D possible.

But wait, the starting material is an enol. If we add Br across the double bond, we would get a di-substituted dibromide. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH group on C2.

Wait, but in the starting material, the OH is on C2 and the double bond is C1-C2. So adding Br would make Br on C1 and C2. So the product would have Br on both, but what about the OH?

Wait, because the enol has an OH on C2, which is part of the conjugated system. So when adding Br2, would the addition occur on the same position where the OH is?

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 in a different way. Wait, maybe the OH group would deprotonate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic addition because of the conjugated system.

Wait, another angle: when enols react with halogens like Br2, sometimes a conjugate addition can occur. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive at the alpha position, leading to bromination at the alpha carbon.

Ah! Bromination at the alpha position. Wait, that makes sense. Because in an enol, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl (or the site where the carbonyl would form after tautomerization). So adding Br to an alpha carbon.

Wait, but the enol is in equilibrium with the keto form. So in the presence of Br2, perhaps the enol would react, but maybe the major product comes from the keto form.

Wait, but the starting material is the enol. So perhaps the reaction occurs on the enol. Alternatively, the enol could tautomerize to the keto form, and then bromine might add elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position, leading to a bromoketone. So, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then bromine adds to the alpha carbon.

But I'm not certain. Let me think: when an enol reacts with an electrophilic bromine, the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) is a target for electrophilic attack. So perhaps in this case, the enol would tautomerize to the ketone, which is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Then, the Br would add to the alpha position, which would be C2 or C5 or C3? Wait, in cyclopentanone, the carbonyl is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C5.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So when it tautomerizes, the keto form would have the carbonyl at C1. So the molecule becomes cyclopentanone with substituents. Where are the methyl groups?

In the enol, the methyl groups are on C4. So in the keto form (cyclopentanone), the substituents (two methyl) are on C4. So the structure would be cyclopentanone with two methyl groups on C4.

So the carbonyl is at C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. Adding Br to either of these would give a brominated ketone.

Wait, but how would the Br add? Let me think about the mechanism. In the keto form, the carbonyl is at C1, the alpha hydrogens are at C2 and C5. So when bromine reacts, it could abstract a hydrogen from the alpha position, leading to radical formation, but that's more for free radical bromination.

Alternatively, in an electrophilic addition, the carbonyl oxygen could activate the alpha positions for nucleophilic attack. But wait, bromine is a di-electrophile, so maybe it would add to the alpha position.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a conjugate addition. But I'm not recalling the exact mechanisms here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol form reacts with bromine directly. If the enol has a conjugated system, maybe the addition is similar to that of a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options B and C have a bromo group on C2 or C4, respectively, in a ketone structure. So options B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, and C:4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So if the reaction adds Br to the alpha position (C2 or C5 in the keto form), that would explain options B or another position.

Wait, but in the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So when the enol reacts with Br2, it would add Br across C1 and C2. But in that case, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH would remain on C2. Which would make one of the options A or D, which are diols with Br on C1 and C2.

But option B is a ketone with Br on C2. So perhaps after the addition of Br to the double bond, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, leading to a di-substituted bromide in the ketone form.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

If the enol adds Br2 across the double bond, making a vicinal dihalide (Br on C1 and C2), then the molecule would still have the OH on C2. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which matches options A and D. But the options B and C are ketones, which suggests that the OH was converted into a ketone.

But wait, in that case, would the addition of Br2 to the enol form cause the ring to open or something? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a structure that then tautomerizes.

Wait, another approach: the reaction between enols and Br2. Oh, wait! In some cases, when enols react with bromine, the addition can occur at the alpha position, leading to a brominated ketone. Because the enol form can lead to stabilization of the transition state via conjugation.

Ah, I think I remember something about that. Enols can undergo electrophilic addition, where the electrophile attacks the alpha carbon. So in the case of Br2, perhaps the Br adds to the alpha position of the enol, leading to a brominated product.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The enol has a conjugated system, which makes the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl group) more reactive towards electrophiles. So when Br2 is present, the enol can undergo bromination at the alpha position, leading to a bromoketone.

Wait, but the enol would have to tautomerize to the keto form first for that to happen. Because the alpha position is in the keto form. So perhaps the mechanism is: enol → keto, then Br adds to alpha position.

So in this case, the starting material is the enol. It tautomerizes to the ketone (cyclopentanone with two methyl groups on C4). Then, Br adds to the alpha position (C2 or C5) in the ketone. Since the methyl groups are on C4, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5, but in a cyclopentanone, all positions are adjacent, so there's symmetry.

So if the Br adds to C2, the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B). If it adds to C5, it's the same as C2 because of the ring's symmetry, so the product would still be option B.

Alternatively, would the Br add to the more substituted position? But in this case, both C2 and C5 are secondary carbons (since the ring is five-membered), so they're equally substituted.

Wait, but the starting enol has the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. When it tautomerizes to the ketone, the carbonyl is on C1, and the methyl groups are on C4. So the alpha positions are C2 and C5.

So when Br adds to C2, we get the product in option B. Thus, the major product is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but why wouldn't the Br add to the double bond? Because the enol's double bond is more reactive towards electrophilic addition compared to the alpha position? Or is the alpha bromination more favorable?

Hmm. Another thought: the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic attack at the alpha position because of conjugation. Since the enol is conjugated, the alpha position is more activated for electrophilic substitution. So perhaps the bromine adds to the alpha position via an electrophilic mechanism, leading to the ketone with Br on C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrination, but that would produce a diol and a Br, which isn't the case here.

So, putting it all together, the reaction likely leads to the bromination at the alpha position, forming a ketone with Br on C2. Which matches option B.

The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine (Br₂). The starting material is an enol, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2 in a cyclopentene ring. Additionally, there are two methyl groups on C4. When enols react with bromine, the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, in this case, C2 or C5) is highly reactive due to the conjugation between the hydroxyl group and the double bond. This makes the alpha position a preferred site for electrophilic attack.

The enol can tautomerize to the keto form, cyclopentanone, where the carbonyl group is at C1, and the two methyl groups remain on C4. In the keto form, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. Bromine adds to one of these alpha positions, leading to the formation of a brominated ketone. Due to the symmetry of the cyclopentanone ring, bromination at C2 or C5 results in the same product.

Thus, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, where bromine is added to the alpha position (C2) in the keto form.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **Option A:** (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol suggests dibromination at C1 and C2 with retention of the hydroxyl group. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism, as the enol likely tautomerizes to the keto form before bromination.
- **Option B:** 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone matches the expected product, where bromine is added to the alpha position (C2) of the keto form.
- **Option C:** 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone suggests bromination at C4, which is not the alpha position and is less likely due to the reactivity pattern of enols.
- **Option D:** (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol suggests dibromination at C1 and C2 with retention of the hydroxyl group. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism for the same reason as Option A.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as bromination occurs at the alpha position (C2) in the keto form.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again: the reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's think this through.

The numbering is 1, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is probably on C1 as well. But wait, no, enol has the double bond next to the hydroxyl group. So the structure should have the OH on C1 and the double bond between C1 and C2. Or maybe the OH is on C2 and the double bond is between C1 and C2? Wait, in cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond starts at C1, so the OH would be on C2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. Cyclopentene has five-membered ring with a double bond. Enol would have the OH adjacent to the double bond. So for 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2? Because in enol structure, the hydroxyl is on the carbon next to the double bond. So the structure would be a cyclopentene ring where C1 is double bonded to C2, and C2 has an -OH group. Also, the molecule has two methyl groups on C4. So the structure is cyclopent-1-en-2-ol with two methyl groups on C4, making it 4,4-dimethyl.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, the name is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So numbering starts such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. Because the suffix is 'enol', which implies the double bond is between the two carbons next to the OH. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. But wait, that can't be because in cyclopentene, the double bond is between two adjacent carbons. So perhaps the structure is cyclopentene with an OH on C2 and double bond between C1 and C2. No, that would make it cyclopent-1-en-2-ol. Which would be correct.

Wait, but the name is cyclopent-1-enol. So the enol is at position 1. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the -OH is on C2. Because in enol form, the OH is adjacent to the double bond. So for 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So that's the structure.

Now, when this reacts with bromine (Br2), what happens? Bromine adds across double bonds in a process called dibromination, typically via an anti addition (like in a dihalide). But wait, this molecule has an enol structure, which is a conjugated diene in a way, but more importantly, it's a conjugated enol, so when it reacts with bromine, it might undergo addition across the double bond. Alternatively, since it's an enol, maybe some kind of conjugate addition could happen. Wait, but in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So the structure is something like:

      O
      |
CH2-C=CH-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)2 ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it more accurately. The cyclopentene ring has five members. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. The hydroxyl is on position 2. And positions 4 and 4 (which is the same as position 5 and 4 perhaps) have methyl groups. Wait, no. Wait, 4,4-dimethyl would mean two methyl groups on the same carbon, which is C4. So the structure is:

Positions 1-2 (double bond), 2 has OH, and C4 has two methyl groups.

So when Br2 adds to the double bond, it would add across the double bond. Since the reaction is in an enol form, perhaps the addition is more likely to be conjugate, but wait, in this case, the double bond is isolated. So bromine would add across the double bond via an anti addition, perhaps leading to a vicinal dihalide.

But wait, the enol form might undergo some other reaction. Enols are acidic and can tautomerize to ketones. Oh, right! So maybe before the reaction with Br2, the enol could tautomerize to a ketone. So the enol is in equilibrium with a ketone, which is the keto form. So perhaps the reaction is taking place on the enol, but maybe the major product comes from the keto form.

Alternatively, the reaction could be adding bromine to the double bond of the enol. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So that's an enol, which can tautomerize to cyclopentanone derivative. Let me think about the keto form. The keto form would have a ketone group. So, where would that be?

In the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. When it tautomerizes, the double bond moves to between C2 and C3, and the ketone (C=O) forms on C3. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: in the enol, the structure is C1=C2-OH, connected in a ring. The keto form would have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the enol is at position 1, so the keto form is at position 2. Hmm, maybe I should think about the tautomerization.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with bromine would proceed via the enol's double bond. So Br2 would add across the double bond in a dibromination.

But wait, when Br2 adds to a cyclopropane ring or a cyclopentene, the addition would be via the bromonium ion intermediate, leading to anti addition. So the product would have Br added to C1 and C2 in a trans configuration.

Wait, but in a ring like cyclopentene, the addition of bromine would form a dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclopentane or something similar, but with the substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl. So after adding Br to C1 and C2, the substituents would be on C1 and C2. Then the molecule would have Br on C1 and C2, and methyl groups on C4.

But the options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that's a cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2, and two methyl on C4.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. A cyclopentanone with Br on C2 and two methyl on C4.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Br on C4, which already has two methyl, so three substituents?

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So same as A but with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but if the reaction adds Br to the double bond, the product would be a di-substituted dibromide. But in the options, the products are either diols or ketones with Br. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, and then the bromine adds elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol form reacts with bromine directly. If the enol has a conjugated system, maybe the addition is similar to that of a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options B and C have a bromo group on C2 or C4, respectively, in a ketone structure. So options B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, and C:4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So if the reaction adds Br to the alpha position (C2 or C5 in the keto form), that would explain options B or another position.

Wait, but in the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So when the enol reacts with Br2, it would add Br across C1 and C2. But in that case, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH would remain on C2. Which would make one of the options A or D, which are diols with Br on C1 and C2.

But option B is a ketone with Br on C2. So perhaps after the addition of Br to the double bond, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, leading to a di-substituted bromide in the ketone form.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

If the enol adds Br2 across the double bond, making a vicinal dihalide (Br on C1 and C2), then the molecule would still have the OH on C2. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which matches options A and D. But the options B and C are ketones, which suggests that the OH was converted into a ketone.

But wait, in that case, would the addition of Br2 to the enol form cause the ring to open or something? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a structure that then tautomerizes.

Wait, another approach: the reaction between enols and Br2. Oh, wait! In some cases, when enols react with bromine, the addition can occur at the alpha position, leading to a brominated ketone. Because the enol form can lead to stabilization of the transition state via conjugation.

Ah, I think I remember something about that. Enols can undergo electrophilic addition, where the electrophile attacks the alpha carbon. So in the case of Br2, perhaps the Br adds to the alpha position of the enol, leading to a brominated product.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The enol has a conjugated system, which makes the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl group) more reactive towards electrophiles. So when Br2 is present, the enol can undergo bromination at the alpha position, leading to a bromoketone.

Wait, but the enol would have to tautomerize to the keto form first for that to happen. Because the alpha position is in the keto form. So perhaps the mechanism is: enol → keto, then Br adds to alpha position.

So in this case, the starting material is the enol. It tautomerizes to the ketone (cyclopentanone with two methyl groups on C4). Then, Br adds to the alpha position (C2 or C5) in the ketone. Since the methyl groups are on C4, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5, but in a cyclopentanone, all positions are adjacent, so there's symmetry.

So if the Br adds to C2, the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B). If it adds to C5, it's the same as C2 because of the ring's symmetry, so the product would still be option B.

Alternatively, would the Br add to the more substituted position? But in this case, both C2 and C5 are secondary carbons (since the ring is five-membered), so they're equally substituted.

Wait, but the starting enol has the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. When it tautomerizes to the ketone, the carbonyl is on C1, and the methyl groups are on C4. So the alpha positions are C2 and C5.

So when Br adds to C2, we get the product in option B. Thus, the major product is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but why wouldn't the Br add to the double bond? Because the enol's double bond is more reactive towards electrophilic addition compared to the alpha position? Or is the alpha bromination more favorable?

Hmm. Another thought: the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic attack at the alpha position because of conjugation. Since the enol is conjugated, the alpha position is more activated for electrophilic substitution. So perhaps the bromine adds to the alpha position via an electrophilic mechanism, leading to the ketone with Br on C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrination, but that would produce a diol and a Br, which isn't the case here.

So, putting it all together, the reaction likely leads to the bromination at the alpha position, forming a ketone with Br on C2. Which matches option B.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine (Br₂). The starting material is an enol, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2 in a cyclopentene ring. Additionally, there are two methyl groups on C4. When enols react with bromine, the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, in this case, C2 or C5) is highly reactive due to the conjugation between the hydroxyl group and the double bond. This makes the alpha position a preferred site for electrophilic attack.

The enol can tautomerize to the keto form, cyclopentanone, where the carbonyl group is at C1, and the two methyl groups remain on C4. In the keto form, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. Bromine adds to one of these alpha positions, leading to the formation of a brominated ketone. Due to the symmetry of the cyclopentanone ring, bromination at C2 or C5 results in the same product.

Thus, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, where bromine is added to the alpha position (C2) in the keto form.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **Option A:** (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol suggests dibromination at C1 and C2 with retention of the hydroxyl group. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism, as the enol likely tautomerizes to the keto form before bromination.
- **Option B:** 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone matches the expected product, where bromine is added to the alpha position (C2) of the keto form.
- **Option C:** 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone suggests bromination at C4, which is not the alpha position and is less likely due to the reactivity pattern of enols.
- **Option D:** (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol suggests dibromination at C1 and C2 with retention of the hydroxyl group. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism for the same reason as Option A.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as bromination occurs at the alpha position (C2) in the keto form.

**Answer: B**
