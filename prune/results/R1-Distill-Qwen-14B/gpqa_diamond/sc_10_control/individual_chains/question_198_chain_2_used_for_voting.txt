Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I think I remember stability constants from my studies. They are used to determine the stability of complexes in solution. So, the higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The given data includes the total cobalt concentration, the concentration of thiocyanate ions, and a series of stability constants for different complexes.

First, I need to understand the possible complexes here. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The stability constants (β) given are for complexes [Co(SCN)]^n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, but usually, the order of β values indicates the stability of the complexes. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β1, and β4 is lower than β3 but higher than β1? Or maybe I misread the order. Let me check: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, so β3 is the highest, then β2, then β4, and β1 is the lowest.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the formula right. The stability constant β for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} would be given by βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] ] / [Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n. Each βn corresponds to the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

The problem asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's the β2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find out the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the β2 complex.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one. So, our target is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But this total includes all possible cobalt species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. So the sum of all these concentrations is 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration. So, the solution is SCN- rich. That would mean that most of the Co^2+ would form complexes, especially the more stable ones with higher β.

But wait, the stability constants determine which complexes form more. The order of β is β3 > β2 > β4 > β1. So the most stable is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), then [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16), and the least is [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9).

Wait, but wait, I might have this backwards. Because sometimes the stability constants decrease with the number of ligands, but in this case, β3 is the highest. Hmm, but let's proceed.

So, the formation of the various complexes depends on their stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The general approach to find the fractions is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

But in practice, when dealing with multiple stability constants, the distribution of species can be found using the stepwise formation constants. Alternatively, we can use the overall stability constants and set up equations to find the fractions.

Let me think about the possible species:

Co^2+ can form:

1. [Co]^2+ → free ion
2. [CoSCN]^+ → n=1, β1=9
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → n=2, β2=40
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- → n=3, β3=63
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → n=4, β4=16

Wait, but wait, for each species, the stability constant is the cumulative product up to that point, right? Or are these stepwise constants? Hmm, I think each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands, not stepwise. So, for example, β1 is K1, β2 is K1*K2, β3 is K1*K2*K3, etc. Wait, no, perhaps not. Actually, I think that these β values are the overall constants for each complex. That is, each βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} from Co^2+ and n SCN-.

So, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9), the second is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), the third is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), and so on.

Wait, no, actually, the way the problem states the stability constants, each βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, with K = βn.

Wait no, that can't be right because each βn would then be the overall constant, not stepwise. Alternatively, if βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand, then βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] [SCN^-] )

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem states they are the stability constants, so I think each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

But wait, that would mean that the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would require considering both β1 and β2.

Alternatively, perhaps the βn are the stepwise formation constants, where each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN- to [Co(SCN)_{n-1}], forming [Co(SCN)_n}.

So, the total stability for [Co(SCN)_n} would be the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

Wait, but in that case, the given βs would be the stepwise constants, and the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n} would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But the way the problem is stated, the β1, β2, etc., are the stability constants for each complex, so that would mean that each βn is the equilibrium for Co^2+ + n SCN^- <-> [complex]. So, for each [Co(SCN)_n], the βn is the overall formation constant.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify this. Let's define the formation of each complex:

[Co(SCN)_1]^+ : Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

[Co(SCN)_2]^0: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2}^0 ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] )

Similarly, β3 would be the constant for [Co(SCN)_3}^- : [Co(SCN)_2}^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3}^-, β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3}^- ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2}^0 [SCN^-] )

And β4 would be for [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}: [Co(SCN)_3}^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3}^- [SCN^-] )

If that's the case, then the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n} is the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

So, the overall β for [CoSCN]^+ is β1.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall β is β1 * β2.

For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, it's β1 * β2 * β3.

For [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

But I'm not sure; perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each βn is the stepwise constant. Because, otherwise, the given β3=63 would be the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_3}^-, which would be a very high value, suggesting it's very stable.

But given that β4=16, which is lower than β3, this could mean that the fourth ligand is less likely to bind, but perhaps because the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} would be 63 * 16 = 1008, which is higher than the other complexes.

Wait, perhaps the given βs are the overall constants. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40. For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, β3=63. For [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, β4=16.

Wait, but 16 is lower than 63, which would suggest that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. But that doesn’t make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the βs are stepwise.

I think the confusion arises because the problem doesn't specify whether the βs are stepwise or overall. But I think in most cases, stability constants are given as overall, but sometimes as stepwise. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the stepwise βn is the constant for the nth ligand, and the overall β for each complex is the product up to n. Let's try that approach.

So, for each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ → β1 =9 (stepwise)

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40 (stepwise, adding the second ligand)

[Co(SCN)_3}^- → β3=63 (third ligand)

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} → β4=16 (fourth ligand)

Then, the overall formation constants would be:

β_total_1 = β1 =9

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360

β_total_3 = β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680

β_total_4= β1 * β2 * β3 * β4=9*40*63*16=362880

Wait, but that would make the [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} the most stable, which is possible. Hmm, but in the problem, the given β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). But as a stepwise constant, β4 is for the fourth ligand. So perhaps each step after the third is less favorable, which would complicate the distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βn are the overall formation constants for each [Co(SCN)_n} complex.

But regardless, I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2}^0 in the solution. So, perhaps I can model the formation of each complex using their respective βn.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the distribution of Co species using the given βs as the overall constants. Let me proceed under that assumption.

Let me denote the concentrations:

Let [Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = y

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = z

[Co(SCN)_3}^-= a

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} = b

The total cobalt concentration is x + y + z + a + b = 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M. But note that each complex consumes n SCN- ions. The total SCN- concentration is given, but the free [SCN^-] is not provided. Wait, but the total SCN- is 0.1 M, which includes the free SCN^- and that bound in the complexes.

Wait, the problem says the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the total SCN- is [SCN^-]_total = [SCN^-]_free + (sum over all complexes of n * [complex])

But this would complicate things because we have to account for the consumption of SCN- in the complexes.

Wait, but the problem is about a solution where the total Co is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the [SCN^-]_free is 0.1 M minus the amount bound in the complexes. But that's a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate by assuming that the majority of SCN- is still free (since 0.1 M is much higher than the total Co concentration of 0.01 M, which has 4 complexes, each consuming up to 4 SCN- per Co ion).

Wait, but 0.01 M Co, each Co can have up to 4 SCN-, so maximum SCN- consumed would be 0.04 M. But the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so free SCN- would be 0.06 M. That's a 60% decrease, which might not be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the free [SCN^-] can be approximated as 0.1 M, but that may not be accurate.

Hmm, this complicates the problem. Maybe another approach is needed. Let me think about the distribution of Co species.

Each complex is formed according to its stability constant. So, the fraction of each species can be determined by the relative stability constants and the concentrations.

But perhaps it's better to use the concept of the distribution ratio. The idea is that the fraction of each complex is proportional to its stability constant and the appropriate power of [SCN^-].

Wait, more accurately, the fraction of each complex is (βn * [SCN^-]^n ) divided by the sum of all (βi * [SCN^-]^i ) for i from 0 to 4 (where i is the number of SCN- per complex).

Wait, but wait. Let me formalize this. The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (βn * [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

Where n ranges from 0 to 4, but in our case, the complexes are [Co]^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3}^- (n=3), [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} (n=4).

But wait, [Co]^2+ is the n=0 case, but the β0 would be 1 (since it's the free ion). So, the fractions can be written as:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (β0 [SCN^-]^0 + β1 [SCN^-]^1 + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, the βn given in the problem are for each complex as the overall stability constant. So, the fraction of each complex would be:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

But wait, no. Because the overall βn for each complex includes all steps up to that point. So, for [Co]^2+, β0=1.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The fraction of each species is (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i ), where i ranges from 0 to 4.

Let me test this with an example. Suppose [SCN^-] is much higher than Co. Then, the higher n terms would dominate, and the fraction would be largest for the most stable complex with highest βn.

But in our case, we have:

β0 =1 (for Co^2+)

β1=9 ([CoSCN]^+)

β2=40 ([Co(SCN)_2]^0)

β3=63 ([Co(SCN)_3}^- )

β4=16 ([Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} )

Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. So, the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3}^- with β=63.

Wait, but the βs are provided, and each is the overall stability constant for each specific complex.

So, the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

So, with [SCN^-] =0.1 M, let's compute each term.

Compute [SCN^-]^n for n=0 to 4.

n=0: (0.1)^0 =1

n=1: 0.1

n=2:0.01

n=3:0.001

n=4:0.0001

Now, calculate each βn * [SCN^-]^n :

f0 = β0*(0.1)^0 =1*1=1

f1=9*0.1=0.9

f2=40*0.01=0.4

f3=63 *0.001=0.063

f4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these:

Σ =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646

Then, the fraction of each species is:

f0=1/2.3646 ≈0.4227 → 42.27%

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.3807 → 38.07%

f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%

f3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%

f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the n=2 case. So, the fraction f2 is approximately 16.9%, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, in my calculation, the sum of f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 is about 42.27 +38.07 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0676 ≈ 100%.

Wait, but wait, in the fractions, the [Co^2+] is 42.27%? That seems high when [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Because if [SCN^-] is high, you would expect more complexation.

But wait, the calculation was done under the assumption that each βn is the overall stability constant. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, considering each step's β.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the formation steps.

Let me think again: the distribution of Co species can be found by considering each possible complex and the equilibrium between them.

Alternatively, since the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, perhaps the majority of Co is complexed, but not all.

Let me think of the overall approach.

The solution contains Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. The possible complexes are [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3}^-, and [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}.

Each complex's concentration depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach is:

For each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But since the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, perhaps the overall concentrations can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+].

Let me define [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] =9x[SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN] =40 * (9x[SCN]) * [SCN] = 40 *9 x [SCN]^2 = 360x [SCN]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3}^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN] =63 * (360x [SCN]^2 ) * [SCN] =63 *360 x [SCN]^3 =22680 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3}^- * [SCN] =16 * (22680x [SCN]^3 ) * [SCN] =16 *22680 x [SCN]^4 =362880 x [SCN]^4

Now, the total Co concentration is:

x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2}^0 + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} =1e-2

Substituting each term in terms of x:

x + (9x [SCN]) + (360x [SCN]^2) + (22680x [SCN]^3) + (362880x [SCN]^4 ) =1e-2

We can factor x:

x [ 1 +9[SCN] +360[SCN]^2 +22680[SCN]^3 +362880 [SCN]^4 ] =1e-2

But [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Calculating each term inside the brackets:

1 is 1.

9*0.1=0.9

360*(0.1)^2 =360*0.01=3.6

22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

362880*(0.1)^4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288

Sum them:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the equation becomes:

x *64.468 =1e-2 → x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M

So, [Co^2+] ≈1.55e-4 M

Now, find each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN]^+ =9x[SCN] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=360x [SCN]^2 =360 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 =360 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^- =22680x [SCN]^3 =22680 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.55e-7=3.518e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=362880x [SCN]^4=362880 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4=362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.55e-8=5.614e-3 M

Now, check the sum:

x =1.55e-4 ≈0.000155

[CoSCN]^+=1.395e-4 ≈0.0001395

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=5.58e-4 ≈0.000558

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=3.518e-3 ≈0.003518

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=5.614e-3 ≈0.005614

Sum all these:

0.000155 + 0.0001395=0.0002945

+0.000558=0.0008525

+0.003518≈0.0043705

+0.005614≈0.010 (≈0.01 M), which matches the given total Co concentration. So, the calculations seem correct.

Now, the question is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2}^0, which is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt species is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (5.58e-4 /0.01)*100% =5.58%? But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because my calculation gives 5.58e-4 M for [Co(SCN)_2}^0, which is 5.58% of 0.01 M. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the approach. Because in the initial step, I considered each βn as the stepwise constant, but maybe they are the overall constants.

Wait, let me try that again.

If βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}, then:

[Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n} = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But in this case, the higher n complexes would have higher βn, so their concentrations would be higher.

Wait, but with β3=63 being the highest, so perhaps the majority of Co is in [Co(SCN)_3}^-.

Wait, let's proceed.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+=β1 x [SCN} =9 x [SCN}

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=β2 x [SCN}^2=40 x [SCN}^2

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=β3 x [SCN}^3=63 x [SCN}^3

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=β4 x [SCN}^4=16 x [SCN}^4

The total Co concentration is:

x +9x [SCN} +40x [SCN}^2 +63x [SCN}^3 +16x [SCN}^4 =1e-2

Factor x:

x [1 +9[SCN} +40[SCN}^2 +63[SCN}^3 +16[SCN}^4 ] =1e-2

Now, [SCN}=0.1, so calculate each term:

1 =1

9*0.1=0.9

40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646

So x *2.3646 =1e-2 → x =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.227e-3 M.

Wait, that's different from the previous approach. So, [Co^2+]≈4.227e-3 M.

Now, compute each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ =9 *4.227e-3 *0.1 =9 *4.227e-4=3.804e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=40 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.227e-3 *0.01=40 *4.227e-5=1.69e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=63 *4.227e-3 *(0.1)^3=63 *4.227e-3 *0.001=63 *4.227e-6=2.66e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=16 *4.227e-3 *(0.1)^4=16 *4.227e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.227e-7=6.763e-6 M

Now, check the sum:

x=4.227e-3 ≈0.004227

[CoSCN]^+ =3.804e-3 → 0.003804

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=1.69e-3 →0.00169

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=2.66e-4 →0.000266

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=6.763e-6 →0.000006763

Sum:

0.004227 +0.003804=0.008031 → +0.00169=0.009721 → +0.000266=0.009987 → +0.000006763≈0.0100 M, which matches.

Now, [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 1.69e-3 M.

The total Co is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (1.69e-3 / 0.01) *100% =16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but earlier with the stepwise approach, the percentage was 16.9% as well. Hmm, but in the stepwise approach, I had [Co(SCN)_2}^0 at 5.58e-4, which was 5.58% of the total. But in this approach, it's 16.9%. So which is correct?

Ah, the confusion arises from whether the given βn are stepwise or overall constants. It seems that the second approach, assuming βn are overall constants, gives an answer matching option D (16.9%).

Wait, but why is this approach giving a different result? Because in the first approach, each βn is a stepwise constant, leading to the fractions as per the earlier calculation, where [Co(SCN)_2}^0 was about 16.9% of the total. Wait, no, wait in the first approach, the fractions were:

f0=42.27% (free Co^2+)

f1=38.07% ([CoSCN}^+)

f2=16.9% ([Co(SCN)_2}^0)

Which would mean that [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 16.9% of the total Co.

But in the second approach, using the overall constants, [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 1.69e-3 M, which is 16.9% of the total 0.01 M.

So both methods give the same percentage for [Co(SCN)_2}^0.

Wait, but in the first approach, when I used the formula f_n = (βn [SCN}^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN}^i ), I calculated f2 as 16.9%.

In the second approach, using the overall constants, I get [Co(SCN)_2}^0 =16.9% of total Co.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and the total cobalt concentration.

### Key Information:
1. **Stability Constants**:  
   - β1 = 9 (for [CoSCN]^+)  
   - β2 = 40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^0)  
   - β3 = 63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^-)  
   - β4 = 16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-})  

2. **Concentrations**:  
   - Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M (0.01 M).  
   - Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.  

3. **Species Distribution**:  
   The cobalt species are:  
   - Free Co^2+  
   - [CoSCN]^+  
   - [Co(SCN)_2]^0  
   - [Co(SCN)_3]^-  
   - [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}  

   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Stability Constant Approach**:  
   The stability constant for each complex is given as the overall constant. Using the equilibrium expressions for each complex:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n.
   \]  
   Substituting the stability constants and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, the concentrations of all cobalt species can be expressed in terms of [\text{Co}^{2+}].

5. **Total Cobalt Equation**:  
   Substituting the expressions for each species into the total cobalt equation:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + 9[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1) + 40[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^2 + 63[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^3 + 16[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^4 = 0.01.
   \]  
   Factoring out [\text{Co}^{2+}]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left[ 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 \right] = 0.01.
   \]  
   Calculating the terms:  
   - \( 1 = 1 \)  
   - \( 9(0.1) = 0.9 \)  
   - \( 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4 \)  
   - \( 63(0.1)^3 = 63(0.001) = 0.063 \)  
   - \( 16(0.1)^4 = 16(0.0001) = 0.0016 \)  

   Summing these:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]  
   Solving for [\text{Co}^{2+}]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004227 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   Using the equilibrium expression for [Co(SCN)_2]^0:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 40[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 0.004227 M:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 40(0.004227)(0.01) = 0.000169 \, \text{M}.
   \]

7. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{\text{Total Co}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.000169}{0.01} \right) \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I think I remember stability constants from my studies. They are used to determine the stability of complexes in solution. So, the higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The given data includes the total cobalt concentration, the concentration of thiocyanate ions, and a series of stability constants for different complexes.

First, I need to understand the possible complexes here. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The stability constants (β) given are for complexes [Co(SCN)]^n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, but usually, the order of β values indicates the stability of the complexes. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β1, and β4 is lower than β3 but higher than β1? Or maybe I misread the order. Let me check: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, so β3 is the highest, then β2, then β4, and β1 is the lowest.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the formula right. The stability constant β for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} would be given by βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] ] / [Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n. Each βn corresponds to the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

The problem asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's the β2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find out the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the β2 complex.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one. So, our target is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But this total includes all possible cobalt species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. So the sum of all these concentrations is 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration. So, the solution is SCN- rich. That would mean that most of the Co^2+ would form complexes, especially the more stable ones with higher β.

But wait, the stability constants determine which complexes form more. The order of β is β3 > β2 > β4 > β1. So the most stable is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), then [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16), and the least is [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9).

Wait, but wait, I might have this backwards. Because sometimes the stability constants decrease with the number of ligands, but in this case, β3 is the highest. Hmm, but let's proceed.

So, the formation of the various complexes depends on their stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The general approach to find the fractions is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

But in practice, when dealing with multiple stability constants, the distribution of species can be found using the stepwise formation constants. Alternatively, we can use the overall stability constants and set up equations to find the fractions.

Let me think about the possible species:

Co^2+ can form:

1. [Co]^2+ → free ion
2. [CoSCN]^+ → n=1, β1=9
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → n=2, β2=40
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- → n=3, β3=63
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → n=4, β4=16

Wait, but wait, for each species, the stability constant is the cumulative product up to that point, right? Or are these stepwise constants? Hmm, I think each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands, not stepwise. So, for example, β1 is K1, β2 is K1*K2, β3 is K1*K2*K3, etc. Wait, no, perhaps not. Actually, I think that these β values are the overall constants for each complex. That is, each βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} from Co^2+ and n SCN-.

So, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9), the second is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), the third is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), and so on.

Wait, no, actually, the way the problem states the stability constants, each βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, with K = βn.

Wait no, that can't be right because each βn would then be the overall constant, not stepwise. Alternatively, if βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand, then βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] [SCN^-] )

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem states they are the stability constants, so I think each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

But wait, that would mean that the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would require considering both β1 and β2.

Alternatively, perhaps the βn are the stepwise formation constants, where each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN- to [Co(SCN)_{n-1}], forming [Co(SCN)_n}.

So, the total stability for [Co(SCN)_n} would be the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

Wait, but in that case, the given βs would be the stepwise constants, and the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n} would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But the way the problem is stated, the β1, β2, etc., are the stability constants for each complex, so that would mean that each βn is the equilibrium for Co^2+ + n SCN^- <-> [complex]. So, for each [Co(SCN)_n], the βn is the overall formation constant.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify this. Let's define the formation of each complex:

[Co(SCN)_1]^+ : Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

[Co(SCN)_2]^0: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2}^0 ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] )

Similarly, β3 would be the constant for [Co(SCN)_3}^- : [Co(SCN)_2}^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3}^-, β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3}^- ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2}^0 [SCN^-] )

And β4 would be for [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}: [Co(SCN)_3}^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3}^- [SCN^-] )

If that's the case, then the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n} is the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

So, the overall β for [CoSCN]^+ is β1.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall β is β1 * β2.

For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, it's β1 * β2 * β3.

For [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

But I'm not sure; perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each βn is the stepwise constant. Because, otherwise, the given β3=63 would be the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_3}^-, which would be a very high value, suggesting it's very stable.

But given that β4=16, which is lower than β3, this could mean that the fourth ligand is less likely to bind, but perhaps because the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} would be 63 * 16 = 1008, which is higher than the other complexes.

Wait, perhaps the given βs are the overall constants. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40. For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, β3=63. For [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}, β4=16.

Wait, but 16 is lower than 63, which would suggest that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. But that doesn’t make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the βs are stepwise.

I think the confusion arises because the problem doesn't specify whether the βs are stepwise or overall. But I think in most cases, stability constants are given as overall, but sometimes as stepwise. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the stepwise βn is the constant for the nth ligand, and the overall β for each complex is the product up to n. Let's try that approach.

So, for each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ → β1 =9 (stepwise)

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40 (stepwise, adding the second ligand)

[Co(SCN)_3}^- → β3=63 (third ligand)

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} → β4=16 (fourth ligand)

Then, the overall formation constants would be:

β_total_1 = β1 =9

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360

β_total_3 = β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680

β_total_4= β1 * β2 * β3 * β4=9*40*63*16=362880

Wait, but that would make the [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} the most stable, which is possible. Hmm, but in the problem, the given β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). But as a stepwise constant, β4 is for the fourth ligand. So perhaps each step after the third is less favorable, which would complicate the distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βn are the overall formation constants for each [Co(SCN)_n} complex.

But regardless, I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2}^0 in the solution. So, perhaps I can model the formation of each complex using their respective βn.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the distribution of Co species using the given βs as the overall constants. Let me proceed under that assumption.

Let me denote the concentrations:

Let [Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = y

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = z

[Co(SCN)_3}^-= a

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} = b

The total cobalt concentration is x + y + z + a + b = 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M. But note that each complex consumes n SCN- ions. The total SCN- concentration is given, but the free [SCN^-] is not provided. Wait, but the total SCN- is 0.1 M, which includes the free SCN^- and that bound in the complexes.

Wait, the problem says the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the total SCN- is [SCN^-]_total = [SCN^-]_free + (sum over all complexes of n * [complex])

But this would complicate things because we have to account for the consumption of SCN- in the complexes.

Wait, but the problem is about a solution where the total Co is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the [SCN^-]_free is 0.1 M minus the amount bound in the complexes. But that's a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate by assuming that the majority of SCN- is still free (since 0.1 M is much higher than the total Co concentration of 0.01 M, which has 4 complexes, each consuming up to 4 SCN- per Co ion).

Wait, but 0.01 M Co, each Co can have up to 4 SCN-, so maximum SCN- consumed would be 0.04 M. But the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so free SCN- would be 0.06 M. That's a 60% decrease, which might not be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the free [SCN^-] can be approximated as 0.1 M, but that may not be accurate.

Hmm, this complicates the problem. Maybe another approach is needed. Let me think about the distribution of Co species.

Each complex is formed according to its stability constant. So, the fraction of each species can be determined by the relative stability constants and the concentrations.

But perhaps it's better to use the concept of the distribution ratio. The idea is that the fraction of each complex is proportional to its stability constant and the appropriate power of [SCN^-].

Wait, more accurately, the fraction of each complex is (βn * [SCN^-]^n ) divided by the sum of all (βi * [SCN^-]^i ) for i from 0 to 4 (where i is the number of SCN- per complex).

Wait, but wait. Let me formalize this. The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (βn * [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

Where n ranges from 0 to 4, but in our case, the complexes are [Co]^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3}^- (n=3), [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} (n=4).

But wait, [Co]^2+ is the n=0 case, but the β0 would be 1 (since it's the free ion). So, the fractions can be written as:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (β0 [SCN^-]^0 + β1 [SCN^-]^1 + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, the βn given in the problem are for each complex as the overall stability constant. So, the fraction of each complex would be:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

But wait, no. Because the overall βn for each complex includes all steps up to that point. So, for [Co]^2+, β0=1.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The fraction of each species is (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i ), where i ranges from 0 to 4.

Let me test this with an example. Suppose [SCN^-] is much higher than Co. Then, the higher n terms would dominate, and the fraction would be largest for the most stable complex with highest βn.

But in our case, we have:

β0 =1 (for Co^2+)

β1=9 ([CoSCN]^+)

β2=40 ([Co(SCN)_2]^0)

β3=63 ([Co(SCN)_3}^- )

β4=16 ([Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} )

Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. So, the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3}^- with β=63.

Wait, but the βs are provided, and each is the overall stability constant for each specific complex.

So, the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN^-]^i )

So, with [SCN^-] =0.1 M, let's compute each term.

Compute [SCN^-]^n for n=0 to 4.

n=0: (0.1)^0 =1

n=1: 0.1

n=2:0.01

n=3:0.001

n=4:0.0001

Now, calculate each βn * [SCN^-]^n :

f0 = β0*(0.1)^0 =1*1=1

f1=9*0.1=0.9

f2=40*0.01=0.4

f3=63 *0.001=0.063

f4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these:

Σ =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646

Then, the fraction of each species is:

f0=1/2.3646 ≈0.4227 → 42.27%

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.3807 → 38.07%

f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%

f3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%

f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the n=2 case. So, the fraction f2 is approximately 16.9%, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, in my calculation, the sum of f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 is about 42.27 +38.07 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0676 ≈ 100%.

Wait, but wait, in the fractions, the [Co^2+] is 42.27%? That seems high when [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Because if [SCN^-] is high, you would expect more complexation.

But wait, the calculation was done under the assumption that each βn is the overall stability constant. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, considering each step's β.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the formation steps.

Let me think again: the distribution of Co species can be found by considering each possible complex and the equilibrium between them.

Alternatively, since the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, perhaps the majority of Co is complexed, but not all.

Let me think of the overall approach.

The solution contains Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. The possible complexes are [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3}^-, and [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}.

Each complex's concentration depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach is:

For each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But since the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, perhaps the overall concentrations can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+].

Let me define [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] =9x[SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN] =40 * (9x[SCN]) * [SCN] = 40 *9 x [SCN]^2 = 360x [SCN]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3}^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN] =63 * (360x [SCN]^2 ) * [SCN] =63 *360 x [SCN]^3 =22680 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3}^- * [SCN] =16 * (22680x [SCN]^3 ) * [SCN] =16 *22680 x [SCN]^4 =362880 x [SCN]^4

Now, the total Co concentration is:

x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2}^0 + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} =1e-2

Substituting each term in terms of x:

x + (9x [SCN]) + (360x [SCN]^2) + (22680x [SCN]^3) + (362880x [SCN]^4 ) =1e-2

We can factor x:

x [ 1 +9[SCN] +360[SCN]^2 +22680[SCN]^3 +362880 [SCN]^4 ] =1e-2

But [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Calculating each term inside the brackets:

1 is 1.

9*0.1=0.9

360*(0.1)^2 =360*0.01=3.6

22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

362880*(0.1)^4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288

Sum them:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the equation becomes:

x *64.468 =1e-2 → x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M

So, [Co^2+] ≈1.55e-4 M

Now, find each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN]^+ =9x[SCN] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=360x [SCN]^2 =360 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 =360 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^- =22680x [SCN]^3 =22680 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.55e-7=3.518e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=362880x [SCN]^4=362880 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4=362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.55e-8=5.614e-3 M

Now, check the sum:

x =1.55e-4 ≈0.000155

[CoSCN]^+=1.395e-4 ≈0.0001395

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=5.58e-4 ≈0.000558

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=3.518e-3 ≈0.003518

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=5.614e-3 ≈0.005614

Sum all these:

0.000155 + 0.0001395=0.0002945

+0.000558=0.0008525

+0.003518≈0.0043705

+0.005614≈0.010 (≈0.01 M), which matches the given total Co concentration. So, the calculations seem correct.

Now, the question is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2}^0, which is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt species is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (5.58e-4 /0.01)*100% =5.58%? But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because my calculation gives 5.58e-4 M for [Co(SCN)_2}^0, which is 5.58% of 0.01 M. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the approach. Because in the initial step, I considered each βn as the stepwise constant, but maybe they are the overall constants.

Wait, let me try that again.

If βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}, then:

[Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n} = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But in this case, the higher n complexes would have higher βn, so their concentrations would be higher.

Wait, but with β3=63 being the highest, so perhaps the majority of Co is in [Co(SCN)_3}^-.

Wait, let's proceed.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+=β1 x [SCN} =9 x [SCN}

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=β2 x [SCN}^2=40 x [SCN}^2

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=β3 x [SCN}^3=63 x [SCN}^3

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=β4 x [SCN}^4=16 x [SCN}^4

The total Co concentration is:

x +9x [SCN} +40x [SCN}^2 +63x [SCN}^3 +16x [SCN}^4 =1e-2

Factor x:

x [1 +9[SCN} +40[SCN}^2 +63[SCN}^3 +16[SCN}^4 ] =1e-2

Now, [SCN}=0.1, so calculate each term:

1 =1

9*0.1=0.9

40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646

So x *2.3646 =1e-2 → x =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.227e-3 M.

Wait, that's different from the previous approach. So, [Co^2+]≈4.227e-3 M.

Now, compute each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ =9 *4.227e-3 *0.1 =9 *4.227e-4=3.804e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=40 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.227e-3 *0.01=40 *4.227e-5=1.69e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=63 *4.227e-3 *(0.1)^3=63 *4.227e-3 *0.001=63 *4.227e-6=2.66e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=16 *4.227e-3 *(0.1)^4=16 *4.227e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.227e-7=6.763e-6 M

Now, check the sum:

x=4.227e-3 ≈0.004227

[CoSCN]^+ =3.804e-3 → 0.003804

[Co(SCN)_2}^0=1.69e-3 →0.00169

[Co(SCN)_3}^-=2.66e-4 →0.000266

[Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}=6.763e-6 →0.000006763

Sum:

0.004227 +0.003804=0.008031 → +0.00169=0.009721 → +0.000266=0.009987 → +0.000006763≈0.0100 M, which matches.

Now, [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 1.69e-3 M.

The total Co is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (1.69e-3 / 0.01) *100% =16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but earlier with the stepwise approach, the percentage was 16.9% as well. Hmm, but in the stepwise approach, I had [Co(SCN)_2}^0 at 5.58e-4, which was 5.58% of the total. But in this approach, it's 16.9%. So which is correct?

Ah, the confusion arises from whether the given βn are stepwise or overall constants. It seems that the second approach, assuming βn are overall constants, gives an answer matching option D (16.9%).

Wait, but why is this approach giving a different result? Because in the first approach, each βn is a stepwise constant, leading to the fractions as per the earlier calculation, where [Co(SCN)_2}^0 was about 16.9% of the total. Wait, no, wait in the first approach, the fractions were:

f0=42.27% (free Co^2+)

f1=38.07% ([CoSCN}^+)

f2=16.9% ([Co(SCN)_2}^0)

Which would mean that [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 16.9% of the total Co.

But in the second approach, using the overall constants, [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is 1.69e-3 M, which is 16.9% of the total 0.01 M.

So both methods give the same percentage for [Co(SCN)_2}^0.

Wait, but in the first approach, when I used the formula f_n = (βn [SCN}^n ) / Σ (βi [SCN}^i ), I calculated f2 as 16.9%.

In the second approach, using the overall constants, I get [Co(SCN)_2}^0 =16.9% of total Co.

So the correct answer is 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking back, the options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and the total cobalt concentration.

### Key Information:
1. **Stability Constants**:  
   - β1 = 9 (for [CoSCN]^+)  
   - β2 = 40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^0)  
   - β3 = 63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^-)  
   - β4 = 16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-})  

2. **Concentrations**:  
   - Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M (0.01 M).  
   - Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.  

3. **Species Distribution**:  
   The cobalt species are:  
   - Free Co^2+  
   - [CoSCN]^+  
   - [Co(SCN)_2]^0  
   - [Co(SCN)_3]^-  
   - [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}  

   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Stability Constant Approach**:  
   The stability constant for each complex is given as the overall constant. Using the equilibrium expressions for each complex:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n.
   \]  
   Substituting the stability constants and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, the concentrations of all cobalt species can be expressed in terms of [\text{Co}^{2+}].

5. **Total Cobalt Equation**:  
   Substituting the expressions for each species into the total cobalt equation:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + 9[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1) + 40[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^2 + 63[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^3 + 16[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^4 = 0.01.
   \]  
   Factoring out [\text{Co}^{2+}]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left[ 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 \right] = 0.01.
   \]  
   Calculating the terms:  
   - \( 1 = 1 \)  
   - \( 9(0.1) = 0.9 \)  
   - \( 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4 \)  
   - \( 63(0.1)^3 = 63(0.001) = 0.063 \)  
   - \( 16(0.1)^4 = 16(0.0001) = 0.0016 \)  

   Summing these:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]  
   Solving for [\text{Co}^{2+}]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004227 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   Using the equilibrium expression for [Co(SCN)_2]^0:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 40[\text{Co}^{2+}](0.1)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 0.004227 M:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 40(0.004227)(0.01) = 0.000169 \, \text{M}.
   \]

7. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{\text{Total Co}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.000169}{0.01} \right) \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species is **16.9%**.
