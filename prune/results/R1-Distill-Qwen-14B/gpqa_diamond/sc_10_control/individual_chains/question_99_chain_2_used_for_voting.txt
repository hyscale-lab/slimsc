Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of the unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The compound is an unknown, and we've used FTIR and 1H NMR to characterize it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, some complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, so what does the FTIR tell me? The broad peak around 3000 is likely due to O-H stretch, probably from a carboxylic acid group. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H bonds that absorb in that region and are usually broad. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably the C=O stretch, also typical of carboxylic acids. So the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now looking at the NMR. There are no vinyl hydrogens, which means no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the structure doesn't have any alkenes or similar groups. All the hydrogens are in more saturated environments, like single bonds.

In the NMR, we have a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated, but maybe it's due to splitting from neighboring groups. Let me think about how splitting works. Each peak is split by neighboring equivalent protons. So a doublet of triplets suggests that a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. For example, maybe adjacent to a CH₂ group and another CH group?

Wait, maybe looking at the structures provided in the options can help. Let me list the options again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, the first part of each option is a bit similar. Let's parse them:

Looking at the structures, each has a COOH group at the end. The structure before COOH is varying. Let me think about each option's structure.

Option A: The chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So that's like two substituents on each of the middle carbons. Specifically, each middle carbon (the two in the middle) has a methyl and an ethyl group attached. Wait, no. Let me see: the formula is CH3[C(H)(C2H5)]2CH2COOH? Or is it CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons (positions 2 and 3) has a methyl and ethyl group attached, and the next carbon is CH2 connected to COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the chain is CH2CH3 attached to a C(H)(C2H5), then another C(H)(C2H5), and then COOH. Wait, so maybe it's CH2CH2... No, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. The first part is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the first carbon is CH3CH2-, then a carbon attached to H and C2H5, then another same carbon, then COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (positions 2 and 3) have a methyl group and a hydrogen. The next carbon is CH2 and then COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the first part is CH3CH2, then a carbon with H and CH3, then another same carbon, then COOH.

Wait, so in each structure, the middle part is a geminal di-substitution? Or perhaps it's a structure where each of the middle carbons is attached to two substituents and a hydrogen.

Now, considering the NMR data. No vinyl hydrogens, which all options satisfy because there's no double bonds. The NMR has complex splitting, so maybe the structure has several sets of equivalent hydrogens that split each other.

In particular, the signals are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Let me think about how that could happen.

Looking at the splitting, a quartet would come from a neighboring group with three equivalent protons, like a CH3. A triplet would come from a neighboring group with two protons, like a CH2. So, perhaps a proton is split by two different adjacent groups.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (which would split into a triplet) and also next to another group with two protons (another triplet), that could result in a triplet of triplets. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, a certain proton is adjacent to two different groups. Let me think about each option.

Starting with option D: structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the middle two carbons each have a CH3 and a H. The structure would look like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH? Wait, no. Let me write it as:

CH2CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So each of the two middle carbons has a CH3 and a H. So each of these carbons has two substituents: a methyl and a hydrogen.

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2... No, let's think of the actual structure.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the four carbons before COOH are:

1: CH3CH2-

2: CH(CH3)

3: CH(CH3)

4: COOH.

Wait, but the structure would be CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the molecule is: 

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's CH2CH3 connected to a carbon that has H and CH3 (so CH(CH3)), then another carbon with H and CH3, and then COOH.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, wait. The first part is CH3CH2- (so ethyl group), connected to a CH that's attached to CH3, then another CH attached to CH3, then COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (2 and 3) has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group? No, wait. Wait, the substituents are attached to each CH.

In this structure, the middle two carbons are CH(CH3) groups, so each has a CH3 and a H. So the structure is:

Ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH(CH3), which is attached to COOH.

Now, looking at the NMR, the signals would come from different types of H.

The COOH group is at the end, so the H on the COOH would be a broad singlet, but the problem says none of the NMR peaks are vinyl, which we already accounted for. So the protons we are seeing are on the other carbons.

In option D, which is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups have a H and a CH3. Are these equivalent? Let's see. The two CH groups are in the middle. Are they equivalent through symmetry? If the molecule is symmetrical, then perhaps the two CH groups are equivalent.

Wait, the structure would be something like:

   CH2CH3
    |
CH3-C - C - COOH
    |     |
    H     H
    |
    CH3  CH3

Wait, no. Each of the two middle carbons is CH(CH3). So, each has a CH3 and a CH2CH3? No, wait. No, the structure is CH3CH2 attached to the first CH group.

Let me think about the symmetry. The two middle carbons are both CH(CH3) and connected to each other. So the molecule is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Is there any symmetry? The two CH(CH3) groups are connected to each other, so perhaps they are equivalent.

In that case, the H on each CH(CH3) would be equivalent. So the H on the first CH(CH3) (attached to the ethyl group) and the H on the second CH(CH3) (attached to the COOH) would be different because their environments are different. Because the first is next to ethyl, the second next to COOH.

Hmm, but perhaps not. Let me visualize the structure. The molecule is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the first CH is connected to ethyl, and the second CH is connected to COOH.

So the two CH groups are not equivalent because their substituents are different on each side. So the H on the first CH would be split by neighboring groups, and the H on the second CH would also be split.

Wait, let's see how each H would appear in the NMR.

The first CH, attached to the ethyl group, is adjacent to which other groups? It's connected to the ethyl (CH2CH3), and its neighboring CH (which is the second CH group). So the H on the first CH is adjacent to the second CH group. The second CH group's H is adjacent to both the first CH and the COOH group.

Wait, but the COOH is a carbonyl group. So the H on the second CH is adjacent to another CH group and to the COOH's CH2 (if any). Wait, the COOH is directly attached to the second CH, so the H on the second CH is adjacent to the COOH group.

Hold on, perhaps a better approach is to look for the splitting patterns in each option.

Looking at the NMR data: two complex splitting patterns. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, a quartet would be from a neighboring group with 3 equivalent protons, like CH3. A triplet is from a neighboring group with 2 equivalent protons, like CH2.

So, imagine a proton that is next to a CH2 group and a CH3 group. Then, each of these would cause splitting.

Let me think about each option's structure and see which one would produce such splitting.

Option D's structure: CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The first CH(CH3) (let's call this CH1) is attached to CH2CH3 and to CH2 (the next CH(CH3) group, CH2).

Wait, no. The structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So CH1 is CH(CH3) attached to CH2CH3 and to CH2 (the CH(CH3) group). Similarly, CH2 is CH(CH3) attached to CH1 and to COOH.

Each CH group has a H and a CH3.

So the H on CH1 is adjacent to CH2. CH2's H is adjacent to CH1 and the COOH.

Wait, but how does this affect splitting? Hmm.

Each H on CH1 would be split by the H on CH2. Let's think: the H on CH1 is adjacent to the H on CH2. So, if CH2 has one H, then the splitting would be a doublet. But wait, if there are two H's on CH2? Wait, no. Each CH group has only one H.

Wait, no. Each of the CH groups in option D has only one H. So each H on CH1 is next to the H on CH2.

So, for the H on CH1, the adjacent H is on CH2. So each would split into a doublet. But that's just a simple doublet.

Wait, maybe more complex. Let me think about vicinal coupling. The H on CH1 is adjacent to the H on CH2. So, each would be a doublet. So each would be split into a doublet due to the other.

But that would only give a doublet for each H. But the NMR data shows more complex splitting, like doublet of triplets, etc. So perhaps that's not where the complexity is coming from.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would cause splitting. The H on ethyl are split by adjacent H's.

Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3. The CH2 would be next to the CH group (CH1). So the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on CH1.

Wait, perhaps that's a possibility.

Let me consider the ethyl group. The CH2 in ethyl (CH2CH3) is attached to the CH1 group. So the H's on the ethyl CH2 would each be adjacent to the H on CH1.

So the ethyl CH2 would be a triplet because each H on CH2 is adjacent to CH1's H (which is a single H, so splitting into a doublet, but wait, no. The splitting depends on the number of neighboring H's.

Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to the CH1. So the CH2 is adjacent to CH1's H. Each H on the CH2 is next to the H on CH1. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the H on CH1. Since the CH2 has two H's, each of their environments would be influenced by the H on CH1.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the CH2 is split by the H on CH1. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet because of the single H on CH1. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, the splitting would result in a triplet for the CH2. Because the coupling is between two sets: each of the two H's on CH2 would be split by the H on CH1, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The ethyl CH2 is attached to CH1, which has one H. The H's on the ethyl CH2 are adjacent to the H on CH1. So each H on the ethyl CH2 would couple with the single H on CH1. So each H on ethyl CH2 would have a doublet. But since they are two equivalent H's on the same CH2, the splitting would be a triplet for the CH2 group.

Wait, no, wait. The ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to a CH that has one H. So the two H's on CH2 are each split by that single H into a doublet. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, their combined peak would be a triplet for the ethyl CH2 group.

So the ethyl CH2 would appear as a triplet. But in the NMR data, we have a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps the complex splitting comes from another part of the molecule.

Wait, maybe the splitting is due to multiple neighboring groups. Let me think about option A.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Wait, the structure is CH3 attached to a C(H)(C2H5), then another C(H)(C2H5), then CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the first carbon is CH3 attached to a CH group (C(H)(C2H5)), which is connected to another similar CH group, then a CH2, then COOH.

Each of the two CH groups (positions 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl (C2H5) group.

So, the two CH groups are each attached to ethyl and H.

So, each CH (position 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl group.

Now, considering the symmetry: if the two CH groups are identical in environment, then their H's would be equivalent. So perhaps the H on CH2 and CH3 are the same, leading to a singlet? But that might not be the case.

Wait, position 2: CH attached to CH3 and C2H5.

Position 3: CH attached to C2H5 and CH2COOH.

Wait, no, because position 2 is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)..., and position 3 is ...C(H)(C2H5)-CH2... So the two CH groups are attached to ethyl groups on both sides, but one is attached to the CH3 and the other to the CH2COOH.

So they are not equivalent. So their H's are in different environments.

Now, looking at the H's on these CH groups. Each H is adjacent to another CH group, which has a H, and also to ethyl groups. Wait, but ethyl groups don't have H adjacent that would split. Wait, the CH groups are each attached to an ethyl and another CH group.

So, the H on position 2 CH would be adjacent to the H on position 3 CH.

So, each H on position 2 and 3's CH would be split by the H on the other CH. So each would be a doublet.

But wait, also, each CH is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5). The ethyl group's CH2 would have H's that are adjacent to the CH's H.

Wait, let me think: the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, as well as the ethyl group's H's.

Wait, the ethyl group is C2H5, which is a CH2CH3. The CH2 is attached to the CH group (position 2). So the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group's H.

So, the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH. Similarly, the H on position 2's CH would be split by the H on the ethyl's CH2 and the H on position 3's CH.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me break it down.

For the H on position 2's CH:

Neighbors:

- The H on position 3's CH (vicinal coupling)
- The H's on the ethyl group's CH2 (which is attached to position 2's CH)

So, the H on position 2's CH is split by two different groups: the H on position 3's CH, and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl's CH2 is a single group. So the coupling would be between the H on position 2 and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

Wait, but each H on the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 2's CH. So the H on position 2's CH would be split by the ethyl's CH2 group into a triplet (since the ethyl's CH2 has two H's, leading to a triplet). Additionally, the H on position 3's CH would split it into a doublet.

So the splitting for the H on position 2's CH would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) multiplied by a doublet (from position 3's H), resulting in a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. Wait, order doesn't matter; it's the same as a triplet of doublets.

But the NMR data says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, so perhaps more splits.

Wait, maybe the ethyl's CH2 group is split by more than one neighbor.

Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to position 2's CH. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH. So each H on ethyl's CH2 would be a doublet. But since there are two H's, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

But the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to position 2's CH, which has a H. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet, as each H's coupling with the single H on position 2's CH.

But in the NMR, we also have a quartet in one of the signals. So perhaps another group is involved.

Wait, could the ethyl group's CH2 be adjacent to another group with three H's, leading to a quartet?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group adjacent to COOH in some options could have more H's.

Wait, let's consider option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, CH3 attached to a CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then CH2, then COOH.

Each of the middle CH groups has a CH3 and a H. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The CH3's on the middle CH's are attached to the same carbon as the H.

So, let's look at the H's on these CH groups.

Each CH group (positions 2 and 3) has a H and a CH3.

The H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and to the CH2 group (position 4).

Wait, position 4 is CH2, which is attached to COOH. So the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H's on position 3's CH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to H on position 3's CH and also to the H's on position 4's CH2.

So, the splitting for position 2's H would be from position 3's H (doublet) and from position 4's CH2 (which has two H's, so triplet). So, the H on position 2's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. So each H on CH2 (position 4) would be a doublet. But since there are two H's, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but what about the CH2 group? The CH2 is attached to the COOH. So the H's on CH2 would be split by the H on position 3's CH.

Each H on CH2 (position 4) is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet. Since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

Hmm, but the NMR data has a peak that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. So quartet would come from coupling to three H's. Where is that?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group that has two H's, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at option B.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, CH2CH3 attached to a CH group with C2H5, then another CH group with C2H5, then COOH.

So, the middle two CH groups each have a H and an ethyl group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

Each CH group (positions 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl group.

Now, looking at the H's on these CH groups.

The H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. Additionally, the ethyl group attached to position 2's CH has a CH2 group adjacent to the H on position 2's CH.

Wait, the ethyl group is C2H5, which is CH2CH3. The CH2 is attached to the position 2's CH. So the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl group's CH2.

So, the H on position 2's CH is split by two groups: the H on position 3's CH, and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) and a doublet (from position 3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 3's CH is adjacent to the H on position 2's CH and the ethyl group's CH2 (attached to position 3's CH). So the same applies: the H on position 3's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, the ethyl groups' CH2 would be split by the H's on their respective CH groups.

So, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to position 2's CH. The H's on ethyl's CH2 are split by the H on position 2's CH. Each H on ethyl's CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall peak would be a triplet.

Similarly, the ethyl group attached to position 3's CH would be a CH2 which is split by the H on position 3's CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So perhaps there is a quartet from another group.

Hmm, perhaps the ethyl groups are causing more splits. Let me think: the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to the CH group, which has a H. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 are split into a triplet due to the CH group's H. But each of the H's on the ethyl's CH2 is also adjacent to another group. Wait, the ethyl's CH2 is attached to the CH group, but perhaps the ethyl's CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group? No, because the ethyl is CH2CH3. So the ethyl's CH2 is only attached to the CH group and another CH3.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl's CH2 is split by the H on the CH group, but since the CH group's H is only one, that's the only split. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

But I'm not seeing where a quartet would come from. Unless another group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to the CH2 groups being next to multiple H's.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the CH groups are next to each other and also next to the ethyl's CH2 groups, leading to multiple splits.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the 1H NMR signals. The problem states that several peaks were observed, none of which are vinyl. So all the H's are on CH groups, CH2 groups, and the COOH.

But the key is the splitting patterns.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the CH groups each have a H and an ethyl group.

The H on each CH group (positions 2 and 3) would be adjacent to each other and also to the CH2 group.

Wait, the CH2 is attached to position 4 (before COOH). So position 4 is CH2, which is attached to COOH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and to the H's on position 4's CH2.

So, the H on position 2's CH would be split by the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the two H's on position 4's CH2 (triplet). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and possibly other groups.

Wait, but the CH2 group (position 4) is attached to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall signal would be a triplet.

But in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that would require three levels of splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H on position 4's CH2 is split by the H on position 3's CH (doublet), and also by another group with three H's, such as a CH3.

But where would that come from? The CH2 is attached to position 3's CH, which has a H and an ethyl group.

Ah, wait. The ethyl groups are C2H5, so each ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 are split by the H on the CH group. So each ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

So, for the H on position 2's CH: it is adjacent to position 3's CH (doublet) and position 4's CH2 (triplet from two H's). So the splitting would be doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to position 3's CH (doublet), and perhaps the ethyl group's H's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the H's on the ethyl's CH2 (attached to position 2's CH) are split by the H on position 2's CH into a triplet.

So, the ethyl's CH2 (position 2) would appear as a triplet.

But the NMR has a quartet as part of the splitting. So perhaps one of the H's is split into a quartet due to coupling with another three H's.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is also adjacent to another group with two H's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group (position 4) is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 (position 3). Wait, no. Position 4's CH2 is attached to COOH and position 3's CH. So, no.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the number of unique H environments in each option and how their splitting would look.

Looking back at the problem statement, the NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests a high level of splitting, implying that these H's are adjacent to multiple different groups with H's.

Let me think about the CH2 group in option A. The CH2 is attached to position 3's CH and to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet, but with two H's, so a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is also adjacent to another group with three H's, like a CH3, then each H on CH2 would be split into a quartet (three adjacent H's). But where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 elsewhere.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about which option would have the most complex splitting.

Option A's structure has two ethyl groups on the CH groups, and a CH2 near COOH. If the H's on the CH groups are next to each other and also next to the CH2, that could produce multiple splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or option C.

Wait, looking back at the FTIR, the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests a carboxylic acid. That's present in all options.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl H's is satisfied in all options.

The key is the splitting patterns. The NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, a quartet would require coupling with a group that has three H's. So, perhaps a CH3 group is adjacent to the H in question.

So, if a H is adjacent to a CH3 group, that would cause a quartet (n+1 where n=3 H's).

So, if in the structure, a certain H is next to a CH3, then that H would be a quartet.

Looking at the options, which structure has a H adjacent to a CH3 group?

Option A: The CH groups have ethyl groups, not CH3. So the H on CH are next to ethyl's CH2, which has two H's, not three.

Option B: Similarly, CH groups have ethyl groups.

Option C: The CH groups have CH3 groups attached. So the H on these CH groups would be adjacent to a CH3. So, their coupling would be a quartet.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me examine option C.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So, structure:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH (positions 2 and 3) has a H and a CH3 group.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and the CH2 group (position 4).

Wait, the CH2 group is attached to position 4 and COOH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to:

1. The H on position 3's CH (doublet)
2. The H's on position 4's CH2 (triplet)

So the splitting for position 2's H would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and perhaps the ethyl groups, but in this case, position 4's CH2 is attached to CH(CH3) and COOH.

Wait, but in option C, the CH2 is attached to position 3's CH and to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and possibly to the H's on COOH's adjacent groups. But COOH is a carbonyl group, so no H's adjacent on that side.

Wait, but the CH2 in option C is CH2COOH. So, the H's on CH2 would be next to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and to the COOH group, which has no H's adjacent. So, the splitting for CH2's H's would be a doublet from position 3's H, but since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

So, in option C, the H's on the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) would be doublet of triplets (from CH3?), wait no. Wait, the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) have a CH3 attached. So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to a CH3. So, the H on CH2 would couple with the three H's on CH3. That would lead to a quartet.

Wait, but wait, the CH3 is attached to the same carbon as the H. So, geminal coupling? But geminal coupling is usually not observed because the H's are on the same carbon and don't split each other. So, the H on the CH group (position 2) is not split by the CH3 attached to the same carbon.

Ah, right. So, the CH3 is on the same carbon as the H. So, the H is on the same carbon as the CH3, so no splitting from that. Therefore, the H is only split by adjacent H's.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the CH2 group (position 4) which has two H's (triplet). So, the H on position 2's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet), so the CH2 would be a triplet. 

But wait, the NMR data includes a quartet. So, where would a quartet come from in option C?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH3's on the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) would be split by something. The CH3 groups are attached to the same carbons as the H's. So their H's wouldn't split the H's on the CH groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm back to square one.

Let me think differently. The splitting in the NMR data is very complex. So, potentially, the structure has multiple H's that are all next to each other, leading to multiple coupling interactions.

Looking at the options, option A has two ethyl groups on the CH groups. Each ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH group. So, each ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet (from the CH group's H). Additionally, the H's on the CH groups would be split by each other and the CH2 groups.

So, for the H on the CH group (position 2 in option A), it would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 on its own side (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH, leading to a triplet.

But in option A, the CH2 group near COOH is attached to a CH group (position 3). So, the H's on that CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet. Since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

But the NMR data has a quartet in one of the signals. Where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH3 group. No, in option A, the CH2 is attached to a CH group with an ethyl, not a CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer is likely option A or D. Because in option D, the ethyl group is attached to the first CH group, which has a CH2CH3, whose CH2 is attached to the CH group. So, the CH2's H's would be split by the H on the CH group, leading to a triplet. The H on the CH group would be split by the CH2's H's (triplet) and the next CH group's H.

Wait, but in option D, the two CH groups are at the center, each with a CH3. So, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH and the ethyl's CH2.

So, the H on first CH would be a doublet (from second CH) and a triplet (from ethyl's CH2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

But the NMR has a quartet in one of the signals, which suggests coupling to three H's. So perhaps the H on the CH group is adjacent to a CH3 group on another carbon. But in option D, the CH groups have CH3, but the H's are on the same carbon as the CH3, so they wouldn't split.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group near COOH in option D is CH2COOH. So, the H's on that CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the second CH group. So, each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall signal would be a triplet.

But again, no quartet.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think of each option's structure and the possible NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: (CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the middle two CH groups each have a CH3 and a H.

H on first CH (attached to ethyl): adjacent to H on second CH and the ethyl's CH2. So, splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

H on second CH: adjacent to H on first CH and the CH2 near COOH. So, splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

The ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on first CH, leading to a triplet.

The CH2 near COOH would be adjacent to the H on second CH, leading to a triplet.

But where's the quartet?

Unless the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to another group with three H's. But the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is only attached to the CH group, not to any other CH3.

Wait, perhaps the quartet comes from the ethyl's CH2 being adjacent to a CH group that has a CH3. But the CH group's H is only one, so that would be a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2's splitting comes from two different sources. For example, the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group (doublet) and the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but in option D, the ethyl's CH2 is attached only to the CH group, not to any other CH2 groups.

I'm not seeing how a quartet would arise in any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the splitting in the NMR. The quartet would mean that the H is adjacent to a group with three H's, like a CH3.

If a H is adjacent to a CH3, it would be split into a quartet.

Looking back at the options, which structures have a H adjacent to a CH3 group?

Option A: The CH groups have ethyl groups (C2H5), so the H's on the CH are not adjacent to CH3.

Option B: Similarly, the CH groups have ethyl groups.

Option C: The CH groups have CH3 groups attached. So, the H on each CH is on the same carbon as a CH3. So, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH3, but as I thought earlier, geminal H's don't split each other.

Wait, but wait. The H on CH(CH3) is on the same carbon as a CH3. So, the H's on the CH3 are on the same carbon, but that's not adjacent. So, the H on CH(CH3) would not be split by the CH3's H's because they're on the same carbon. So, no quartet from that.

So, perhaps none of the options have a H adjacent to a CH3 group. So, why is there a quartet in the NMR data?

Hmm, maybe the quartet arises from coupling with a CH2 group. Wait, no, because a CH2 would have two H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from another source. Maybe the COOH group's adjacent CH2.

If the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, would that affect the splitting? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the splitting arises from coupling through multiple bonds. But that's usually not a major factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a neighboring group that is a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group near COOH in some structures is adjacent to a group with three H's. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH3 group.

Looking at option A: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH group with an ethyl. So, the CH2 is next to the CH group, which has a H and an ethyl. So, the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group and the ethyl's CH2. But that doesn't add up to three H's.

Option C: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH(CH3) group. The CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3) group. So, the CH2's H's would be split into a doublet, leading to a triplet.

No quartet.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from another source. Oh! The COOH group itself. The O-H proton is usually a broad peak, but it's not considered in the splitting patterns because it's exchanged and doesn't split other peaks. So, that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about which option has the most splitting, leading to the described NMR signals.

Option A has ethyl groups on the CH groups, which have CH2's that would each be split into triplets. The H's on the CH groups would be split by each other and the CH2's, leading to doublet of triplets.

The quartet in the NMR data must be from a H adjacent to a CH3 group. But none of the options have a H adjacent to a CH3 group except option C, but in option C, the H's are on the same carbon as the CH3, so no splitting.

Wait, unless I'm wrong about the geminal H's not splitting. But usually, geminal protons don't split each other because they are on the same carbon and J is usually considered negligible.

So, perhaps the quartet comes from the ethyl's CH2 being split by a CH3 group elsewhere. But I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps the quartet comes from the CH2 group being adjacent to a CH3 group. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH3 group.

Looking again at the options, which have a CH2 next to a CH3?

Option A: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH(CH3). So, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3), which has a CH3. So, the CH2's H's would be adjacent to three H's from the CH3. So, each H on the CH2 would be split into a quartet (n+1 where n=3).

Ah! That makes sense. So, in option A, the CH2 group attached to COOH is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group. The H's on the CH2 would be split by the three H's on the CH3, leading to a quartet.

Additionally, the H's on the CH2 would also be adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, each H on CH2 would be split by two groups: the three H's on CH3 (quartet) and the H on the CH group (doublet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of quartets.

Wait, but the NMR data has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, that would require three levels of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH group is adjacent to the CH2 group and another group.

Wait, the H on the CH group (attached to ethyl) would be adjacent to the H on the next CH group (doublet) and the CH2 group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the CH2 group's H's would be split by the CH3 (quartet) and the CH group's H (doublet), leading to a doublet of quartets, or a quartet of doublets.

But the NMR has a quartet as part of the splitting. So, the CH2 group's signal would be a quartet.

Putting it all together, in option A, the CH2 group's H's would be a quartet due to the adjacent CH3, and a doublet due to the adjacent CH group's H. So, it would be a doublet of quartets, which could be described as a quartet of doublets.

But the NMR data includes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So perhaps another group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the H on the CH group is adjacent to the CH2 group (triplet) and the H on the next CH group (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, combining all this, option A's structure would have:

- CH groups' H's: doublet of triplets
- ethyl's CH2 groups: triplets
- CH2 near COOH: quartet and doublet, leading to a doublet of quartets or quartet of doublets.

But the NMR data has a quartet as part of the splitting, so perhaps this fits.

So, looking back at the options, option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group, leading the CH2's H's to be split into a quartet. So, one of the NMR signals would be a quartet.

Another H in the structure is the H on the CH group, which is split by two groups (CH2 and another CH), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, the NMR would have a quartet and a doublet of triplets, perhaps.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (so three splits), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to match the options with the data.

The correct answer is likely option A because it's the only option where the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH3 group, leading to a quartet. The other splitting can be explained with doublets and triplets.

Wait, no. Because in option A, the CH2 is attached to a CH(CH3) group, so the CH2's H's are adjacent to the CH3's three H's, making them quartets. Additionally, the CH2's H's are adjacent to the H on the CH group, making them doublets. So, the CH2's H's would be a quartet of doublets or a doublet of quartets.

So, the CH2's signal would be a doublet of quartets.

The H's on the CH groups would be split by each other (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, the NMR would have a doublet of triplets for the CH groups and a doublet of quartets for the CH2 group.

This matches the NMR data, which includes a doublet of triplets of quartets (which is a quartet of doublets) and a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three splits. So, perhaps the CH2's quartet is split into a doublet, making a quartet of doublets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to think about the number of unique proton environments.

In option A, the structure has:

1. The CH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be split into a triplet due to the adjacent CH group's H.

2. The two CH groups (each with a H and an ethyl): each H on these CH groups would be split into a doublet of triplets.

3. The CH2 group near COOH: split into a quartet due to the adjacent CH3, and a doublet due to the adjacent CH group's H.

Thus, the NMR would have:

- a triplet from the ethyl's CH2.

- a doublet of triplets from the CH groups.

- a quartet of doublets from the CH2 near COOH.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the CH2 near COOH's signal is a quartet split by the CH group's H, leading to a quartet of doublets, which would be a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group's H is split by both the CH2 group (triplet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a quintet. But that doesn't match the data.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the quartet arising from the CH2 near COOH being adjacent to a CH3 group, option A seems the most likely candidate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ (indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid) and a strong absorption at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ (C=O stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid). The $^1$H NMR spectrum indicates no vinyl hydrogens and complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH$_3$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)CH$_2$COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-CH$_2$-COOH.
- The CH$_2$ group near the COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. This would cause the CH$_2$ protons to couple with the three protons of the CH$_3$ group, resulting in a quartet. Additionally, the CH$_2$ protons would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. Thus, the CH$_2$ signal would appear as a doublet of quartets.
- The H on each CH group (positions 2 and 3) is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- This option matches the NMR data, including the presence of a quartet.

#### **Option B: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-COOH.
- The CH groups each have an ethyl group (C$_2$H$_5$). The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- However, there is no CH$_3$ group adjacent to the CH$_2$ group near COOH, so the CH$_2$ protons would not produce a quartet. This option does not fully match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH$_3$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)CH$_2$COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$-COOH.
- The CH groups each have a CH$_3$ group. However, geminal protons (H and CH$_3$ on the same carbon) do not couple, so the CH$_3$ groups would not split the CH protons. The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- The CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. However, the CH$_3$ group does not split the CH$_2$ protons into a quartet because the CH$_3$ protons are not adjacent to the CH$_2$ protons. This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-COOH.
- The CH groups each have a CH$_3$ group. The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- The CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. However, the CH$_3$ group does not split the CH$_2$ protons into a quartet because the CH$_3$ protons are not adjacent to the CH$_2$ protons. This option does not match the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only structure where the CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group, leading to a quartet for the CH$_2$ protons. This matches the NMR data, which includes a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of the unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The compound is an unknown, and we've used FTIR and 1H NMR to characterize it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, some complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, so what does the FTIR tell me? The broad peak around 3000 is likely due to O-H stretch, probably from a carboxylic acid group. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H bonds that absorb in that region and are usually broad. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably the C=O stretch, also typical of carboxylic acids. So the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now looking at the NMR. There are no vinyl hydrogens, which means no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the structure doesn't have any alkenes or similar groups. All the hydrogens are in more saturated environments, like single bonds.

In the NMR, we have a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated, but maybe it's due to splitting from neighboring groups. Let me think about how splitting works. Each peak is split by neighboring equivalent protons. So a doublet of triplets suggests that a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. For example, maybe adjacent to a CH₂ group and another CH group?

Wait, maybe looking at the structures provided in the options can help. Let me list the options again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, the first part of each option is a bit similar. Let's parse them:

Looking at the structures, each has a COOH group at the end. The structure before COOH is varying. Let me think about each option's structure.

Option A: The chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So that's like two substituents on each of the middle carbons. Specifically, each middle carbon (the two in the middle) has a methyl and an ethyl group attached. Wait, no. Let me see: the formula is CH3[C(H)(C2H5)]2CH2COOH? Or is it CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons (positions 2 and 3) has a methyl and ethyl group attached, and the next carbon is CH2 connected to COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the chain is CH2CH3 attached to a C(H)(C2H5), then another C(H)(C2H5), and then COOH. Wait, so maybe it's CH2CH2... No, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. The first part is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the first carbon is CH3CH2-, then a carbon attached to H and C2H5, then another same carbon, then COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (positions 2 and 3) have a methyl group and a hydrogen. The next carbon is CH2 and then COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the first part is CH3CH2, then a carbon with H and CH3, then another same carbon, then COOH.

Wait, so in each structure, the middle part is a geminal di-substitution? Or perhaps it's a structure where each of the middle carbons is attached to two substituents and a hydrogen.

Now, considering the NMR data. No vinyl hydrogens, which all options satisfy because there's no double bonds. The NMR has complex splitting, so maybe the structure has several sets of equivalent hydrogens that split each other.

In particular, the signals are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Let me think about how that could happen.

Looking at the splitting, a quartet would come from a neighboring group with three equivalent protons, like a CH3. A triplet would come from a neighboring group with two protons, like a CH2. So, perhaps a proton is split by two different adjacent groups.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (which would split into a triplet) and also next to another group with two protons (another triplet), that could result in a triplet of triplets. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, a certain proton is adjacent to two different groups. Let me think about each option.

Starting with option D: structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the middle two carbons each have a CH3 and a H. The structure would look like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH? Wait, no. Let me write it as:

CH2CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So each of the two middle carbons has a CH3 and a H. So each of these carbons has two substituents: a methyl and a hydrogen.

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2... No, let's think of the actual structure.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the four carbons before COOH are:

1: CH3CH2-

2: CH(CH3)

3: CH(CH3)

4: COOH.

Wait, but the structure would be CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the molecule is: 

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's CH2CH3 connected to a carbon that has H and CH3 (so CH(CH3)), then another carbon with H and CH3, and then COOH.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, wait. The first part is CH3CH2- (so ethyl group), connected to a CH that's attached to CH3, then another CH attached to CH3, then COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (2 and 3) has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group? No, wait. Wait, the substituents are attached to each CH.

In this structure, the middle two carbons are CH(CH3) groups, so each has a CH3 and a H. So the structure is:

Ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH(CH3), which is attached to COOH.

Now, looking at the NMR, the signals would come from different types of H.

The COOH group is at the end, so the H on the COOH would be a broad singlet, but the problem says none of the NMR peaks are vinyl, which we already accounted for. So the protons we are seeing are on the other carbons.

In option D, which is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the two middle CH groups have a H and a CH3. Are these equivalent? Let's see. The two CH groups are in the middle. Are they equivalent through symmetry? If the molecule is symmetrical, then perhaps the two CH groups are equivalent.

Wait, the structure would be something like:

   CH2CH3
    |
CH3-C - C - COOH
    |     |
    H     H
    |
    CH3  CH3

Wait, no. Each of the two middle carbons is CH(CH3). So, each has a CH3 and a CH2CH3? No, wait. No, the structure is CH3CH2 attached to the first CH group.

Let me think about the symmetry. The two middle carbons are both CH(CH3) and connected to each other. So the molecule is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Is there any symmetry? The two CH(CH3) groups are connected to each other, so perhaps they are equivalent.

In that case, the H on each CH(CH3) would be equivalent. So the H on the first CH(CH3) (attached to the ethyl group) and the H on the second CH(CH3) (attached to the COOH) would be different because their environments are different. Because the first is next to ethyl, the second next to COOH.

Hmm, but perhaps not. Let me visualize the structure. The molecule is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the first CH is connected to ethyl, and the second CH is connected to COOH.

So the two CH groups are not equivalent because their substituents are different on each side. So the H on the first CH would be split by neighboring groups, and the H on the second CH would also be split.

Wait, let's see how each H would appear in the NMR.

The first CH, attached to the ethyl group, is adjacent to which other groups? It's connected to the ethyl (CH2CH3), and its neighboring CH (which is the second CH group). So the H on the first CH is adjacent to the second CH group. The second CH group's H is adjacent to both the first CH and the COOH group.

Wait, but the COOH is a carbonyl group. So the H on the second CH is adjacent to another CH group and to the COOH's CH2 (if any). Wait, the COOH is directly attached to the second CH, so the H on the second CH is adjacent to the COOH group.

Hold on, perhaps a better approach is to look for the splitting patterns in each option.

Looking at the NMR data: two complex splitting patterns. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, a quartet would be from a neighboring group with 3 equivalent protons, like CH3. A triplet is from a neighboring group with 2 equivalent protons, like CH2.

So, imagine a proton that is next to a CH2 group and a CH3 group. Then, each of these would cause splitting.

Let me think about each option's structure and see which one would produce such splitting.

Option D's structure: CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The first CH(CH3) (let's call this CH1) is attached to CH2CH3 and to CH2 (the next CH(CH3) group, CH2).

Wait, no. The structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So CH1 is CH(CH3) attached to CH2CH3 and to CH2 (the CH(CH3) group). Similarly, CH2 is CH(CH3) attached to CH1 and to COOH.

Each CH group has a H and a CH3.

So the H on CH1 is adjacent to CH2. CH2's H is adjacent to CH1 and the COOH.

Wait, but how does this affect splitting? Hmm.

Each H on CH1 would be split by the H on CH2. Let's think: the H on CH1 is adjacent to the H on CH2. So, if CH2 has one H, then the splitting would be a doublet. But wait, if there are two H's on CH2? Wait, no. Each CH group has only one H.

Wait, no. Each of the CH groups in option D has only one H. So each H on CH1 is next to the H on CH2.

So, for the H on CH1, the adjacent H is on CH2. So each would split into a doublet. But that's just a simple doublet.

Wait, maybe more complex. Let me think about vicinal coupling. The H on CH1 is adjacent to the H on CH2. So, each would be a doublet. So each would be split into a doublet due to the other.

But that would only give a doublet for each H. But the NMR data shows more complex splitting, like doublet of triplets, etc. So perhaps that's not where the complexity is coming from.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would cause splitting. The H on ethyl are split by adjacent H's.

Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3. The CH2 would be next to the CH group (CH1). So the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on CH1.

Wait, perhaps that's a possibility.

Let me consider the ethyl group. The CH2 in ethyl (CH2CH3) is attached to the CH1 group. So the H's on the ethyl CH2 would each be adjacent to the H on CH1.

So the ethyl CH2 would be a triplet because each H on CH2 is adjacent to CH1's H (which is a single H, so splitting into a doublet, but wait, no. The splitting depends on the number of neighboring H's.

Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to the CH1. So the CH2 is adjacent to CH1's H. Each H on the CH2 is next to the H on CH1. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the H on CH1. Since the CH2 has two H's, each of their environments would be influenced by the H on CH1.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the CH2 is split by the H on CH1. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet because of the single H on CH1. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, the splitting would result in a triplet for the CH2. Because the coupling is between two sets: each of the two H's on CH2 would be split by the H on CH1, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The ethyl CH2 is attached to CH1, which has one H. The H's on the ethyl CH2 are adjacent to the H on CH1. So each H on the ethyl CH2 would couple with the single H on CH1. So each H on ethyl CH2 would have a doublet. But since they are two equivalent H's on the same CH2, the splitting would be a triplet for the CH2 group.

Wait, no, wait. The ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to a CH that has one H. So the two H's on CH2 are each split by that single H into a doublet. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, their combined peak would be a triplet for the ethyl CH2 group.

So the ethyl CH2 would appear as a triplet. But in the NMR data, we have a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps the complex splitting comes from another part of the molecule.

Wait, maybe the splitting is due to multiple neighboring groups. Let me think about option A.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Wait, the structure is CH3 attached to a C(H)(C2H5), then another C(H)(C2H5), then CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the first carbon is CH3 attached to a CH group (C(H)(C2H5)), which is connected to another similar CH group, then a CH2, then COOH.

Each of the two CH groups (positions 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl (C2H5) group.

So, the two CH groups are each attached to ethyl and H.

So, each CH (position 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl group.

Now, considering the symmetry: if the two CH groups are identical in environment, then their H's would be equivalent. So perhaps the H on CH2 and CH3 are the same, leading to a singlet? But that might not be the case.

Wait, position 2: CH attached to CH3 and C2H5.

Position 3: CH attached to C2H5 and CH2COOH.

Wait, no, because position 2 is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)..., and position 3 is ...C(H)(C2H5)-CH2... So the two CH groups are attached to ethyl groups on both sides, but one is attached to the CH3 and the other to the CH2COOH.

So they are not equivalent. So their H's are in different environments.

Now, looking at the H's on these CH groups. Each H is adjacent to another CH group, which has a H, and also to ethyl groups. Wait, but ethyl groups don't have H adjacent that would split. Wait, the CH groups are each attached to an ethyl and another CH group.

So, the H on position 2 CH would be adjacent to the H on position 3 CH.

So, each H on position 2 and 3's CH would be split by the H on the other CH. So each would be a doublet.

But wait, also, each CH is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5). The ethyl group's CH2 would have H's that are adjacent to the CH's H.

Wait, let me think: the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, as well as the ethyl group's H's.

Wait, the ethyl group is C2H5, which is a CH2CH3. The CH2 is attached to the CH group (position 2). So the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group's H.

So, the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH. Similarly, the H on position 2's CH would be split by the H on the ethyl's CH2 and the H on position 3's CH.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me break it down.

For the H on position 2's CH:

Neighbors:

- The H on position 3's CH (vicinal coupling)
- The H's on the ethyl group's CH2 (which is attached to position 2's CH)

So, the H on position 2's CH is split by two different groups: the H on position 3's CH, and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl's CH2 is a single group. So the coupling would be between the H on position 2 and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

Wait, but each H on the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 2's CH. So the H on position 2's CH would be split by the ethyl's CH2 group into a triplet (since the ethyl's CH2 has two H's, leading to a triplet). Additionally, the H on position 3's CH would split it into a doublet.

So the splitting for the H on position 2's CH would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) multiplied by a doublet (from position 3's H), resulting in a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. Wait, order doesn't matter; it's the same as a triplet of doublets.

But the NMR data says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, so perhaps more splits.

Wait, maybe the ethyl's CH2 group is split by more than one neighbor.

Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to position 2's CH. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH. So each H on ethyl's CH2 would be a doublet. But since there are two H's, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

But the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to position 2's CH, which has a H. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet, as each H's coupling with the single H on position 2's CH.

But in the NMR, we also have a quartet in one of the signals. So perhaps another group is involved.

Wait, could the ethyl group's CH2 be adjacent to another group with three H's, leading to a quartet?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group adjacent to COOH in some options could have more H's.

Wait, let's consider option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, CH3 attached to a CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then CH2, then COOH.

Each of the middle CH groups has a CH3 and a H. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The CH3's on the middle CH's are attached to the same carbon as the H.

So, let's look at the H's on these CH groups.

Each CH group (positions 2 and 3) has a H and a CH3.

The H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and to the CH2 group (position 4).

Wait, position 4 is CH2, which is attached to COOH. So the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H's on position 3's CH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to H on position 3's CH and also to the H's on position 4's CH2.

So, the splitting for position 2's H would be from position 3's H (doublet) and from position 4's CH2 (which has two H's, so triplet). So, the H on position 2's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. So each H on CH2 (position 4) would be a doublet. But since there are two H's, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but what about the CH2 group? The CH2 is attached to the COOH. So the H's on CH2 would be split by the H on position 3's CH.

Each H on CH2 (position 4) is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet. Since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

Hmm, but the NMR data has a peak that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. So quartet would come from coupling to three H's. Where is that?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group that has two H's, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at option B.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, CH2CH3 attached to a CH group with C2H5, then another CH group with C2H5, then COOH.

So, the middle two CH groups each have a H and an ethyl group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

Each CH group (positions 2 and 3) has a H and an ethyl group.

Now, looking at the H's on these CH groups.

The H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. Additionally, the ethyl group attached to position 2's CH has a CH2 group adjacent to the H on position 2's CH.

Wait, the ethyl group is C2H5, which is CH2CH3. The CH2 is attached to the position 2's CH. So the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl group's CH2.

So, the H on position 2's CH is split by two groups: the H on position 3's CH, and the two H's on the ethyl's CH2.

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) and a doublet (from position 3's H), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 3's CH is adjacent to the H on position 2's CH and the ethyl group's CH2 (attached to position 3's CH). So the same applies: the H on position 3's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, the ethyl groups' CH2 would be split by the H's on their respective CH groups.

So, the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to position 2's CH. The H's on ethyl's CH2 are split by the H on position 2's CH. Each H on ethyl's CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall peak would be a triplet.

Similarly, the ethyl group attached to position 3's CH would be a CH2 which is split by the H on position 3's CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So perhaps there is a quartet from another group.

Hmm, perhaps the ethyl groups are causing more splits. Let me think: the ethyl group's CH2 is attached to the CH group, which has a H. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 are split into a triplet due to the CH group's H. But each of the H's on the ethyl's CH2 is also adjacent to another group. Wait, the ethyl's CH2 is attached to the CH group, but perhaps the ethyl's CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group? No, because the ethyl is CH2CH3. So the ethyl's CH2 is only attached to the CH group and another CH3.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl's CH2 is split by the H on the CH group, but since the CH group's H is only one, that's the only split. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

But I'm not seeing where a quartet would come from. Unless another group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to the CH2 groups being next to multiple H's.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the CH groups are next to each other and also next to the ethyl's CH2 groups, leading to multiple splits.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the 1H NMR signals. The problem states that several peaks were observed, none of which are vinyl. So all the H's are on CH groups, CH2 groups, and the COOH.

But the key is the splitting patterns.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the CH groups each have a H and an ethyl group.

The H on each CH group (positions 2 and 3) would be adjacent to each other and also to the CH2 group.

Wait, the CH2 is attached to position 4 (before COOH). So position 4 is CH2, which is attached to COOH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and to the H's on position 4's CH2.

So, the H on position 2's CH would be split by the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the two H's on position 4's CH2 (triplet). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and possibly other groups.

Wait, but the CH2 group (position 4) is attached to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall signal would be a triplet.

But in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that would require three levels of splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H on position 4's CH2 is split by the H on position 3's CH (doublet), and also by another group with three H's, such as a CH3.

But where would that come from? The CH2 is attached to position 3's CH, which has a H and an ethyl group.

Ah, wait. The ethyl groups are C2H5, so each ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The H's on the ethyl's CH2 are split by the H on the CH group. So each ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

So, for the H on position 2's CH: it is adjacent to position 3's CH (doublet) and position 4's CH2 (triplet from two H's). So the splitting would be doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to position 3's CH (doublet), and perhaps the ethyl group's H's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the H's on the ethyl's CH2 (attached to position 2's CH) are split by the H on position 2's CH into a triplet.

So, the ethyl's CH2 (position 2) would appear as a triplet.

But the NMR has a quartet as part of the splitting. So perhaps one of the H's is split into a quartet due to coupling with another three H's.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is also adjacent to another group with two H's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group (position 4) is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 (position 3). Wait, no. Position 4's CH2 is attached to COOH and position 3's CH. So, no.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the number of unique H environments in each option and how their splitting would look.

Looking back at the problem statement, the NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests a high level of splitting, implying that these H's are adjacent to multiple different groups with H's.

Let me think about the CH2 group in option A. The CH2 is attached to position 3's CH and to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet, but with two H's, so a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is also adjacent to another group with three H's, like a CH3, then each H on CH2 would be split into a quartet (three adjacent H's). But where would that come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 elsewhere.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about which option would have the most complex splitting.

Option A's structure has two ethyl groups on the CH groups, and a CH2 near COOH. If the H's on the CH groups are next to each other and also next to the CH2, that could produce multiple splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or option C.

Wait, looking back at the FTIR, the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests a carboxylic acid. That's present in all options.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl H's is satisfied in all options.

The key is the splitting patterns. The NMR has a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, a quartet would require coupling with a group that has three H's. So, perhaps a CH3 group is adjacent to the H in question.

So, if a H is adjacent to a CH3 group, that would cause a quartet (n+1 where n=3 H's).

So, if in the structure, a certain H is next to a CH3, then that H would be a quartet.

Looking at the options, which structure has a H adjacent to a CH3 group?

Option A: The CH groups have ethyl groups, not CH3. So the H on CH are next to ethyl's CH2, which has two H's, not three.

Option B: Similarly, CH groups have ethyl groups.

Option C: The CH groups have CH3 groups attached. So the H on these CH groups would be adjacent to a CH3. So, their coupling would be a quartet.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me examine option C.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So, structure:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH (positions 2 and 3) has a H and a CH3 group.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH and the CH2 group (position 4).

Wait, the CH2 group is attached to position 4 and COOH.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to:

1. The H on position 3's CH (doublet)
2. The H's on position 4's CH2 (triplet)

So the splitting for position 2's H would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and perhaps the ethyl groups, but in this case, position 4's CH2 is attached to CH(CH3) and COOH.

Wait, but in option C, the CH2 is attached to position 3's CH and to COOH. The H's on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and possibly to the H's on COOH's adjacent groups. But COOH is a carbonyl group, so no H's adjacent on that side.

Wait, but the CH2 in option C is CH2COOH. So, the H's on CH2 would be next to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and to the COOH group, which has no H's adjacent. So, the splitting for CH2's H's would be a doublet from position 3's H, but since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

So, in option C, the H's on the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) would be doublet of triplets (from CH3?), wait no. Wait, the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) have a CH3 attached. So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to a CH3. So, the H on CH2 would couple with the three H's on CH3. That would lead to a quartet.

Wait, but wait, the CH3 is attached to the same carbon as the H. So, geminal coupling? But geminal coupling is usually not observed because the H's are on the same carbon and don't split each other. So, the H on the CH group (position 2) is not split by the CH3 attached to the same carbon.

Ah, right. So, the CH3 is on the same carbon as the H. So, the H is on the same carbon as the CH3, so no splitting from that. Therefore, the H is only split by adjacent H's.

So, the H on position 2's CH is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the CH2 group (position 4) which has two H's (triplet). So, the H on position 2's CH would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on position 4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet), so the CH2 would be a triplet. 

But wait, the NMR data includes a quartet. So, where would a quartet come from in option C?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH3's on the CH groups (positions 2 and 3) would be split by something. The CH3 groups are attached to the same carbons as the H's. So their H's wouldn't split the H's on the CH groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm back to square one.

Let me think differently. The splitting in the NMR data is very complex. So, potentially, the structure has multiple H's that are all next to each other, leading to multiple coupling interactions.

Looking at the options, option A has two ethyl groups on the CH groups. Each ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH group. So, each ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet (from the CH group's H). Additionally, the H's on the CH groups would be split by each other and the CH2 groups.

So, for the H on the CH group (position 2 in option A), it would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 on its own side (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on position 2's CH, leading to a triplet.

But in option A, the CH2 group near COOH is attached to a CH group (position 3). So, the H's on that CH2 would be adjacent to the H on position 3's CH, leading to a doublet. Since there are two H's on CH2, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

But the NMR data has a quartet in one of the signals. Where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH3 group. No, in option A, the CH2 is attached to a CH group with an ethyl, not a CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer is likely option A or D. Because in option D, the ethyl group is attached to the first CH group, which has a CH2CH3, whose CH2 is attached to the CH group. So, the CH2's H's would be split by the H on the CH group, leading to a triplet. The H on the CH group would be split by the CH2's H's (triplet) and the next CH group's H.

Wait, but in option D, the two CH groups are at the center, each with a CH3. So, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH and the ethyl's CH2.

So, the H on first CH would be a doublet (from second CH) and a triplet (from ethyl's CH2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet.

But the NMR has a quartet in one of the signals, which suggests coupling to three H's. So perhaps the H on the CH group is adjacent to a CH3 group on another carbon. But in option D, the CH groups have CH3, but the H's are on the same carbon as the CH3, so they wouldn't split.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group near COOH in option D is CH2COOH. So, the H's on that CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the second CH group. So, each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall signal would be a triplet.

But again, no quartet.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think of each option's structure and the possible NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: (CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the middle two CH groups each have a CH3 and a H.

H on first CH (attached to ethyl): adjacent to H on second CH and the ethyl's CH2. So, splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

H on second CH: adjacent to H on first CH and the CH2 near COOH. So, splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

The ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on first CH, leading to a triplet.

The CH2 near COOH would be adjacent to the H on second CH, leading to a triplet.

But where's the quartet?

Unless the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to another group with three H's. But the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is only attached to the CH group, not to any other CH3.

Wait, perhaps the quartet comes from the ethyl's CH2 being adjacent to a CH group that has a CH3. But the CH group's H is only one, so that would be a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2's splitting comes from two different sources. For example, the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH group (doublet) and the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but in option D, the ethyl's CH2 is attached only to the CH group, not to any other CH2 groups.

I'm not seeing how a quartet would arise in any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the splitting in the NMR. The quartet would mean that the H is adjacent to a group with three H's, like a CH3.

If a H is adjacent to a CH3, it would be split into a quartet.

Looking back at the options, which structures have a H adjacent to a CH3 group?

Option A: The CH groups have ethyl groups (C2H5), so the H's on the CH are not adjacent to CH3.

Option B: Similarly, the CH groups have ethyl groups.

Option C: The CH groups have CH3 groups attached. So, the H on each CH is on the same carbon as a CH3. So, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH3, but as I thought earlier, geminal H's don't split each other.

Wait, but wait. The H on CH(CH3) is on the same carbon as a CH3. So, the H's on the CH3 are on the same carbon, but that's not adjacent. So, the H on CH(CH3) would not be split by the CH3's H's because they're on the same carbon. So, no quartet from that.

So, perhaps none of the options have a H adjacent to a CH3 group. So, why is there a quartet in the NMR data?

Hmm, maybe the quartet arises from coupling with a CH2 group. Wait, no, because a CH2 would have two H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from another source. Maybe the COOH group's adjacent CH2.

If the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, would that affect the splitting? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the splitting arises from coupling through multiple bonds. But that's usually not a major factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a neighboring group that is a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group near COOH in some structures is adjacent to a group with three H's. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH3 group.

Looking at option A: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH group with an ethyl. So, the CH2 is next to the CH group, which has a H and an ethyl. So, the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group and the ethyl's CH2. But that doesn't add up to three H's.

Option C: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH(CH3) group. The CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3) group. So, the CH2's H's would be split into a doublet, leading to a triplet.

No quartet.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from another source. Oh! The COOH group itself. The O-H proton is usually a broad peak, but it's not considered in the splitting patterns because it's exchanged and doesn't split other peaks. So, that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about which option has the most splitting, leading to the described NMR signals.

Option A has ethyl groups on the CH groups, which have CH2's that would each be split into triplets. The H's on the CH groups would be split by each other and the CH2's, leading to doublet of triplets.

The quartet in the NMR data must be from a H adjacent to a CH3 group. But none of the options have a H adjacent to a CH3 group except option C, but in option C, the H's are on the same carbon as the CH3, so no splitting.

Wait, unless I'm wrong about the geminal H's not splitting. But usually, geminal protons don't split each other because they are on the same carbon and J is usually considered negligible.

So, perhaps the quartet comes from the ethyl's CH2 being split by a CH3 group elsewhere. But I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps the quartet comes from the CH2 group being adjacent to a CH3 group. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH3 group.

Looking again at the options, which have a CH2 next to a CH3?

Option A: The CH2 near COOH is attached to a CH(CH3). So, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3), which has a CH3. So, the CH2's H's would be adjacent to three H's from the CH3. So, each H on the CH2 would be split into a quartet (n+1 where n=3).

Ah! That makes sense. So, in option A, the CH2 group attached to COOH is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group. The H's on the CH2 would be split by the three H's on the CH3, leading to a quartet.

Additionally, the H's on the CH2 would also be adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, each H on CH2 would be split by two groups: the three H's on CH3 (quartet) and the H on the CH group (doublet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of quartets.

Wait, but the NMR data has a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, that would require three levels of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH group is adjacent to the CH2 group and another group.

Wait, the H on the CH group (attached to ethyl) would be adjacent to the H on the next CH group (doublet) and the CH2 group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But the CH2 group's H's would be split by the CH3 (quartet) and the CH group's H (doublet), leading to a doublet of quartets, or a quartet of doublets.

But the NMR has a quartet as part of the splitting. So, the CH2 group's signal would be a quartet.

Putting it all together, in option A, the CH2 group's H's would be a quartet due to the adjacent CH3, and a doublet due to the adjacent CH group's H. So, it would be a doublet of quartets, which could be described as a quartet of doublets.

But the NMR data includes a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So perhaps another group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the H on the CH group is adjacent to the CH2 group (triplet) and the H on the next CH group (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, combining all this, option A's structure would have:

- CH groups' H's: doublet of triplets
- ethyl's CH2 groups: triplets
- CH2 near COOH: quartet and doublet, leading to a doublet of quartets or quartet of doublets.

But the NMR data has a quartet as part of the splitting, so perhaps this fits.

So, looking back at the options, option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group, leading the CH2's H's to be split into a quartet. So, one of the NMR signals would be a quartet.

Another H in the structure is the H on the CH group, which is split by two groups (CH2 and another CH), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, the NMR would have a quartet and a doublet of triplets, perhaps.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (so three splits), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to match the options with the data.

The correct answer is likely option A because it's the only option where the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH3 group, leading to a quartet. The other splitting can be explained with doublets and triplets.

Wait, no. Because in option A, the CH2 is attached to a CH(CH3) group, so the CH2's H's are adjacent to the CH3's three H's, making them quartets. Additionally, the CH2's H's are adjacent to the H on the CH group, making them doublets. So, the CH2's H's would be a quartet of doublets or a doublet of quartets.

So, the CH2's signal would be a doublet of quartets.

The H's on the CH groups would be split by each other (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So, the NMR would have a doublet of triplets for the CH groups and a doublet of quartets for the CH2 group.

This matches the NMR data, which includes a doublet of triplets of quartets (which is a quartet of doublets) and a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three splits. So, perhaps the CH2's quartet is split into a doublet, making a quartet of doublets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to think about the number of unique proton environments.

In option A, the structure has:

1. The CH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be split into a triplet due to the adjacent CH group's H.

2. The two CH groups (each with a H and an ethyl): each H on these CH groups would be split into a doublet of triplets.

3. The CH2 group near COOH: split into a quartet due to the adjacent CH3, and a doublet due to the adjacent CH group's H.

Thus, the NMR would have:

- a triplet from the ethyl's CH2.

- a doublet of triplets from the CH groups.

- a quartet of doublets from the CH2 near COOH.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the CH2 near COOH's signal is a quartet split by the CH group's H, leading to a quartet of doublets, which would be a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group's H is split by both the CH2 group (triplet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a quintet. But that doesn't match the data.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the quartet arising from the CH2 near COOH being adjacent to a CH3 group, option A seems the most likely candidate.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ (indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid) and a strong absorption at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ (C=O stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid). The $^1$H NMR spectrum indicates no vinyl hydrogens and complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH$_3$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)CH$_2$COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-CH$_2$-COOH.
- The CH$_2$ group near the COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. This would cause the CH$_2$ protons to couple with the three protons of the CH$_3$ group, resulting in a quartet. Additionally, the CH$_2$ protons would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. Thus, the CH$_2$ signal would appear as a doublet of quartets.
- The H on each CH group (positions 2 and 3) is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- This option matches the NMR data, including the presence of a quartet.

#### **Option B: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-C(H)(C$_2$H$_5$)-COOH.
- The CH groups each have an ethyl group (C$_2$H$_5$). The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- However, there is no CH$_3$ group adjacent to the CH$_2$ group near COOH, so the CH$_2$ protons would not produce a quartet. This option does not fully match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH$_3$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)CH$_2$COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$-COOH.
- The CH groups each have a CH$_3$ group. However, geminal protons (H and CH$_3$ on the same carbon) do not couple, so the CH$_3$ groups would not split the CH protons. The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- The CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. However, the CH$_3$ group does not split the CH$_2$ protons into a quartet because the CH$_3$ protons are not adjacent to the CH$_2$ protons. This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH$_3$CH$_2$C(H)(CH$_3$)C(H)(CH$_3$)COOH**
- Structure: CH$_3$CH$_2$-C(H)(CH$_3$)-C(H)(CH$_3$)-COOH.
- The CH groups each have a CH$_3$ group. The H on each CH group would couple with the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the CH$_2$ group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- The CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group. However, the CH$_3$ group does not split the CH$_2$ protons into a quartet because the CH$_3$ protons are not adjacent to the CH$_2$ protons. This option does not match the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only structure where the CH$_2$ group near COOH is adjacent to a CH group with a CH$_3$ group, leading to a quartet for the CH$_2$ protons. This matches the NMR data, which includes a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.
