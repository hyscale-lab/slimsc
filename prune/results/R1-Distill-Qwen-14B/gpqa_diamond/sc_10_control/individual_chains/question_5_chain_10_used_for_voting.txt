Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says the operator is P_vec, which is a vector operator made up of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for this operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So that means the vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So any direction in x-z would have angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe φ isn't fixed. But for the eigenvector, maybe I don't need to worry about φ because the operator is along n and we're looking for eigenstates.

Wait, no. The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me write down the matrices for each component.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the matrices, let's compute that.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So,

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying those matrices:

First term (from sinθ):
[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Second term (from cosθ):
[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now I need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let's write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) * [a; b]

Wait no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

(ħ/2) * M * v = (ħ/2) * v

Where M is the matrix [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So I can divide both sides by (ħ/2), getting:

M v = v

So (M - I) v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the matrix equation:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] * [a; b] = [0; 0]

So the equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These are two equations.

Let me write them:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for a and b. Let me first write equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Wait, because (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ), so (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ).

So equation 1: -(1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Alternatively, since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), the ratio becomes [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ] = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

Wait, but let me think in terms of variables. Let me take b as a parameter, say b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), then a = [sinθ / (1 - cosθ)].

Alternatively, I can substitute a in equation 2 and see if it's consistent.

So equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substitute a from equation 1:

sinθ [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) b ] + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Compute this:

[ sin²θ / (1 - cosθ) ) + (-cosθ -1) ] b = 0

Factor out b:

[ sin²θ/(1 - cosθ) - (cosθ +1) ] = 0

Hmm, let's compute this expression:

We know that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, so:

[ (1 - cos²θ)/(1 - cosθ) ) - (cosθ +1) ]

Simplify (1 - cos²θ) = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ), so the numerator becomes (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ), denominator (1 - cosθ) → (1 + cosθ).

So the expression becomes:

(1 + cosθ) - (cosθ +1) = 0. So it's zero. So equation 2 is automatically satisfied given equation 1. So any solution from equation 1 would satisfy equation 2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] where a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

But let's express a in terms of b. Let me express 1 - cosθ as 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ as 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b → [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b → cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]^T. Let me factor out b:

b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

We can set b = 1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the norm.

|v|^2 = [ cot(theta/2) ]^2 + [1]^2 = (cos^2(theta/2) / sin^2(theta/2)) ) + 1 = [ cos^2 + sin^2 ] / sin^2 → (1) / sin^2(theta/2) )

So the norm is 1/sin(theta/2).

So to normalize, the vector becomes:

v = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] / (1/sin(theta/2)) ) → [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait let me compute it properly.

Wait the norm is sqrt( [cot(theta/2)]^2 + 1 ) = sqrt( (cos^2(theta/2)/sin^2(theta/2)) + 1 ) ) = sqrt( (cos^2 + sin^2) / sin^2 ) ) = sqrt(1/sin^2) ) = 1/sin(theta/2).

So the unit vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] * sin(theta/2) → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because:

cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

Similarly, 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is the angle in the x-z plane, so for example, in terms of spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta would be measured from the z-axis.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Because I sometimes get confused with spin-1/2 systems. For spin along a direction (theta, phi), the eigenstates are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0. So the e^{i phi} term becomes 1. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I have here.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the operator might be in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z), so phi is zero. So the eigenvector should have no phase factor, just real numbers. So the eigenvector is real.

Wait, but wait, the options given:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a common form for spherical harmonics, but in this case, if phi is zero, it becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which might not match.

Wait, but wait, in the x-z plane, the direction is defined by polar angle theta, with phi=0. So the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So looking at the options, option C matches.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the option C gives the correct normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the operator is P_vec·n, which for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is in the direction of n.

In the standard basis, the eigenstates for spin in direction (theta, phi) are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in our problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so phi=0. So the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct answer should be option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But in the options, are they multiplied by anything else, like ħ?

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Hmm, but that doesn't involve theta, so probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

That's similar to the spherical harmonics but with theta instead of theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Exactly what I derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, this has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) as coefficients, multiplied by cos and sin of theta/2. That might look like a normalized vector with those coefficients, but why are there sqrt terms?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization step. Let me recheck.

When I set the vector as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2), 1], then the norm is sqrt( (cot^2(theta/2) +1) ) = csc(theta/2).

So to normalize, I multiply by sin(theta/2):

v = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Which is exactly option C.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (P_x, P_y, P_z)$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute. Thus, $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we get:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]
where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

From the second equation:
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$ into this equation confirms that it is consistent with the first equation. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{\cos^2(\theta/2)}{\sin^2(\theta/2)} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta/2)}} = \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}.
\]
To normalize, multiply by $\sin(\theta/2)$:
\[
|v\rangle = \sin(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not involve $\theta$, so it is incorrect.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is not normalized for spin-1/2 systems and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary coefficients and is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says the operator is P_vec, which is a vector operator made up of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for this operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So that means the vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So any direction in x-z would have angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe φ isn't fixed. But for the eigenvector, maybe I don't need to worry about φ because the operator is along n and we're looking for eigenstates.

Wait, no. The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me write down the matrices for each component.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the matrices, let's compute that.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So,

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying those matrices:

First term (from sinθ):
[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Second term (from cosθ):
[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now I need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let's write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) * [a; b]

Wait no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

(ħ/2) * M * v = (ħ/2) * v

Where M is the matrix [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So I can divide both sides by (ħ/2), getting:

M v = v

So (M - I) v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the matrix equation:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] * [a; b] = [0; 0]

So the equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These are two equations.

Let me write them:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for a and b. Let me first write equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Wait, because (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ), so (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ).

So equation 1: -(1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Alternatively, since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), the ratio becomes [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ] = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

Wait, but let me think in terms of variables. Let me take b as a parameter, say b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), then a = [sinθ / (1 - cosθ)].

Alternatively, I can substitute a in equation 2 and see if it's consistent.

So equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substitute a from equation 1:

sinθ [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) b ] + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Compute this:

[ sin²θ / (1 - cosθ) ) + (-cosθ -1) ] b = 0

Factor out b:

[ sin²θ/(1 - cosθ) - (cosθ +1) ] = 0

Hmm, let's compute this expression:

We know that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, so:

[ (1 - cos²θ)/(1 - cosθ) ) - (cosθ +1) ]

Simplify (1 - cos²θ) = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ), so the numerator becomes (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ), denominator (1 - cosθ) → (1 + cosθ).

So the expression becomes:

(1 + cosθ) - (cosθ +1) = 0. So it's zero. So equation 2 is automatically satisfied given equation 1. So any solution from equation 1 would satisfy equation 2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] where a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

But let's express a in terms of b. Let me express 1 - cosθ as 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ as 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b → [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b → cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]^T. Let me factor out b:

b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

We can set b = 1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the norm.

|v|^2 = [ cot(theta/2) ]^2 + [1]^2 = (cos^2(theta/2) / sin^2(theta/2)) ) + 1 = [ cos^2 + sin^2 ] / sin^2 → (1) / sin^2(theta/2) )

So the norm is 1/sin(theta/2).

So to normalize, the vector becomes:

v = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] / (1/sin(theta/2)) ) → [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait let me compute it properly.

Wait the norm is sqrt( [cot(theta/2)]^2 + 1 ) = sqrt( (cos^2(theta/2)/sin^2(theta/2)) + 1 ) ) = sqrt( (cos^2 + sin^2) / sin^2 ) ) = sqrt(1/sin^2) ) = 1/sin(theta/2).

So the unit vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] * sin(theta/2) → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because:

cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

Similarly, 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is the angle in the x-z plane, so for example, in terms of spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta would be measured from the z-axis.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Because I sometimes get confused with spin-1/2 systems. For spin along a direction (theta, phi), the eigenstates are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0. So the e^{i phi} term becomes 1. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I have here.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the operator might be in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z), so phi is zero. So the eigenvector should have no phase factor, just real numbers. So the eigenvector is real.

Wait, but wait, the options given:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a common form for spherical harmonics, but in this case, if phi is zero, it becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which might not match.

Wait, but wait, in the x-z plane, the direction is defined by polar angle theta, with phi=0. So the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So looking at the options, option C matches.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the option C gives the correct normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the operator is P_vec·n, which for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is in the direction of n.

In the standard basis, the eigenstates for spin in direction (theta, phi) are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in our problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so phi=0. So the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct answer should be option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But in the options, are they multiplied by anything else, like ħ?

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Hmm, but that doesn't involve theta, so probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

That's similar to the spherical harmonics but with theta instead of theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Exactly what I derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, this has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) as coefficients, multiplied by cos and sin of theta/2. That might look like a normalized vector with those coefficients, but why are there sqrt terms?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization step. Let me recheck.

When I set the vector as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2), 1], then the norm is sqrt( (cot^2(theta/2) +1) ) = csc(theta/2).

So to normalize, I multiply by sin(theta/2):

v = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Which is exactly option C.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (P_x, P_y, P_z)$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute. Thus, $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we get:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]
where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

From the second equation:
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$ into this equation confirms that it is consistent with the first equation. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{\cos^2(\theta/2)}{\sin^2(\theta/2)} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta/2)}} = \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}.
\]
To normalize, multiply by $\sin(\theta/2)$:
\[
|v\rangle = \sin(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not involve $\theta$, so it is incorrect.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is not normalized for spin-1/2 systems and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary coefficients and is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
