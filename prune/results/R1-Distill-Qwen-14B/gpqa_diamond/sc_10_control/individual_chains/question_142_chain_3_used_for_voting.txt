Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are vectors in 3D space, which I think relates to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, what's the Bloch sphere again? Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on a sphere in 3D space. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be written in terms of these. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of such projectors.

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, this looks like a completely mixed state. Because each of |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, their projectors are being averaged with equal weights. So this would mean that the state is a statistical mixture of the two basis states, each with 50% probability.

Now, how does this translate into the Bloch sphere? Well, the Bloch vector for a pure state |0⟩ is (0,0,1), right? And for |1⟩, it's (0,0,-1), because |1⟩ is the spin-down state. But wait, the density matrix given is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities. So each has a weight of 1/2.

The density matrix for a mixed state can be written as ρ = p |0⟩⟨0| + (1-p) |1⟩⟨1|. In this case, p is 1/2. I think the Bloch vector for such a mixed state would be the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of the individual states. So for each state, their Bloch vectors are (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1).

Calculating the average: ( (1/2)(0,0,1) ) + ( (1/2)(0,0,-1) ) = (0,0, (1/2 -1/2)) = (0,0,0). So the Bloch vector is at the origin. That would correspond to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches this conclusion. The other options don't fit. Option B is (0,0,1), which is |0⟩, a pure state. Option D is (1,1,1), which doesn't make sense in the Bloch sphere because the length would be sqrt(3), but the Bloch vector should have length ≤1. Option A is (1,1,0), which would be a vector pointing in the x-y plane, maybe a superposition state, but not the mixed state we have here.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. This state is a statistical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\).

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) correspond to the Bloch vectors \((0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. For a mixed state, the Bloch vector is the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of the individual states. Here, the weights are \(1/2\) for both \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Thus, the Bloch vector is:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(0,0,1) + \frac{1}{2}(0,0,-1) = (0,0,0).
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, only option C, \(r = (0,0,0)\), matches this conclusion. The other options are inconsistent with the description of the density matrix:

- Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) corresponds to a superposition state, not a mixed state.
- Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).
- Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) is not valid, as Bloch vectors must have a length of at most 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. This state is a statistical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\).

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) correspond to the Bloch vectors \((0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. For a mixed state, the Bloch vector is the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of the individual states. Here, the weights are \(1/2\) for both \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Thus, the Bloch vector is:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(0,0,1) + \frac{1}{2}(0,0,-1) = (0,0,0).
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, only option C, \(r = (0,0,0)\), matches this conclusion. The other options are inconsistent with the description of the density matrix:

- Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) corresponds to a superposition state, not a mixed state.
- Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).
- Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) is not valid, as Bloch vectors must have a length of at most 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
