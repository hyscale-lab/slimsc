Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain reaction. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, pi is a pion, mu is a muon, and nu is a neutrino. And the pion is at rest initially. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, I don't see the neutrino's mass here. Oh wait, I remember that neutrinos are almost massless, so their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So I can probably ignore it in calculations.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products should be zero as well, because momentum is conserved. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before the reaction is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the reaction, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy will just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. Wait, no, the neutrino's energy is equal to its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. So, the muon's total energy is (105.7 + K_mu) and the neutrino's is K_nu.

So total energy after is (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But also, because of momentum conservation, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum and also the neutrino's momentum.

Now, using the energy-momentum relation for each particle. For the muon, E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2. Similarly, for the neutrino, E_nu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_nu c^2)^2. But since m_nu is almost zero, E_nu ≈ p c.

Wait, but since neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p c. So E_nu = p c. And for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ). But wait, I'm working in units where c=1, so maybe I can ignore the c's for simplification.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

And E_nu = p MeV (since E_nu = p c, and c=1 in these units, so E_nu = p * 1 = p).

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6 MeV.

I can set up the equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me denote x = p. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x. Let's rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute (105.7)^2 and (139.6)^2.

105.7^2 = approx 11172.49 (because 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140 → 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49).

139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Bring 19488.16 to the left:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -2*139.6 x.

Calculate 11172.49 - 19488.16 = -8315.67.

So,

-8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that: 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So maybe 29.8 is too high. Let's see:

279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 * (30 -0.2) = 279.2 *30 =8376, minus 279.2*0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. Hmm, that's very close to 8315.67. So x ≈29.8 - a little less.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16. But our numerator is 8315.67. So 8320.16 is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So, 29.8 *279.2 =8320.16.

We need 8315.67, which is 4.49 less.

So, how much would 279.2 * (29.8 - delta) = 8315.67.

Let me compute delta: 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So delta is approximately 0.016. So x ≈ 29.8 -0.016 ≈29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because 8315.67 /279.2 = approximately 29.78? Let me compute 279.2 *29.78:

279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 - 279.2 = 8376 -279.2 =8096.8.

279.2 *0.78 = let's see: 279.2 *0.7=195.44; 279.2 *0.08=22.336. So total 195.44+22.336=217.776.

So 279.2 *29.78 =8096.8 +217.776=8314.576.

That's very close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8314.576=1.094. So to cover that, how much more do we need?

Each 0.001 increment in x adds 279.2 *0.001=0.2792 to the product.

So 1.094 /0.2792 ≈ 3.916. So x≈29.78 +0.003916 ≈29.7839.

So x≈29.784 MeV/c.

So p≈29.784. 

Now, knowing p, let's find E_mu and E_nu.

E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.784 squared: appr 29.784^2. Let's compute 30^2=900, but 29.784 is 0.216 less than 30. So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2. 2*30=60, 60*0.216=12.96. So 900 -12.96=887.04 plus 0.046656. So 887.086656.

Then, 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So p^2 + m_mu^2 = 887.086656 + 11172.49 ≈ 12059.576656.

Take sqrt: sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.815 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.815 MeV.

But E_mu is m_mu + K_mu. Wait, m_mu is 105.7. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck that. E_mu is the total energy, which is rest mass plus kinetic energy. So yes, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

So K_mu ≈4.115 MeV.

And E_nu is p =29.784 MeV. Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy. So K_nu ≈29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.115 MeV and 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculation steps again for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, when I computed the energies, I assumed that E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), which is correct in units where c=1.

So E_mu = ~109.815 MeV.

Then K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV. So around 4.12 MeV.

E_nu is p, which is ~29.784 MeV, so K_nu is about 29.8 MeV.

So the KEs are about 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Yes, that's the correct one.

So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to have negligible rest mass.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before the reaction is the rest energy of the pion, \(E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the reaction, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's total energy is \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu}c^2 + K_{\mu}\), where \(K_{\mu}\) is its kinetic energy. The neutrino's total energy is approximately \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\), since its rest mass is negligible.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the muon, the energy-momentum relation is:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies
Let \(p\) denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum (equal to the neutrino's momentum). Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) and \(E_{\nu} = p\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Substituting \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2\) and solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2(139.6)}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. For the muon:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (29.784)^2 = 887.086, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.086 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.576} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. For the neutrino:
   \[
   K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain reaction. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, pi is a pion, mu is a muon, and nu is a neutrino. And the pion is at rest initially. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, I don't see the neutrino's mass here. Oh wait, I remember that neutrinos are almost massless, so their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So I can probably ignore it in calculations.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products should be zero as well, because momentum is conserved. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before the reaction is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the reaction, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy will just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. Wait, no, the neutrino's energy is equal to its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. So, the muon's total energy is (105.7 + K_mu) and the neutrino's is K_nu.

So total energy after is (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But also, because of momentum conservation, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum and also the neutrino's momentum.

Now, using the energy-momentum relation for each particle. For the muon, E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2. Similarly, for the neutrino, E_nu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_nu c^2)^2. But since m_nu is almost zero, E_nu ≈ p c.

Wait, but since neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p c. So E_nu = p c. And for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ). But wait, I'm working in units where c=1, so maybe I can ignore the c's for simplification.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

And E_nu = p MeV (since E_nu = p c, and c=1 in these units, so E_nu = p * 1 = p).

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6 MeV.

I can set up the equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me denote x = p. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x. Let's rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute (105.7)^2 and (139.6)^2.

105.7^2 = approx 11172.49 (because 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140 → 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49).

139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Bring 19488.16 to the left:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -2*139.6 x.

Calculate 11172.49 - 19488.16 = -8315.67.

So,

-8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that: 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So maybe 29.8 is too high. Let's see:

279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 * (30 -0.2) = 279.2 *30 =8376, minus 279.2*0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. Hmm, that's very close to 8315.67. So x ≈29.8 - a little less.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16. But our numerator is 8315.67. So 8320.16 is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So, 29.8 *279.2 =8320.16.

We need 8315.67, which is 4.49 less.

So, how much would 279.2 * (29.8 - delta) = 8315.67.

Let me compute delta: 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So delta is approximately 0.016. So x ≈ 29.8 -0.016 ≈29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because 8315.67 /279.2 = approximately 29.78? Let me compute 279.2 *29.78:

279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 - 279.2 = 8376 -279.2 =8096.8.

279.2 *0.78 = let's see: 279.2 *0.7=195.44; 279.2 *0.08=22.336. So total 195.44+22.336=217.776.

So 279.2 *29.78 =8096.8 +217.776=8314.576.

That's very close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8314.576=1.094. So to cover that, how much more do we need?

Each 0.001 increment in x adds 279.2 *0.001=0.2792 to the product.

So 1.094 /0.2792 ≈ 3.916. So x≈29.78 +0.003916 ≈29.7839.

So x≈29.784 MeV/c.

So p≈29.784. 

Now, knowing p, let's find E_mu and E_nu.

E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.784 squared: appr 29.784^2. Let's compute 30^2=900, but 29.784 is 0.216 less than 30. So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2. 2*30=60, 60*0.216=12.96. So 900 -12.96=887.04 plus 0.046656. So 887.086656.

Then, 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So p^2 + m_mu^2 = 887.086656 + 11172.49 ≈ 12059.576656.

Take sqrt: sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.815 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.815 MeV.

But E_mu is m_mu + K_mu. Wait, m_mu is 105.7. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck that. E_mu is the total energy, which is rest mass plus kinetic energy. So yes, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

So K_mu ≈4.115 MeV.

And E_nu is p =29.784 MeV. Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy. So K_nu ≈29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.115 MeV and 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculation steps again for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, when I computed the energies, I assumed that E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), which is correct in units where c=1.

So E_mu = ~109.815 MeV.

Then K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV. So around 4.12 MeV.

E_nu is p, which is ~29.784 MeV, so K_nu is about 29.8 MeV.

So the KEs are about 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Yes, that's the correct one.

So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to have negligible rest mass.

### Conservation Laws

   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's total energy is \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu}c^2 + K_{\mu}\), where \(K_{\mu}\) is its kinetic energy. The neutrino's total energy is approximately \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\), since its rest mass is negligible.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the muon, the energy-momentum relation is:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies
Let \(p\) denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum (equal to the neutrino's momentum). Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) and \(E_{\nu} = p\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Substituting \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2\) and solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2(139.6)}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. For the muon:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (29.784)^2 = 887.086, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.086 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.576} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. For the neutrino:
   \[
   K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
