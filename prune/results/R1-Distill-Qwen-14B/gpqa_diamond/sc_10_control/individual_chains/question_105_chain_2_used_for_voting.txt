Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations due to spots compare to those caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same light curve variation as the star's spots.

Hmm, let's parse the details. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The effective temperature Teff is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh, but wait, the star is spherical, so it's 20% of half the star's surface? Or 20% of the hemisphere. Let me think. The star's surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere is spotty, that's 2πR² area. Filling factor is 20% of that, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star? Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think that means that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR² is the area of the spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are cooler. So the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K, right? Because 6000-1000=5000.

Photometric time-series observations show brightness variations due to rotation—so as the star spins, the spots come into and go out of view, causing dips in brightness. But wait, the problem says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet's effect. So the idea is that both spots on the star and an exoplanet passing in front (transit) would cause dips in brightness, and the question is about the amplitude of these dips.

The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variations, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius? So they want Rplanet/Rstar.

I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets causes a dip in brightness proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the depth of the transit is (Rplanet / Rstar)^2, assuming the planet blocks some of the star's light.

But in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. How do the spots affect the brightness? So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Each spot is cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total brightness observed is less.

Wait, but the star's total brightness is the sum of the flux from all parts of the surface. So when a spot is visible, it contributes less flux than the surrounding areas.

The star's total flux without any spots is L = 4πR² σ Teff⁴. When there are spots, the flux is L = (1 - f) * L + f * L_spot, where f is the filling factor. L_spot is the flux from the spotted regions.

Wait, let me think again. The flux from the spots is lower. So the total flux when considering spots is: L_total = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

Where L_normal is the flux per unit area for the star's normal surface, and L_spot is the flux per unit area for the spots.

So L_normal = σ Teff^4, since flux per unit area is σ T^4.

The spots have a temperature of 5000 K. So L_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So L_total = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

But wait, the filling factor f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Here, f is 0.2 (20%) of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the entire star's surface. Because the entire star's surface is 1 (100%), one hemisphere is 0.5. So 20% of that is 0.1. So f=0.1.

Wait, let me confirm. If the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface area. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the total star's surface area. So f = 0.1.

So L_total = (1 - 0.1) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So when the spots are on the far side (not visible), the observed flux is L = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ Teff^4 = σ Teff^4. Because when not visible, the spots aren't contributing. So the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (but actually, if the star is rotating, when the spots are on the back side, the observer sees no spots, so the maximum flux is when the unspotted areas are all visible).

When the spots are on the front (visible), flux is L_total = 0.9 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but no. The star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as the star spins. So the variation comes from the spots moving in and out of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the filling factor is 0.1 of the entire star's surface. So when the star rotates, the fraction of the surface that's visible with spots would vary. But perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the brightness, and when it's the other hemisphere, the spots are on the back, so their effect is not seen.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, and the brightness is lower. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so their effect is not seen. So the variation in brightness is due to the rotation, as the spotted hemisphere comes and goes from view.

But wait, the star's rotation period would determine the timescale of the brightness variation. But perhaps the main point is to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then compare it to the amplitude caused by a planet transit, and set them equal.

So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which corresponds to when the spots are fully visible (minimum flux) and when they are not (maximum flux).

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (so all spots are visible), the flux is F_min = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_max = L_normal.

So the amplitude (delta F) is F_max - F_min.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star is such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, then the flux is F = (1-f) * L_normal + f * L_spot. Because the entire spotted area is visible.

But when the opposite hemisphere is facing us, then all the spots are on the back and not visible. So F = (1 - f) * L_normal * (since the unspotted part is 1-f) + 0 * f. Wait, no. No, wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area is on the other side—so the flux we receive is only from the unspotted part, which is (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_normal? No, because the other hemisphere isn't spotted. Oh, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (f fraction of one hemisphere) and one without. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = L_normal (since all parts are unspotted? Because the other hemisphere isn't spotty). Wait, no. Wait, no, because the star's other hemisphere is entirely unspotted. So when that is facing us, the flux is F = (1 - f) * L_normal, because the spots are on the other side. But wait, no. Because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, all the spots are on the back, so the flux is entirely from the unspotted regions, which are 1 - f fraction of the entire star's surface. So F_unspotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_normal? No, because the unspotted hemisphere's area is 0.5 * 4π R², and the spots are on the other hemisphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is observed, the spot areas are on the far side and don't contribute.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux as a function of time. At any time, the fraction of the star's surface visible is either the spotted hemisphere or the unspotted. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = (1 - f) * L_normal.

Wait, no. Because the unspotted hemisphere is entirely unspotted. So when that hemisphere is visible, the spots are on the opposite side, so the observed flux is from the unspotted hemisphere. But the unspotted hemisphere's area is 0.5 * 4π R², and the spotted is 0.5 * 4π R². So when the unspotted is visible, the flux is:

F_unspotted = (0.5 * 4π R²) * (σ Teff^4) / (4π R²) ) * (1) + (0.5 * 4π R²) * (σ Teff^4) / (4π R²) ) * (0).

Wait, no, perhaps that's complicating it. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R² / (4π R²) ) = σ Teff^4. But then when a fraction f of the surface is cooler, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4π R². The spots cover f * 4π R², but since they're only on one hemisphere, perhaps f is 0.1 as we determined.

Wait, the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

Because the unspotted area contributes (1-f) * σ Teff^4, and the spotted area contributes f * σ (5000)^4.

When the spots are not visible (the other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is just F = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ Teff^4 = (1 - f + f) * σ Teff^4 = σ Teff^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the spots are not visible, the entire surface we see is unspotted, so the flux is F = σ Teff^4.

So the flux when spots are visible is F_spotted = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (5000)^4.

And when spots are not visible, F_unspotted = σ Teff^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So delta_F = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Which is delta_F = σ Teff^4 - [ (1 - f) σ Teff^4 + f σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 ].

Let me compute this delta_F.

Compute F_unspotted: F0 = σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = (1 - 0.1) * F0 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

So delta_F = F0 - [0.9 F0 + 0.1 σ (5000)^4 ].

delta_F = F0 - 0.9 F0 - 0.1 σ (5000)^4.

= 0.1 F0 - 0.1 σ (5000)^4.

Factor out 0.1 σ:

= 0.1 σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

So the relative change in flux is delta_F / F0.

Because the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F_spotted, so the amplitude is delta_F / F0.

So (delta_F / F0) = [0.1 σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (σ 6000^4 )

The σ cancels out.

= 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4. Let me compute the ratio.

Compute 5000/6000 =5/6. So 5000^4 = (5/6)^4 *6000^4.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4=625, 6^4=1296.

So (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So (delta_F / F0) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

So approximately 5.18% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotted, which is less. So the variation in brightness is F0 - F_spotted. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0, which is 5.18% as computed.

Now, the question is comparing this to an exoplanet transit. For a planet of radius Rp, the transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and this should equal the brightness variation 5.18%.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Take the square root:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ sqrt(0.051775).

Let me compute sqrt(0.051775).

I know that 0.05 is approx (0.2236)^2, since 0.2236^2 = 0.05.

Wait, 0.2236 squared is 0.05.

Let me compute 0.051775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.051775). Let's approximate.

We can write 0.051775 = 0.05 * (1.0355).

Because 0.05 * 1.0355 = 0.051775.

So sqrt(0.051775) = sqrt(0.05) * sqrt(1.0355).

sqrt(0.05) is approximately 0.2236.

sqrt(1.0355) ≈ 1.0176.

So 0.2236 * 1.0176 ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, 0.2236 * 1.0176:

0.2236 *1 = 0.2236.

0.2236 *0.0176 ≈ 0.00394.

So total ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D) ~0.32

Option A) ~0.39

Option C) ~0.11

Option B) ~0.07.

Hmm, 0.23 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the filling factor. Let's go back.

Filling factor f is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R². But the entire star's surface is 4 pi R², so the fraction is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.4/4 = 0.1. So f=0.1.

So that part was correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the star is rotating, the spots are only partially visible. So the maximum and minimum fluxes are not as I calculated. Wait, no. When the star is rotating, the entire spotted hemisphere comes into view. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the brightness variation. Let me think again. When the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are on the near side, so the total flux is:

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

But F_spot is per unit area. So F_spot = (T_spot / T_eff)^4 * F0.

So F_spotted = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ) * F0.

So the amplitude, which is the difference between F_unspotted (F0) and F_spotted, is:

delta_F = F0 - [ (1-f) + f (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ] F0.

= [1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ] F0.

= [f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ] F0.

So, delta_F / F0 = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ].

Which is what I computed earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this in terms of the flux ratio.

Let me compute 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 ≈ 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, so 5.1775% dip.

Which matches what I had earlier.

So, transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.228.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Wait, none of these are about 0.23. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K.

But wait, is the spot temperature 6000 - 1000 =5000 K? Or is it the other way around? Because sometimes spots are hotter, but in reality, they're cooler. So yes, 5000 K is correct.

Wait another thing: the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So, perhaps the brightness variation is similar in amplitude, but the exoplanet would cause a dip when it transits, while the star's spots cause a dip when they are on the near side.

But perhaps the maximum dip due to the planet is when the planet is in front. But perhaps in this problem, the star's brightness variation is caused by spots on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible. So the dip is 5.1775%, as I calculated.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have 0.23. The closest is option D) ~0.32, which is about 0.32. 0.23 is a third of that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the filling factor. Let me double-check. The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². The total surface area is 4 pi R². So the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1. So f=0.1.

So that part is correct.

Wait, what if the spots are on both hemispheres? No, the problem says one hemisphere is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star is so covered with spots that the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But perhaps the maximum and minimum brightnesses are not as straightforward.

Wait, another approach: the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us. The minimum brightness is when the spotted side is facing us. So the variation is the difference between these two.

Wait, perhaps when the star is rotating, the spots are only partially visible, so the brightness variation is smaller. But if the entire hemisphere is spotty, then when it's facing us, the entire spot area is visible. So that's the minimum. The maximum is when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is unspotted.

So our calculation of a 5.17% dip seems correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the exact value. Let me compute the exact value of (5000/6000)^4.

5000^4 = (5^4) * (10^3)^4 = 625 * 10^12 = 6.25e14.

Wait, no, 5000^4 is (5 * 10^3)^4 = 5^4 *10^12 = 625 *10^12 =6.25e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6^4) *1e12 = 1296 *1e12= 1.296e15.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (6.25e14) / (1.296e15) )= 6.25 / 129.6 ≈0.048225.

Wait, wait, no, 6.25e14 /1.296e15 = (6.25 / 1296) * 1e(14-15+something). Wait, no, 6.25e14 divided by 1.296e15 equals (6.25 / 1296) * (1e14 / 1e15) ) = (6.25/1296) * 0.1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 5000^4 / 6000^4.

= (5^4)/(6^4) ) = (625)/(1296) ≈0.48225.

Wait, 625/1296 = approx 0.48225.

So 1 -0.48225=0.51775.

f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)⁴ ) =0.1 *0.51775=0.051775, as before.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So the planet's transit should cause the same dip. So (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775.

Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275.

But none of the options are close to 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the way I calculated the dip.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots are not only in one hemisphere, but perhaps the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible at any one time is f * (1/2), because one hemisphere is visible at a time.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or 20% of one hemisphere.

Ah, perhaps I got the filling factor wrong. Let me read the question again.

"The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

So, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. But since it's only one hemisphere, the filling factor is 0.2 for that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) ).

But the entire star's surface is 4 pi R². So f = (0.2 * 2 pi R² ) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1.

So f=0.1.

So our previous calculation stands.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is that the brightness variation is not when the entire spotted area is visible, but when only a part is visible. Because when the star is rotating, only a portion of the spotted hemisphere comes into view at any given time. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal function, with the amplitude depending on the size of the spots.

But this is more complicated. Because in reality, the spots are rotating into view as the star spins, so the brightness variation could be more complex. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, they're assuming that when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the dip is maximum, and when it's not, the dip is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the near side, so the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, which is when the flux is F_spotted.

But regardless, assuming that our calculation is correct, and the dip is about 5.17%, which would correspond to a planet with radius about 23% of the star's radius. But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (Rp/R*)^2.

Wait, 5.1775% is 0.051775.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275, which is about 0.23.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in terms of exoplanet relative to the star's radius, but perhaps I should compute it in another way.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the light variation due to the spots as a periodic dip, and the amplitude due to the planet is when it's in front. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the spots is (f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )).

So setting these equal: (Rp/R*)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )

So Rp/R* = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )) ).

Compute this:

f=0.1, (T_spot/Te)=5000/6000=5/6.

So 1 - (5/6)^4 = 0.51775.

f * that is 0.1 * 0.51775=0.051775.

So sqrt(0.051775)=0.2275.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness caused by the spots as being when the spots are only partially visible. So the amplitude would be due to the spots moving into and out of view, not the entire hemisphere.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the maximum brightness variation is when the spot is on the limb (edge) of the star. But that would complicate the calculation, as the area blocked would be the area as seen from Earth, which depends on the star's rotation and the spot's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotational period leads to the spots only being partially visible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 again.

5^4 is 625.

6^4 is 1296.

625/1296 ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 is 0.51775.

So f * that is 0.1 * 0.51775=0.051775.

Which is 5.1775% dip.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is rotating, the spots are not just on the front or back, but their visibility varies continuously. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, but that's a brief period, and the average variation is less. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's light curve would have a smoother variation, but the amplitude is the same as a planet's transit when the entire spot is visible. So the amplitude is the same, so our calculation is correct.

But given that the options don't include 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem.

Wait, the problem says "as only one hemisphere is spotty"—so when it's rotating, perhaps the spots are visible for a certain period, but the brightness variation is similar to a planet's transit.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the maximum dip, but the average variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on one side, so the maximum is as we calculated, but the average dip is less. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement means that the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as that caused by a planet. So perhaps the star's variation is due to the spots being on the near side, causing a dip, and the planet's dip is when it transits.

Thus, the amplitude from the spots is 5.17% dip, so the planet's dip should be the same. So (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775, Rp/R*=0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's variation is caused by the spots being on the side, and the planet's transit is a partial eclipse. But perhaps the way the flux changes is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is not just a step function (spots fully on or off) but a sinusoidal variation as the spot comes into view and then goes away. But in that case, the amplitude calculation might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's variation as a dip only when a certain fraction of the spot is visible, and the planet's transit would have a different effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the spots rotate into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. But in that case, the amplitude would be determined by the size of the spot relative to the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as the spots moving across the star's disk, causing a varying dip. So the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully in front of the star, which is the same as the entire spot area being covered.

In that case, the maximum dip would be the same as our calculation. So the dip is 5.1775% of the star's total flux.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775, so Rp/R*=0.2275.

But again, this isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the 20% is of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Let me reevaluate.

The question states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So f is 0.2.

Wait, wait no. No, because filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is covered with 20% of that hemisphere's surface, then the total filling factor is 20% of 50% of the star's surface, so f=0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Wait, no. Because the star's surface is 4 pi R². One hemisphere is 2 pi R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the total filling factor is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

Thus, our initial calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation when the spots are on the far side as the maximum, but that can't be because the spots are cooler and would cause a dip only when visible.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the same amplitude when the star's brightness variation is due to the spots' rotational modulation. So perhaps the star's brightness variation is a sine wave with an amplitude determined by the spots' coverage. But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the planet's transit dip.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum possible dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is a continuous change as the spots rotate into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The maximum dip is 5.17%, but the average variation might be half that.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the near side, but the planet's transit is a one-time dip. So perhaps the variation in brightness is such that the amplitude is the same for both.

But given that none of the options match 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the flux from the star. Let's re-calculate the dip.

F_unspotted = F0 = σ Teff⁴.

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ (Te_spot)^4.

delta_F = F0 - F_spotted.

= F0 - ( (1-f) F0 + f σ (5000)^4 )

= F0 [ 1 - (1-f) - f (5000^4 / Teff^4) ]

= F0 [ f (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0.

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)) F0.

= 0.1 * ( (1296 -625)/1296 ) F0.

= 0.1 * (671/1296) F0.

671/1296 ≈0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 F0, as before.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275.

Which is about 0.23. But no option is near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star, not the diameter. So perhaps I should double the planet's radius. But no, because R is radius. Wait, no.

Wait, another possibility: the calculation is correct, but the options are presented in a different way. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23. So the closest option is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the planet's transit depth is (Rp/R*)^2, but the star's dip is not (f * (1- (T_spot/Te)^4 )). Maybe the star's dip is (f) * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ). Oh, but no, because the flux is additive.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

So delta_F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = F0 - [ (1-f) F0 + f F_spot ].

= F0 - (1-f) F0 - f F_spot.

= f ( F0 - F_spot )

= f * F0 * (1 - (F_spot/F0)).

F_spot = (T_spot / Te)^4 * F0.

So delta_F = f * F0 * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ).

So the relative change is delta_F / F0 = f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )

=0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 )

=0.1 *0.51775=0.051775.

So same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve, considering the rotational modulation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the star's variation is not a step function but a sinusoidal variation as the spots come into view. So the amplitude would be determined by the size of the spot as a fraction of the star's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is the same as if the spot were a planet transiting. So the dip when the spot is fully in front is the same as the planet's transit dip.

But that's what I've been calculating.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value.

Compute sqrt(0.051775).

What's 0.2275 squared?

0.2275^2 = (0.22)^2 + (0.0075)^2 + 2*0.22*0.0075.

=0.0484 + 0.00005625 + 0.0033 = approx 0.05175625.

Which is very close to 0.051775.

So Rp/R* =0.2275.

So about 0.23.

But perhaps the options are in terms of the planet's size relative to the star but using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is when a certain amount of the star's surface is covered, but the planet's transit is when the planet covers the same area. So the planet's area is (Rp/R*)^2, which equals the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots (f), which is 0.1.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1 → Rp/R* = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is about 0.32.

So that's option D.

But wait, why would (Rp/R*)^2 equal f? Because then the dip would be the same as the spot's filling factor. But that's not correct, because the dip depends on the temperature difference as well.

Hmm, perhaps the question is simplified and assumes that the dip in brightness is directly proportional to the area covered, regardless of the temperature. So if the star's dip is due to 0.1 of its surface being covered (f=0.1), then the planet's dip should have the same f, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.1 → Rp/R*≈0.316, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? Because the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the star is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775.

But if the question is asking for the same amplitude, not the same dip. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775.

The planet's dip is (Rp/R*)^2.

So to have the same amplitude, set (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775.

Which gives Rp/R*=0.2275.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is f, not considering the temperature difference. So f=0.1.

So (Rp/R*)^2 =0.1 → Rp/R*≈0.316, which is option D.

But I'm not sure if that's correct, because the dip from the star is not just f, but also dependent on the temperature of the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same change in brightness, so the star's brightness variation is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775. So the planet's dip must be the same, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of sqrt(0.051775).

Let me compute it precisely.

0.051775.

What's its square root?

We can use an iterative approach. Let me guess that 0.227^2 = 0.051529.

0.227^2 = (0.2 + 0.027)^2 = 0.04 + 2*0.2*0.027 + 0.027^2 = 0.04 + 0.0108 + 0.000729 = 0.051529.

0.228^2 = (0.227 +0.001)^2 =0.051529 + 2*0.227*0.001 +0.001^2= 0.051529 +0.000454 +0.000001= 0.051984.

So 0.228^2=0.051984.

But our target is 0.051775.

So it's between 0.227 and 0.228.

Compute 0.2275^2:

= (0.227 +0.0005)^2 = 0.051529 + 2*0.227*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

= 0.051529 + 0.000227 + 0.00000025.

= 0.05175625.

Which is very close to 0.051775.

So 0.2275^2=0.05175625.

The target is 0.051775.

So difference is 0.051775 -0.05175625 = 0.00001875.

So, how much more than 0.2275 do we need to get an additional 0.00001875 in the square.

The derivative of x^2 at x=0.2275 is 2x=0.455.

So delta_x ≈ delta/(2x) )= 0.00001875 / 0.455 ≈4.12e-5.

So x≈0.2275 +0.0000412=0.2275412.

So approximately 0.2275.

So Rp/R*≈0.2275.

But no option is close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is f * (T_spot/Te)^4, but that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775, and setting that equal to (Rp/R*)^2.

So Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775)=0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is when the spots are on the far side, leading to a higher brightness, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is when the spots are on the near side, but the planet's transit is when the planet is in front, causing a dip. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the star is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 5.1775%.

So to have the same amplitude, set (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775 → Rp/R*≈0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's variation as a maximum of (f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )) multiplied by some factor. But I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute the (5/6)^4 again.

5000/6000=5/6.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225=0.51775.

f=0.1.

0.1 *0.51775=0.051775.

Same as before.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip would be f * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) =0.2 *0.51775=0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

So (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, perhaps that's the mistake. I assumed that f=0.1 because it's 20% of one hemisphere. But perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Let me read the problem again.

Problem statement: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So f is 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 =0.1.

So our initial calculation holds. Thus, the correct Rp/R* is ~0.23, but no option matches.

But perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)=0.11. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dip as f * (T_spot/Te)^4, but that would be 0.1 * (5/6)^4 =0.1 *0.48225=0.048225.

So then (Rp/R*)^2=0.048225 → Rp/R*≈0.2196.

Still, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), but using f=0.2.

So 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.

But why would f be 0.2 then? Because the problem says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering that the spots are on only one hemisphere. Let me think. If the star's spots are on both hemispheres, each with 20% coverage, then the total f would be 0.4. But the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is missing a decimal point, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think in terms of the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side.

Another approach: the star's light curve variation is due to the spots being in view, so the brightness is lower. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

The star's flux when the spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

The flux when the spots are not visible is F0.

So the variation is F0 - F = F0 - [ (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot ] = f (F0 - F_spot).

The relative variation is (F0 - F)/F0 = f (1 - (F_spot/F0)).

F_spot is (T_spot/Te)^4 * F0.

So relative dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ).

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) =0.051775, or 5.1775%.

So the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f. Let me think again.

The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, so f=0.2*(1/2)=0.1.

But perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the star's surface covered as f=0.2, regardless of the hemisphere. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip would be 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.2*0.51775=0.10355, so 10.355% dip.

So (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is option D.

But why would the problem state that the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20% if f is 0.2? Unless the filling factor is 20% of the entire star.

Ah, perhaps the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the star's entire surface, not one hemisphere.

Because the wording is: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface. So the entire star has 20% of its surface covered by spots, which are all on one hemisphere.

Wait, that can't be, because a hemisphere is half the surface. So if all the spots are on one hemisphere, then the filling factor of 20% of the entire star's surface would imply that the spots cover 20% of the entire star, which is 20% of 4 pi R². So the area is 0.2 *4 pi R²= 0.8 pi R².

But since all spots are on one hemisphere (2 pi R² area), the filling factor for that hemisphere is (0.8 pi R²)/(2 pi R²) )= 0.4, or 40%.

So the filling factor of the hemisphere is 40%, not 20% of the entire star.

So the initial calculation was correct.

Hmm.

After all this, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to Rp/R*=0.2275, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32, assuming that f=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation from the spots is when the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The amplitude of this variation is determined by the spot size and temperature.

The maximum dip would be when the entire spot is in front, which is the same as our previous calculation. But perhaps the average dip is less.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a dip of (f) * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775, and the planet's transit is when the area is (Rp/R*)^2, so we set (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as a fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth, not the actual surface area. But that complicates the matter.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)=0.11.

But why? Perhaps I made a mistake and the dip is 0.0121.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.051775, and perhaps the intended answer is the square root of (0.051775/2) → which is approximately 0.1598. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest I can get is option D) 0.32, which would be the case if f=0.2, but according to the problem statement, f should be 0.1.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming that the filling factor is 0.2 of the entire star. But according to the problem statement, it's 20% of one hemisphere, which is f=0.1.

But perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip is 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355.

Rp/R*=sqrt(0.10355)=0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So I think the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same brightness variation in the star's light curve as the observed star with dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (spot temperature = 5000 K). The goal is to compare the amplitude of brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by an exoplanet transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Filling Factor and Spot Coverage**:
   - The filling factor is defined as the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the total filling factor for the entire star is calculated as:
     \[
     f = 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1
     \]
     Thus, the spots cover 10% of the star's total surface area.

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its effective temperature:
     \[
     F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced due to their lower temperature. The flux during the spotted phase is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (1 - f) F_0 + f \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation (relative flux change) is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = f \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
     \]
   - Substituting \(f = 0.1\), \(T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K}\):
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775
     \]
     Thus, the relative brightness variation is approximately \(5.1775\%\).

3. **Exoplanet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F / F_0
     \]
   - Substituting \(\Delta F / F_0 = 0.051775\):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \(R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275\) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **D) ~0.32**, which corresponds to a slightly higher value. This discrepancy may arise if the problem assumes the filling factor \(f\) is 20% of the entire star's surface (i.e., \(f = 0.2\)) rather than one hemisphere.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the potential interpretation of the filling factor, the most reasonable answer is **D) ~0.32**, assuming \(f = 0.2\). This aligns with the problem's intent and the provided choices.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations due to spots compare to those caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same light curve variation as the star's spots.

Hmm, let's parse the details. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The effective temperature Teff is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh, but wait, the star is spherical, so it's 20% of half the star's surface? Or 20% of the hemisphere. Let me think. The star's surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere is spotty, that's 2πR² area. Filling factor is 20% of that, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star? Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think that means that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR² is the area of the spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are cooler. So the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K, right? Because 6000-1000=5000.

Photometric time-series observations show brightness variations due to rotation—so as the star spins, the spots come into and go out of view, causing dips in brightness. But wait, the problem says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet's effect. So the idea is that both spots on the star and an exoplanet passing in front (transit) would cause dips in brightness, and the question is about the amplitude of these dips.

The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variations, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius? So they want Rplanet/Rstar.

I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets causes a dip in brightness proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the depth of the transit is (Rplanet / Rstar)^2, assuming the planet blocks some of the star's light.

But in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. How do the spots affect the brightness? So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Each spot is cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total brightness observed is less.

Wait, but the star's total brightness is the sum of the flux from all parts of the surface. So when a spot is visible, it contributes less flux than the surrounding areas.

The star's total flux without any spots is L = 4πR² σ Teff⁴. When there are spots, the flux is L = (1 - f) * L + f * L_spot, where f is the filling factor. L_spot is the flux from the spotted regions.

Wait, let me think again. The flux from the spots is lower. So the total flux when considering spots is: L_total = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

Where L_normal is the flux per unit area for the star's normal surface, and L_spot is the flux per unit area for the spots.

So L_normal = σ Teff^4, since flux per unit area is σ T^4.

The spots have a temperature of 5000 K. So L_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So L_total = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

But wait, the filling factor f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Here, f is 0.2 (20%) of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the entire star's surface. Because the entire star's surface is 1 (100%), one hemisphere is 0.5. So 20% of that is 0.1. So f=0.1.

Wait, let me confirm. If the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface area. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the total star's surface area. So f = 0.1.

So L_total = (1 - 0.1) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So when the spots are on the far side (not visible), the observed flux is L = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ Teff^4 = σ Teff^4. Because when not visible, the spots aren't contributing. So the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (but actually, if the star is rotating, when the spots are on the back side, the observer sees no spots, so the maximum flux is when the unspotted areas are all visible).

When the spots are on the front (visible), flux is L_total = 0.9 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but no. The star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as the star spins. So the variation comes from the spots moving in and out of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the filling factor is 0.1 of the entire star's surface. So when the star rotates, the fraction of the surface that's visible with spots would vary. But perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the brightness, and when it's the other hemisphere, the spots are on the back, so their effect is not seen.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, and the brightness is lower. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so their effect is not seen. So the variation in brightness is due to the rotation, as the spotted hemisphere comes and goes from view.

But wait, the star's rotation period would determine the timescale of the brightness variation. But perhaps the main point is to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then compare it to the amplitude caused by a planet transit, and set them equal.

So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which corresponds to when the spots are fully visible (minimum flux) and when they are not (maximum flux).

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (so all spots are visible), the flux is F_min = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_max = L_normal.

So the amplitude (delta F) is F_max - F_min.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star is such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, then the flux is F = (1-f) * L_normal + f * L_spot. Because the entire spotted area is visible.

But when the opposite hemisphere is facing us, then all the spots are on the back and not visible. So F = (1 - f) * L_normal * (since the unspotted part is 1-f) + 0 * f. Wait, no. No, wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area is on the other side—so the flux we receive is only from the unspotted part, which is (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_normal? No, because the other hemisphere isn't spotted. Oh, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (f fraction of one hemisphere) and one without. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = L_normal (since all parts are unspotted? Because the other hemisphere isn't spotty). Wait, no. Wait, no, because the star's other hemisphere is entirely unspotted. So when that is facing us, the flux is F = (1 - f) * L_normal, because the spots are on the other side. But wait, no. Because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, all the spots are on the back, so the flux is entirely from the unspotted regions, which are 1 - f fraction of the entire star's surface. So F_unspotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_normal? No, because the unspotted hemisphere's area is 0.5 * 4π R², and the spots are on the other hemisphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is observed, the spot areas are on the far side and don't contribute.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux as a function of time. At any time, the fraction of the star's surface visible is either the spotted hemisphere or the unspotted. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = (1 - f) * L_normal.

Wait, no. Because the unspotted hemisphere is entirely unspotted. So when that hemisphere is visible, the spots are on the opposite side, so the observed flux is from the unspotted hemisphere. But the unspotted hemisphere's area is 0.5 * 4π R², and the spotted is 0.5 * 4π R². So when the unspotted is visible, the flux is:

F_unspotted = (0.5 * 4π R²) * (σ Teff^4) / (4π R²) ) * (1) + (0.5 * 4π R²) * (σ Teff^4) / (4π R²) ) * (0).

Wait, no, perhaps that's complicating it. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R² / (4π R²) ) = σ Teff^4. But then when a fraction f of the surface is cooler, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4π R². The spots cover f * 4π R², but since they're only on one hemisphere, perhaps f is 0.1 as we determined.

Wait, the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

Because the unspotted area contributes (1-f) * σ Teff^4, and the spotted area contributes f * σ (5000)^4.

When the spots are not visible (the other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is just F = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ Teff^4 = (1 - f + f) * σ Teff^4 = σ Teff^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the spots are not visible, the entire surface we see is unspotted, so the flux is F = σ Teff^4.

So the flux when spots are visible is F_spotted = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (5000)^4.

And when spots are not visible, F_unspotted = σ Teff^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So delta_F = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Which is delta_F = σ Teff^4 - [ (1 - f) σ Teff^4 + f σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 ].

Let me compute this delta_F.

Compute F_unspotted: F0 = σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = (1 - 0.1) * F0 + 0.1 * σ (5000)^4.

So delta_F = F0 - [0.9 F0 + 0.1 σ (5000)^4 ].

delta_F = F0 - 0.9 F0 - 0.1 σ (5000)^4.

= 0.1 F0 - 0.1 σ (5000)^4.

Factor out 0.1 σ:

= 0.1 σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

So the relative change in flux is delta_F / F0.

Because the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F_spotted, so the amplitude is delta_F / F0.

So (delta_F / F0) = [0.1 σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (σ 6000^4 )

The σ cancels out.

= 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4. Let me compute the ratio.

Compute 5000/6000 =5/6. So 5000^4 = (5/6)^4 *6000^4.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4=625, 6^4=1296.

So (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So (delta_F / F0) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

So approximately 5.18% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotted, which is less. So the variation in brightness is F0 - F_spotted. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0, which is 5.18% as computed.

Now, the question is comparing this to an exoplanet transit. For a planet of radius Rp, the transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and this should equal the brightness variation 5.18%.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Take the square root:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ sqrt(0.051775).

Let me compute sqrt(0.051775).

I know that 0.05 is approx (0.2236)^2, since 0.2236^2 = 0.05.

Wait, 0.2236 squared is 0.05.

Let me compute 0.051775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.051775). Let's approximate.

We can write 0.051775 = 0.05 * (1.0355).

Because 0.05 * 1.0355 = 0.051775.

So sqrt(0.051775) = sqrt(0.05) * sqrt(1.0355).

sqrt(0.05) is approximately 0.2236.

sqrt(1.0355) ≈ 1.0176.

So 0.2236 * 1.0176 ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, 0.2236 * 1.0176:

0.2236 *1 = 0.2236.

0.2236 *0.0176 ≈ 0.00394.

So total ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D) ~0.32

Option A) ~0.39

Option C) ~0.11

Option B) ~0.07.

Hmm, 0.23 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the filling factor. Let's go back.

Filling factor f is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R². But the entire star's surface is 4 pi R², so the fraction is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.4/4 = 0.1. So f=0.1.

So that part was correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the star is rotating, the spots are only partially visible. So the maximum and minimum fluxes are not as I calculated. Wait, no. When the star is rotating, the entire spotted hemisphere comes into view. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the brightness variation. Let me think again. When the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are on the near side, so the total flux is:

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

But F_spot is per unit area. So F_spot = (T_spot / T_eff)^4 * F0.

So F_spotted = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ) * F0.

So the amplitude, which is the difference between F_unspotted (F0) and F_spotted, is:

delta_F = F0 - [ (1-f) + f (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ] F0.

= [1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ] F0.

= [f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ] F0.

So, delta_F / F0 = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ].

Which is what I computed earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this in terms of the flux ratio.

Let me compute 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 ≈ 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, so 5.1775% dip.

Which matches what I had earlier.

So, transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.228.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Wait, none of these are about 0.23. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K.

But wait, is the spot temperature 6000 - 1000 =5000 K? Or is it the other way around? Because sometimes spots are hotter, but in reality, they're cooler. So yes, 5000 K is correct.

Wait another thing: the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So, perhaps the brightness variation is similar in amplitude, but the exoplanet would cause a dip when it transits, while the star's spots cause a dip when they are on the near side.

But perhaps the maximum dip due to the planet is when the planet is in front. But perhaps in this problem, the star's brightness variation is caused by spots on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible. So the dip is 5.1775%, as I calculated.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have 0.23. The closest is option D) ~0.32, which is about 0.32. 0.23 is a third of that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the filling factor. Let me double-check. The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². The total surface area is 4 pi R². So the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1. So f=0.1.

So that part is correct.

Wait, what if the spots are on both hemispheres? No, the problem says one hemisphere is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star is so covered with spots that the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But perhaps the maximum and minimum brightnesses are not as straightforward.

Wait, another approach: the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us. The minimum brightness is when the spotted side is facing us. So the variation is the difference between these two.

Wait, perhaps when the star is rotating, the spots are only partially visible, so the brightness variation is smaller. But if the entire hemisphere is spotty, then when it's facing us, the entire spot area is visible. So that's the minimum. The maximum is when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is unspotted.

So our calculation of a 5.17% dip seems correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the exact value. Let me compute the exact value of (5000/6000)^4.

5000^4 = (5^4) * (10^3)^4 = 625 * 10^12 = 6.25e14.

Wait, no, 5000^4 is (5 * 10^3)^4 = 5^4 *10^12 = 625 *10^12 =6.25e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6^4) *1e12 = 1296 *1e12= 1.296e15.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (6.25e14) / (1.296e15) )= 6.25 / 129.6 ≈0.048225.

Wait, wait, no, 6.25e14 /1.296e15 = (6.25 / 1296) * 1e(14-15+something). Wait, no, 6.25e14 divided by 1.296e15 equals (6.25 / 1296) * (1e14 / 1e15) ) = (6.25/1296) * 0.1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 5000^4 / 6000^4.

= (5^4)/(6^4) ) = (625)/(1296) ≈0.48225.

Wait, 625/1296 = approx 0.48225.

So 1 -0.48225=0.51775.

f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)⁴ ) =0.1 *0.51775=0.051775, as before.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So the planet's transit should cause the same dip. So (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775.

Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275.

But none of the options are close to 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the way I calculated the dip.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots are not only in one hemisphere, but perhaps the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible at any one time is f * (1/2), because one hemisphere is visible at a time.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or 20% of one hemisphere.

Ah, perhaps I got the filling factor wrong. Let me read the question again.

"The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

So, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. But since it's only one hemisphere, the filling factor is 0.2 for that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) ).

But the entire star's surface is 4 pi R². So f = (0.2 * 2 pi R² ) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1.

So f=0.1.

So our previous calculation stands.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is that the brightness variation is not when the entire spotted area is visible, but when only a part is visible. Because when the star is rotating, only a portion of the spotted hemisphere comes into view at any given time. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal function, with the amplitude depending on the size of the spots.

But this is more complicated. Because in reality, the spots are rotating into view as the star spins, so the brightness variation could be more complex. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, they're assuming that when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the dip is maximum, and when it's not, the dip is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the near side, so the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, which is when the flux is F_spotted.

But regardless, assuming that our calculation is correct, and the dip is about 5.17%, which would correspond to a planet with radius about 23% of the star's radius. But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (Rp/R*)^2.

Wait, 5.1775% is 0.051775.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275, which is about 0.23.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in terms of exoplanet relative to the star's radius, but perhaps I should compute it in another way.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the light variation due to the spots as a periodic dip, and the amplitude due to the planet is when it's in front. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the spots is (f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )).

So setting these equal: (Rp/R*)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )

So Rp/R* = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )) ).

Compute this:

f=0.1, (T_spot/Te)=5000/6000=5/6.

So 1 - (5/6)^4 = 0.51775.

f * that is 0.1 * 0.51775=0.051775.

So sqrt(0.051775)=0.2275.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness caused by the spots as being when the spots are only partially visible. So the amplitude would be due to the spots moving into and out of view, not the entire hemisphere.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the maximum brightness variation is when the spot is on the limb (edge) of the star. But that would complicate the calculation, as the area blocked would be the area as seen from Earth, which depends on the star's rotation and the spot's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotational period leads to the spots only being partially visible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 again.

5^4 is 625.

6^4 is 1296.

625/1296 ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 is 0.51775.

So f * that is 0.1 * 0.51775=0.051775.

Which is 5.1775% dip.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is rotating, the spots are not just on the front or back, but their visibility varies continuously. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, but that's a brief period, and the average variation is less. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's light curve would have a smoother variation, but the amplitude is the same as a planet's transit when the entire spot is visible. So the amplitude is the same, so our calculation is correct.

But given that the options don't include 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem.

Wait, the problem says "as only one hemisphere is spotty"—so when it's rotating, perhaps the spots are visible for a certain period, but the brightness variation is similar to a planet's transit.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the maximum dip, but the average variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on one side, so the maximum is as we calculated, but the average dip is less. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement means that the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as that caused by a planet. So perhaps the star's variation is due to the spots being on the near side, causing a dip, and the planet's dip is when it transits.

Thus, the amplitude from the spots is 5.17% dip, so the planet's dip should be the same. So (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775, Rp/R*=0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's variation is caused by the spots being on the side, and the planet's transit is a partial eclipse. But perhaps the way the flux changes is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is not just a step function (spots fully on or off) but a sinusoidal variation as the spot comes into view and then goes away. But in that case, the amplitude calculation might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's variation as a dip only when a certain fraction of the spot is visible, and the planet's transit would have a different effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the spots rotate into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. But in that case, the amplitude would be determined by the size of the spot relative to the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as the spots moving across the star's disk, causing a varying dip. So the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully in front of the star, which is the same as the entire spot area being covered.

In that case, the maximum dip would be the same as our calculation. So the dip is 5.1775% of the star's total flux.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775, so Rp/R*=0.2275.

But again, this isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the 20% is of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Let me reevaluate.

The question states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So f is 0.2.

Wait, wait no. No, because filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is covered with 20% of that hemisphere's surface, then the total filling factor is 20% of 50% of the star's surface, so f=0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Wait, no. Because the star's surface is 4 pi R². One hemisphere is 2 pi R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the total filling factor is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

Thus, our initial calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation when the spots are on the far side as the maximum, but that can't be because the spots are cooler and would cause a dip only when visible.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the same amplitude when the star's brightness variation is due to the spots' rotational modulation. So perhaps the star's brightness variation is a sine wave with an amplitude determined by the spots' coverage. But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the planet's transit dip.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum possible dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is a continuous change as the spots rotate into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The maximum dip is 5.17%, but the average variation might be half that.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the near side, but the planet's transit is a one-time dip. So perhaps the variation in brightness is such that the amplitude is the same for both.

But given that none of the options match 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the flux from the star. Let's re-calculate the dip.

F_unspotted = F0 = σ Teff⁴.

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ (Te_spot)^4.

delta_F = F0 - F_spotted.

= F0 - ( (1-f) F0 + f σ (5000)^4 )

= F0 [ 1 - (1-f) - f (5000^4 / Teff^4) ]

= F0 [ f (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0.

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)) F0.

= 0.1 * ( (1296 -625)/1296 ) F0.

= 0.1 * (671/1296) F0.

671/1296 ≈0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 F0, as before.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2275.

Which is about 0.23. But no option is near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star, not the diameter. So perhaps I should double the planet's radius. But no, because R is radius. Wait, no.

Wait, another possibility: the calculation is correct, but the options are presented in a different way. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23. So the closest option is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the planet's transit depth is (Rp/R*)^2, but the star's dip is not (f * (1- (T_spot/Te)^4 )). Maybe the star's dip is (f) * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ). Oh, but no, because the flux is additive.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

So delta_F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = F0 - [ (1-f) F0 + f F_spot ].

= F0 - (1-f) F0 - f F_spot.

= f ( F0 - F_spot )

= f * F0 * (1 - (F_spot/F0)).

F_spot = (T_spot / Te)^4 * F0.

So delta_F = f * F0 * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ).

So the relative change is delta_F / F0 = f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )

=0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 )

=0.1 *0.51775=0.051775.

So same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve, considering the rotational modulation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the star's variation is not a step function but a sinusoidal variation as the spots come into view. So the amplitude would be determined by the size of the spot as a fraction of the star's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is the same as if the spot were a planet transiting. So the dip when the spot is fully in front is the same as the planet's transit dip.

But that's what I've been calculating.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value.

Compute sqrt(0.051775).

What's 0.2275 squared?

0.2275^2 = (0.22)^2 + (0.0075)^2 + 2*0.22*0.0075.

=0.0484 + 0.00005625 + 0.0033 = approx 0.05175625.

Which is very close to 0.051775.

So Rp/R* =0.2275.

So about 0.23.

But perhaps the options are in terms of the planet's size relative to the star but using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is when a certain amount of the star's surface is covered, but the planet's transit is when the planet covers the same area. So the planet's area is (Rp/R*)^2, which equals the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots (f), which is 0.1.

So (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1 → Rp/R* = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is about 0.32.

So that's option D.

But wait, why would (Rp/R*)^2 equal f? Because then the dip would be the same as the spot's filling factor. But that's not correct, because the dip depends on the temperature difference as well.

Hmm, perhaps the question is simplified and assumes that the dip in brightness is directly proportional to the area covered, regardless of the temperature. So if the star's dip is due to 0.1 of its surface being covered (f=0.1), then the planet's dip should have the same f, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.1 → Rp/R*≈0.316, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? Because the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the star is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775.

But if the question is asking for the same amplitude, not the same dip. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775.

The planet's dip is (Rp/R*)^2.

So to have the same amplitude, set (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775.

Which gives Rp/R*=0.2275.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is f, not considering the temperature difference. So f=0.1.

So (Rp/R*)^2 =0.1 → Rp/R*≈0.316, which is option D.

But I'm not sure if that's correct, because the dip from the star is not just f, but also dependent on the temperature of the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same change in brightness, so the star's brightness variation is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775. So the planet's dip must be the same, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of sqrt(0.051775).

Let me compute it precisely.

0.051775.

What's its square root?

We can use an iterative approach. Let me guess that 0.227^2 = 0.051529.

0.227^2 = (0.2 + 0.027)^2 = 0.04 + 2*0.2*0.027 + 0.027^2 = 0.04 + 0.0108 + 0.000729 = 0.051529.

0.228^2 = (0.227 +0.001)^2 =0.051529 + 2*0.227*0.001 +0.001^2= 0.051529 +0.000454 +0.000001= 0.051984.

So 0.228^2=0.051984.

But our target is 0.051775.

So it's between 0.227 and 0.228.

Compute 0.2275^2:

= (0.227 +0.0005)^2 = 0.051529 + 2*0.227*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

= 0.051529 + 0.000227 + 0.00000025.

= 0.05175625.

Which is very close to 0.051775.

So 0.2275^2=0.05175625.

The target is 0.051775.

So difference is 0.051775 -0.05175625 = 0.00001875.

So, how much more than 0.2275 do we need to get an additional 0.00001875 in the square.

The derivative of x^2 at x=0.2275 is 2x=0.455.

So delta_x ≈ delta/(2x) )= 0.00001875 / 0.455 ≈4.12e-5.

So x≈0.2275 +0.0000412=0.2275412.

So approximately 0.2275.

So Rp/R*≈0.2275.

But no option is close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's dip is f * (T_spot/Te)^4, but that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775, and setting that equal to (Rp/R*)^2.

So Rp/R* = sqrt(0.051775)=0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is when the spots are on the far side, leading to a higher brightness, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is when the spots are on the near side, but the planet's transit is when the planet is in front, causing a dip. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/R*)^2, and the dip from the star is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 5.1775%.

So to have the same amplitude, set (Rp/R*)^2 =0.051775 → Rp/R*≈0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's variation as a maximum of (f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 )) multiplied by some factor. But I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute the (5/6)^4 again.

5000/6000=5/6.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225=0.51775.

f=0.1.

0.1 *0.51775=0.051775.

Same as before.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip would be f * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) =0.2 *0.51775=0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

So (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, perhaps that's the mistake. I assumed that f=0.1 because it's 20% of one hemisphere. But perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Let me read the problem again.

Problem statement: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So f is 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 =0.1.

So our initial calculation holds. Thus, the correct Rp/R* is ~0.23, but no option matches.

But perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)=0.11. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dip as f * (T_spot/Te)^4, but that would be 0.1 * (5/6)^4 =0.1 *0.48225=0.048225.

So then (Rp/R*)^2=0.048225 → Rp/R*≈0.2196.

Still, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), but using f=0.2.

So 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.

But why would f be 0.2 then? Because the problem says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering that the spots are on only one hemisphere. Let me think. If the star's spots are on both hemispheres, each with 20% coverage, then the total f would be 0.4. But the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is missing a decimal point, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think in terms of the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side.

Another approach: the star's light curve variation is due to the spots being in view, so the brightness is lower. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

The star's flux when the spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

The flux when the spots are not visible is F0.

So the variation is F0 - F = F0 - [ (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot ] = f (F0 - F_spot).

The relative variation is (F0 - F)/F0 = f (1 - (F_spot/F0)).

F_spot is (T_spot/Te)^4 * F0.

So relative dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ).

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) =0.051775, or 5.1775%.

So the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip, so (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f. Let me think again.

The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, so f=0.2*(1/2)=0.1.

But perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the star's surface covered as f=0.2, regardless of the hemisphere. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip would be 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.2*0.51775=0.10355, so 10.355% dip.

So (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355 → Rp/R*≈0.3218.

Which is option D.

But why would the problem state that the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20% if f is 0.2? Unless the filling factor is 20% of the entire star.

Ah, perhaps the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the star's entire surface, not one hemisphere.

Because the wording is: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface. So the entire star has 20% of its surface covered by spots, which are all on one hemisphere.

Wait, that can't be, because a hemisphere is half the surface. So if all the spots are on one hemisphere, then the filling factor of 20% of the entire star's surface would imply that the spots cover 20% of the entire star, which is 20% of 4 pi R². So the area is 0.2 *4 pi R²= 0.8 pi R².

But since all spots are on one hemisphere (2 pi R² area), the filling factor for that hemisphere is (0.8 pi R²)/(2 pi R²) )= 0.4, or 40%.

So the filling factor of the hemisphere is 40%, not 20% of the entire star.

So the initial calculation was correct.

Hmm.

After all this, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to Rp/R*=0.2275, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32, assuming that f=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation from the spots is when the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The amplitude of this variation is determined by the spot size and temperature.

The maximum dip would be when the entire spot is in front, which is the same as our previous calculation. But perhaps the average dip is less.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a dip of (f) * (1 - (T_spot/Te)^4 ), which is 0.051775, and the planet's transit is when the area is (Rp/R*)^2, so we set (Rp/R*)^2=0.051775 → Rp/R*=0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as a fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth, not the actual surface area. But that complicates the matter.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)=0.11.

But why? Perhaps I made a mistake and the dip is 0.0121.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.051775, and perhaps the intended answer is the square root of (0.051775/2) → which is approximately 0.1598. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest I can get is option D) 0.32, which would be the case if f=0.2, but according to the problem statement, f should be 0.1.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming that the filling factor is 0.2 of the entire star. But according to the problem statement, it's 20% of one hemisphere, which is f=0.1.

But perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star. So f=0.2.

In that case, the dip is 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355.

Rp/R*=sqrt(0.10355)=0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So I think the intended answer is D.


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same brightness variation in the star's light curve as the observed star with dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (spot temperature = 5000 K). The goal is to compare the amplitude of brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by an exoplanet transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Filling Factor and Spot Coverage**:
   - The filling factor is defined as the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the total filling factor for the entire star is calculated as:
     \[
     f = 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1
     \]
     Thus, the spots cover 10% of the star's total surface area.

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its effective temperature:
     \[
     F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced due to their lower temperature. The flux during the spotted phase is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (1 - f) F_0 + f \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation (relative flux change) is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = f \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
     \]
   - Substituting \(f = 0.1\), \(T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K}\):
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775
     \]
     Thus, the relative brightness variation is approximately \(5.1775\%\).

3. **Exoplanet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F / F_0
     \]
   - Substituting \(\Delta F / F_0 = 0.051775\):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \(R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275\) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **D) ~0.32**, which corresponds to a slightly higher value. This discrepancy may arise if the problem assumes the filling factor \(f\) is 20% of the entire star's surface (i.e., \(f = 0.2\)) rather than one hemisphere.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the potential interpretation of the filling factor, the most reasonable answer is **D) ~0.32**, assuming \(f = 0.2\). This aligns with the problem's intent and the provided choices.

Answer: D
