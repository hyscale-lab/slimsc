Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a compound has chiral centers—so it's not symmetrical. But wait, there are other factors too, like meso compounds or whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure here is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3?

Wait, but more accurately, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, because the double bond is at position 1. Oh wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). Wait, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure would be Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 (but that can't be right). Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 2-methyl, then the structure would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But since it's 1-chloro, the Cl is on C1. So the structure is Cl-C(=C(CH3)CH2CH3). Wait no, perhaps it's Cl attached to a carbon that's double bonded to another carbon which has a methyl group. So, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think of the structure as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, that's 2-chloro. Wait, no, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Then C3 and C4 are CH2 and CH3? Or maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe I should think about the possibility of geometric isomerism here. But the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry. Let's check if this molecule has any chiral centers. The molecule is (Z)-configured. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and another CH2 group (since but-1-ene has four carbons). Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So the structure would be ClCH2-CH=CHCH3. But wait, no, because it's 2-methyl. Oh wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons after the double bond. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so the structure would be Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group, and then C3 and C4. Hmm, wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just consider whether this molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, the molecule is (Z) configuration. But for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. So looking at C2, which is double bonded to C1. Wait, but in this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 and C2 are each part of the double bond. So for C2, what are the substituents? Let's see, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would make the structure Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that seems not, because but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only four carbons. Wait, but that's correct because but has four. So the substituents on the double bond are Cl-CH2 and CH(CH3), and the other two substituents on the double bond are CH2 and CH3? Hmm. Wait, perhaps C2 has a CH(CH3) group, and C1 has Cl and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, for a double bond between C1 and C2, the substituents on each carbon can't have four different groups. Because each carbon in a double bond is bonded to two other carbons (in the case of a double bond in the middle, but in this case, it's at the end). Wait, but in this case, C1 is Cl and CH2, and C2 is CH(CH3) and CH2? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether this molecule has any chiral centers. Since it's a double bond, the molecule is planar around the double bond, so if any of the carbons attached to the double bond have four different substituents, they would be chiral centers. But in this case, for C1, attached groups are Cl, two H's, and a double bond. So that's Cl, H, H, and the double bond. So that's two H's—so same groups, so not a chiral center.

C2 is attached to the double bond, a methyl group, and two other substituents. Let's see: for C2, the substituents are double bond (so maybe two R groups?), a methyl group, and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps the groups on C2 are CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups. Wait, not sure, but perhaps it's better to think that in this molecule, there are no chiral centers because the double bond is at the end, and the substituents on either end are not four different groups.

So, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this looks like a complex bicyclic compound. The substituents are 8-(chloromethylene), meaning a Cl attached to a methylene group (CH2Cl) at position 8. The configuration is E, so there's a double bond in the structure. The molecule has a bridge, possibly making some stereogenic centers.

Wait, the molecule is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So the rings are fused, perhaps with a bridge between carbons 4 and 7. The substituents are at 8 as chloromethylene (CH2Cl). The configuration is E, so the double bond (which one?) has substituents on opposite sides.

But the question is about optical activity, which depends on whether the molecule has a chiral center or not. So, looking at the substituents, especially the bridge, perhaps there are chiral centers in the ring.

The molecule has two stereodescriptors: 3aR and 7aS. That suggests that carbons 3a and 7a have specific configurations. So they are chiral centers. So the molecule has at least two chiral centers, meaning it's not a meso compound because the molecule is complex and probably not symmetrical. So this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. With methyl groups on C2 and C3, so the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH). Wait, no, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then it's HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two methyl groups, two CH2 groups, and two COOH groups. Wait, let's look at C2: groups are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another CH2 (from the chain). Wait, no, wait: The structure would be HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH)CH(CH3) ?

Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two middle CH2 groups. If both are methyl-substituted, then each would have:

C2: attached to two CH3, one CH2-COOH, and the other CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH3 groups, one COOH group from each side, and a CH2 group? No, wait. Each carbon is connected to: for C2, it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. So for C2, substituents are: CH3, CH3, COOH (from C1), and CH(CH3) (from C3). Wait, wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH-CH2-C), no, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if it's 2,3-dimethyl, that would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the two central CH2 groups are C2 and C3. Each is CH2. If they're each substituted with a methyl group, then they become CH(CH3), making the molecule HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of C2 and C3 has the following substituents: two CH3 groups, a COOH group from each end. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) would have:

- One COOH group (from C1: HOOC-)
- One CH(CH3)
- Another CH(CH3) [wait, no, each C is connected to the next]

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two methyl groups (since it's dimethyl)
- Two CH groups connected to the other carbons.

Wait, for C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. So the substituents on C2 would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. Wait, that can’t be right because if it's CH(CH3), then the substituents would be COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups? No, because a CH(CH3) would have one CH3 and one CH2 group or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two chiral centers (C2 and C3) are mirror images of each other, perhaps the whole molecule is a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.

The configuration is (2R,3S). So, C2 is R, and C3 is S. Now, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound. Let's see: the molecule is symmetrical around the center. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, then perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, succinic acid is symmetrical. So, if both C2 and C3 have methyl groups, and their configurations are opposite (R and S), then the molecule might be a meso form and thus not chiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the two central CH(CH3) groups are on either side. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then whether they're mirror images depends on the structure.

In the case of tartaric acid, for example, when the two central carbons are both chiral and have opposite configurations, the molecule can be meso if there's symmetry.

In this case, the molecule is symmetrical because the two central carbons are each CH(CH3), and the substituents on each are arranged symmetrically. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and hence not chiral. So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait another point. The substituents on each chiral center: for C2, substituents are two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3) on the other side. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the actual groups.

For C2: groups would be:
- One methyl (CH3)
- Another methyl (since it's CH(CH3)
Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons is connected to two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a central CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon (C2 and C3) is connected to two methyl groups, a COOH group, and the adjacent CH(CH3). So, for each, the substituents would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and CH3. Oh wait, that's three CH3 groups and a COOH. So, that would make each carbon have four substituents, but two are the same (two CH3). So, in that case, each carbon is CH(CH3)2, which would not be a chiral center because two substituents are the same. Wait, wait, no, because if it's CH(CH3)2, then two substituents are the same (CH3), so the carbon can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but in the given compound, it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So, their structure is CH2-CH2 in succinic acid, now CH(CH3)-CH(CH3). So each of these carbons is CH2 with a methyl substituent, making them CH(CH3).

So, each of these carbons has four substituents: two CH3 (from being CH(CH3)), a COOH group on one side, and a CH(CH3) group on the other. Wait, no, that can't be right. Each of C2 and C3 is connected to two carbons: C1 (COOH-CH2-), C4 (CH2-COOH), and the other C2 and C3 have two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has three substituents: two methyl groups and a CH2 group. So, each is CH(CH3)2, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups. So, in that case, there are no chiral centers, so no optical activity. But that's conflicting with the given configurations (R and S). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, another approach. If the molecule is (2R,3S), then both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, if the configuration is such that C2 is R and C3 is S, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and hence not chiral.

But in this case, the two substituents on each chiral center are the same (two methyl groups?), so perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps each has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual substituents. Let's say for C2:

- One substituent: COOH (from C1: HOOC-)
- Another substituent: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two substituents: CH3 groups.

Wait, that would give four substituents: COOH, CH(CH3) on one side, and two CH3. So, two of the substituents are CH3 and the other two are COOH and CH(CH3). No, wait, each carbon has four substituents.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The C1 (COOH)
- The C3 (CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups (CH3).

Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The COOH group (from C1)
- The CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

So the substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. That's four substituents with two being the same (CH3). So, the substituents are not all different, so C2 is not a chiral center. Same for C3. So, wait, that can't be right because the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies each is a chiral center. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH3 groups (so two substituents)
- One COOH group (from C1)
- One CH(CH3) group (from C3 or C2)

Wait, no, perhaps each CH(CH3) is connected as follows:

C2:

- Connected to C1: which is a COOH group.
- Connected to C3: which is another CH(CH3) group.
- Two methyl groups attached to C2.

So substituents would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. So two CH3, one COOH, one CH(CH3). So, this would make the substituents not all different, so no chiral center. So, the molecule wouldn't have any chiral centers, which contradicts the given R and S configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Maybe the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but each CH(CH3) is connected to the adjacent CH(CH3), so each has substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another CH(CH3). Wait, but that still doesn't make all substituents different.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that if both C2 and C3 are chiral and are in a meso arrangement, then the molecule is achiral. So, in this case, (2R,3S) could lead to a meso form, making the molecule optically inactive. So, this compound is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Same structure as the previous one, but with both configurations R. So, C2 and C3 are both R.

In this case, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the two chiral centers have the same configuration. So, it's not a meso compound. Therefore, this molecule has two chiral centers and no symmetry, making it chiral. So, this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

The configuration is R. So, the OH is on C1, which is a chiral center. Let's check the substituents on C1:

- OH group
- The ring (so two adjacent CH2 groups)
- And probably another substituent.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring: C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and probably a substituent (like CH2 from the ring). Hmm, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Three other groups from the ring, but one of them is a double bond? Or maybe not.

Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C1 is CH2OH (if it's 1-ol), but then in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and possibly substituents.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the structure where C1 has an OH, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a substituent (OH) on C1. Now, the question is whether C1 is a chiral center.

For C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- And the rest is the ring.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring and possibly other substituents. So, C1 has substituents: OH, CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C6), and a double bond?

No, wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C1 is a single bond to C2 and C6. So, C1's substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), which are part of the ring.
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, in a cyclohexene, each carbon is tetravalent. So, C1 has bonds to C2, C6, OH, and a hydrogen. So substituents on C1 are: -OH, -CH2- (C2), -CH2- (C6), and H.

Are any of these substituents the same? Let's see: C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, but attached to different parts of the ring. Are those CH2 groups the same? Since the ring is symmetric, the groups attached to C2 and C6 might be different in terms of their positions relative to the double bond.

Wait, for C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 (but one is adjacent to the double bond and the other is not), and H. So, those substituents are all different. So, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has a chiral center and is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s.

First, determine if any of the OH-bearing carbons are chiral centers. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

C1 has substituents:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- H.

Are the two CH2 groups the same? Let me think about the arrangement. If the ring is symmetric, perhaps the substituents on either side of C1 are the same.

Wait, the molecule is a cyclohexane with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. So, it's a tri-substituted cyclohexane with OH groups in every other position, forming a sort of trigonal arrangement.

Now, looking at C1: substituents are OH, CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C6), and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? Well, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, which has an OH. C6 is connected to C1 and C5, which has an OH. So, the groups attached to C2 and C6 might be different because C2 is next to an OH on C3, and C6 is next to an OH on C5.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, but their neighboring carbons have OH groups. So, the substituents from C2 and C6 are actually CH2 groups attached to different environments. Thus, from C1's perspective, the substituents on C2 and C6 are not identical, making the two CH2 groups different.

Therefore, C1 has four different substituents: OH, CH2-C2 (which is connected to C3-OH), CH2-C6 (connected to C5-OH), and H. So, C1 is a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents as well. So, each OH-bearing carbon is a chiral center. Now, the question is whether the entire molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

With three chiral centers and all s configurations, but let me think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is arranged such that it's symmetrical, perhaps the overall chirality cancels out.

Alternatively, the molecule might be dissymmetric, making it optically active. But with three chiral centers, it's more likely to be chiral unless there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let's think about the positions. The OHs are at 1,3,5 positions, which are all odd positions around the ring, equally spaced. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound.

But for that, the configurations of the chiral centers must be arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical. Let's see, with all s configurations. So, in a cyclohexane, each chiral center is s, perhaps leading to a symmetrical arrangement. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because each of the three centers has different substituents. So, without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would have net chirality.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: if a molecule has an odd number of chiral centers that cannot be paired, it's chiral. Here, three chiral centers would likely make the molecule chiral. Unless there's a plane of symmetry, which I'm not sure exists.

Wait, let's imagine the structure: three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. The ring is symmetrical, so perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to internal planes of symmetry, making it a meso compound. If that's the case, then the molecule would be achiral.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: if the molecule is (1s,3s,5s), then considering the ring's symmetry, each OH is in a symmetrical position relative to others. So, perhaps the molecule is a meso form, making it achiral.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: in a six-membered ring with substituents at 1,3,5, the molecule could have a center of symmetry. For example, a point where each substituent is mirrored. So, maybe the molecule is a meso compound, making it not optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically despite being at symmetrical positions. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of whether there are any identical substituent groups that could make the molecule symmetrical. If each of the OH groups is in a symmetrical position, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

So, perhaps this compound is a meso form and thus not chiral. Therefore, it's not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but wait, the formula would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-... no, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-R. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R? No, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO-R? Wait, let me clarify.

Butanone is (CH3)2CO (for 2-butanone), but 1-butanone would be CH2CH2CH2COH? No, no. Wait, butanone can be 2-butanone (most common), but 1-butanone would be CH2=CHCH2CO something, but perhaps it's more accurate to say that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R. Wait, maybe it's better to think that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R, but perhaps in this case, it's (cyclopentyl)CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but butan-1-one would be:

O
||
C-R-C-C-C.

Wait, maybe it's:

O
||
C-R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the chain is three carbons. So, butan-1-one is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

In this case, R is cyclopentyl, and the chain is 3-methyl. So, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the actual structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclopentyl group. Then, the chain is butan-1-one, which is four carbons in total, with the carbonyl on C1. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-R. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

But regardless, the key point is whether any chiral centers exist.

The carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbon is C2, which is connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, but let me think about substituents on C2. If the structure is CO-cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then C2 is a CH2 group, which is connected to CO, C3, and two H's. So, no chiral center there.

C3, however, is connected to:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (maybe CH2)
- CH(CH3)
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, no, but in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

O
||
C(R)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, R is cyclopentyl. So, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

Looking at C3: substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CO group from C1?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct: the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R. So, the structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-1-one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the carbonyl on the first carbon. So, the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But R in this case is cyclopentyl.

So, the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the carbonyl is on C1 (R is cyclopentyl), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3.

Wait, but the substituent on C3 is CH2, so no chiral center there.

Wait, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the carbonyl on C1. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-.

No, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The main chain is four carbons, starting with the carbonyl. So, carbonyl (C1), then C2, C3, C4. C1: cyclopentyl and the carbonyl. C2: CH2. C3: CH(CH3). C4: CH3.

So, C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), and two CH3 groups (from the methyl substituent and maybe another). Wait, no, C3 is attached to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl group
- And a hydrogen? Or another substituent.

Wait, in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-.

Wait, but then C3 is CH(CH3), which has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and a hydrogen.

So, for C3, substituents are:

- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C4)
- CH3
- H.

Are any of these substituents the same? The two CH2 groups are attached to different carbons. Are those groups identical?

In the context of a carbon's substituents, the two CH2 groups attached to C3 are each connected to different environments (C2 and C4), so they're not identical. Thus, all four substituents are different: CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C4), CH3, and H. So, C3 is a chiral center.

Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

Now, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Possibly a meso compound. Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not meso. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: If it's a meso compound, not active; else, active. I'm not entirely certain, but I'll think it's not a meso form, so it's active. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound. Wait, if all three chiral centers are in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps the molecule is a meso form. So, I'll say no optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center. Optically active.

Wait, let me recheck compound 6. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso form. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. In a six-membered ring, if substituents are at positions 1,3,5, all as s, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus a meso form. So, not optically active.

So, the count of optically active compounds:

Compound 2: yes

Compound 4: yes

Compound 5: yes

Compound7: yes

And compound 6: no.

Wait, let me recount:

1. No

2. Yes (1)

3. No

4. Yes (2)

5. Yes (3)

6. No

7. Yes (4)

So, that's four compounds.

Wait, but I thought that compound 6 is a meso form, so no. So, four in total.

So, the options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

The correct answer is D)4.

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which is essential for optical activity. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry, and it is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral). Let us evaluate each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   This molecule has a double bond at the end of the chain. The substituents on the carbons involved in the double bond are not all different, and there are no chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with specified stereodescriptors (3aR and 7aS). These indicate the presence of chiral centers, and the molecule lacks symmetry. Thus, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons (C2 and C3) that are each bonded to two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and another carbon. The configurations (2R,3S) suggest that the molecule could be a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Similar to the previous compound, but with both configurations as R. This arrangement lacks symmetry and is not a meso compound. Since there are two chiral centers with no internal symmetry, the molecule is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   This compound has a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1. The substituents on C1 are -OH, two different CH2 groups, and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   This is a cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all with the s configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it is not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   This compound has a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3. The substituents on C3 are -CH2 (from C2), -CH2 (from C4), -CH3, and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
- Compound 1: No  
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: No  
- Compound 4: Yes  
- Compound 5: Yes  
- Compound 6: No  
- Compound 7: Yes  

### Total: 4 optically active compounds.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a compound has chiral centers—so it's not symmetrical. But wait, there are other factors too, like meso compounds or whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure here is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3?

Wait, but more accurately, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, because the double bond is at position 1. Oh wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). Wait, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure would be Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 (but that can't be right). Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 2-methyl, then the structure would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But since it's 1-chloro, the Cl is on C1. So the structure is Cl-C(=C(CH3)CH2CH3). Wait no, perhaps it's Cl attached to a carbon that's double bonded to another carbon which has a methyl group. So, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think of the structure as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, that's 2-chloro. Wait, no, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Then C3 and C4 are CH2 and CH3? Or maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe I should think about the possibility of geometric isomerism here. But the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry. Let's check if this molecule has any chiral centers. The molecule is (Z)-configured. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and another CH2 group (since but-1-ene has four carbons). Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So the structure would be ClCH2-CH=CHCH3. But wait, no, because it's 2-methyl. Oh wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons after the double bond. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so the structure would be Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group, and then C3 and C4. Hmm, wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just consider whether this molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, the molecule is (Z) configuration. But for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. So looking at C2, which is double bonded to C1. Wait, but in this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 and C2 are each part of the double bond. So for C2, what are the substituents? Let's see, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would make the structure Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that seems not, because but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only four carbons. Wait, but that's correct because but has four. So the substituents on the double bond are Cl-CH2 and CH(CH3), and the other two substituents on the double bond are CH2 and CH3? Hmm. Wait, perhaps C2 has a CH(CH3) group, and C1 has Cl and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, for a double bond between C1 and C2, the substituents on each carbon can't have four different groups. Because each carbon in a double bond is bonded to two other carbons (in the case of a double bond in the middle, but in this case, it's at the end). Wait, but in this case, C1 is Cl and CH2, and C2 is CH(CH3) and CH2? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether this molecule has any chiral centers. Since it's a double bond, the molecule is planar around the double bond, so if any of the carbons attached to the double bond have four different substituents, they would be chiral centers. But in this case, for C1, attached groups are Cl, two H's, and a double bond. So that's Cl, H, H, and the double bond. So that's two H's—so same groups, so not a chiral center.

C2 is attached to the double bond, a methyl group, and two other substituents. Let's see: for C2, the substituents are double bond (so maybe two R groups?), a methyl group, and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps the groups on C2 are CH(CH3), CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups. Wait, not sure, but perhaps it's better to think that in this molecule, there are no chiral centers because the double bond is at the end, and the substituents on either end are not four different groups.

So, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this looks like a complex bicyclic compound. The substituents are 8-(chloromethylene), meaning a Cl attached to a methylene group (CH2Cl) at position 8. The configuration is E, so there's a double bond in the structure. The molecule has a bridge, possibly making some stereogenic centers.

Wait, the molecule is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So the rings are fused, perhaps with a bridge between carbons 4 and 7. The substituents are at 8 as chloromethylene (CH2Cl). The configuration is E, so the double bond (which one?) has substituents on opposite sides.

But the question is about optical activity, which depends on whether the molecule has a chiral center or not. So, looking at the substituents, especially the bridge, perhaps there are chiral centers in the ring.

The molecule has two stereodescriptors: 3aR and 7aS. That suggests that carbons 3a and 7a have specific configurations. So they are chiral centers. So the molecule has at least two chiral centers, meaning it's not a meso compound because the molecule is complex and probably not symmetrical. So this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. With methyl groups on C2 and C3, so the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH). Wait, no, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then it's HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two methyl groups, two CH2 groups, and two COOH groups. Wait, let's look at C2: groups are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another CH2 (from the chain). Wait, no, wait: The structure would be HOOC-C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH)CH(CH3) ?

Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two middle CH2 groups. If both are methyl-substituted, then each would have:

C2: attached to two CH3, one CH2-COOH, and the other CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH3 groups, one COOH group from each side, and a CH2 group? No, wait. Each carbon is connected to: for C2, it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. So for C2, substituents are: CH3, CH3, COOH (from C1), and CH(CH3) (from C3). Wait, wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH-CH2-C), no, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if it's 2,3-dimethyl, that would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the two central CH2 groups are C2 and C3. Each is CH2. If they're each substituted with a methyl group, then they become CH(CH3), making the molecule HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of C2 and C3 has the following substituents: two CH3 groups, a COOH group from each end. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) would have:

- One COOH group (from C1: HOOC-)
- One CH(CH3)
- Another CH(CH3) [wait, no, each C is connected to the next]

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two methyl groups (since it's dimethyl)
- Two CH groups connected to the other carbons.

Wait, for C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. So the substituents on C2 would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. Wait, that can’t be right because if it's CH(CH3), then the substituents would be COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups? No, because a CH(CH3) would have one CH3 and one CH2 group or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two chiral centers (C2 and C3) are mirror images of each other, perhaps the whole molecule is a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers.

The configuration is (2R,3S). So, C2 is R, and C3 is S. Now, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound. Let's see: the molecule is symmetrical around the center. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, then perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, succinic acid is symmetrical. So, if both C2 and C3 have methyl groups, and their configurations are opposite (R and S), then the molecule might be a meso form and thus not chiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the two central CH(CH3) groups are on either side. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then whether they're mirror images depends on the structure.

In the case of tartaric acid, for example, when the two central carbons are both chiral and have opposite configurations, the molecule can be meso if there's symmetry.

In this case, the molecule is symmetrical because the two central carbons are each CH(CH3), and the substituents on each are arranged symmetrically. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and hence not chiral. So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait another point. The substituents on each chiral center: for C2, substituents are two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3) on the other side. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the actual groups.

For C2: groups would be:
- One methyl (CH3)
- Another methyl (since it's CH(CH3)
Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons is connected to two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a central CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon (C2 and C3) is connected to two methyl groups, a COOH group, and the adjacent CH(CH3). So, for each, the substituents would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and CH3. Oh wait, that's three CH3 groups and a COOH. So, that would make each carbon have four substituents, but two are the same (two CH3). So, in that case, each carbon is CH(CH3)2, which would not be a chiral center because two substituents are the same. Wait, wait, no, because if it's CH(CH3)2, then two substituents are the same (CH3), so the carbon can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but in the given compound, it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So, their structure is CH2-CH2 in succinic acid, now CH(CH3)-CH(CH3). So each of these carbons is CH2 with a methyl substituent, making them CH(CH3).

So, each of these carbons has four substituents: two CH3 (from being CH(CH3)), a COOH group on one side, and a CH(CH3) group on the other. Wait, no, that can't be right. Each of C2 and C3 is connected to two carbons: C1 (COOH-CH2-), C4 (CH2-COOH), and the other C2 and C3 have two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has three substituents: two methyl groups and a CH2 group. So, each is CH(CH3)2, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups. So, in that case, there are no chiral centers, so no optical activity. But that's conflicting with the given configurations (R and S). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, another approach. If the molecule is (2R,3S), then both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, if the configuration is such that C2 is R and C3 is S, and the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and hence not chiral.

But in this case, the two substituents on each chiral center are the same (two methyl groups?), so perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps each has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual substituents. Let's say for C2:

- One substituent: COOH (from C1: HOOC-)
- Another substituent: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two substituents: CH3 groups.

Wait, that would give four substituents: COOH, CH(CH3) on one side, and two CH3. So, two of the substituents are CH3 and the other two are COOH and CH(CH3). No, wait, each carbon has four substituents.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The C1 (COOH)
- The C3 (CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups (CH3).

Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The COOH group (from C1)
- The CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

So the substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. That's four substituents with two being the same (CH3). So, the substituents are not all different, so C2 is not a chiral center. Same for C3. So, wait, that can't be right because the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies each is a chiral center. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH3 groups (so two substituents)
- One COOH group (from C1)
- One CH(CH3) group (from C3 or C2)

Wait, no, perhaps each CH(CH3) is connected as follows:

C2:

- Connected to C1: which is a COOH group.
- Connected to C3: which is another CH(CH3) group.
- Two methyl groups attached to C2.

So substituents would be: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. So two CH3, one COOH, one CH(CH3). So, this would make the substituents not all different, so no chiral center. So, the molecule wouldn't have any chiral centers, which contradicts the given R and S configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Maybe the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but each CH(CH3) is connected to the adjacent CH(CH3), so each has substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another CH(CH3). Wait, but that still doesn't make all substituents different.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that if both C2 and C3 are chiral and are in a meso arrangement, then the molecule is achiral. So, in this case, (2R,3S) could lead to a meso form, making the molecule optically inactive. So, this compound is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Same structure as the previous one, but with both configurations R. So, C2 and C3 are both R.

In this case, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the two chiral centers have the same configuration. So, it's not a meso compound. Therefore, this molecule has two chiral centers and no symmetry, making it chiral. So, this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

The configuration is R. So, the OH is on C1, which is a chiral center. Let's check the substituents on C1:

- OH group
- The ring (so two adjacent CH2 groups)
- And probably another substituent.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring: C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and probably a substituent (like CH2 from the ring). Hmm, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Three other groups from the ring, but one of them is a double bond? Or maybe not.

Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C1 is CH2OH (if it's 1-ol), but then in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and possibly substituents.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the structure where C1 has an OH, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a substituent (OH) on C1. Now, the question is whether C1 is a chiral center.

For C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- And the rest is the ring.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring and possibly other substituents. So, C1 has substituents: OH, CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C6), and a double bond?

No, wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C1 is a single bond to C2 and C6. So, C1's substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), which are part of the ring.
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, in a cyclohexene, each carbon is tetravalent. So, C1 has bonds to C2, C6, OH, and a hydrogen. So substituents on C1 are: -OH, -CH2- (C2), -CH2- (C6), and H.

Are any of these substituents the same? Let's see: C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, but attached to different parts of the ring. Are those CH2 groups the same? Since the ring is symmetric, the groups attached to C2 and C6 might be different in terms of their positions relative to the double bond.

Wait, for C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 (but one is adjacent to the double bond and the other is not), and H. So, those substituents are all different. So, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has a chiral center and is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s.

First, determine if any of the OH-bearing carbons are chiral centers. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

C1 has substituents:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- H.

Are the two CH2 groups the same? Let me think about the arrangement. If the ring is symmetric, perhaps the substituents on either side of C1 are the same.

Wait, the molecule is a cyclohexane with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. So, it's a tri-substituted cyclohexane with OH groups in every other position, forming a sort of trigonal arrangement.

Now, looking at C1: substituents are OH, CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C6), and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? Well, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, which has an OH. C6 is connected to C1 and C5, which has an OH. So, the groups attached to C2 and C6 might be different because C2 is next to an OH on C3, and C6 is next to an OH on C5.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, but their neighboring carbons have OH groups. So, the substituents from C2 and C6 are actually CH2 groups attached to different environments. Thus, from C1's perspective, the substituents on C2 and C6 are not identical, making the two CH2 groups different.

Therefore, C1 has four different substituents: OH, CH2-C2 (which is connected to C3-OH), CH2-C6 (connected to C5-OH), and H. So, C1 is a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents as well. So, each OH-bearing carbon is a chiral center. Now, the question is whether the entire molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

With three chiral centers and all s configurations, but let me think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is arranged such that it's symmetrical, perhaps the overall chirality cancels out.

Alternatively, the molecule might be dissymmetric, making it optically active. But with three chiral centers, it's more likely to be chiral unless there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let's think about the positions. The OHs are at 1,3,5 positions, which are all odd positions around the ring, equally spaced. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound.

But for that, the configurations of the chiral centers must be arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical. Let's see, with all s configurations. So, in a cyclohexane, each chiral center is s, perhaps leading to a symmetrical arrangement. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because each of the three centers has different substituents. So, without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would have net chirality.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: if a molecule has an odd number of chiral centers that cannot be paired, it's chiral. Here, three chiral centers would likely make the molecule chiral. Unless there's a plane of symmetry, which I'm not sure exists.

Wait, let's imagine the structure: three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. The ring is symmetrical, so perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to internal planes of symmetry, making it a meso compound. If that's the case, then the molecule would be achiral.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: if the molecule is (1s,3s,5s), then considering the ring's symmetry, each OH is in a symmetrical position relative to others. So, perhaps the molecule is a meso form, making it achiral.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: in a six-membered ring with substituents at 1,3,5, the molecule could have a center of symmetry. For example, a point where each substituent is mirrored. So, maybe the molecule is a meso compound, making it not optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically despite being at symmetrical positions. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of whether there are any identical substituent groups that could make the molecule symmetrical. If each of the OH groups is in a symmetrical position, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

So, perhaps this compound is a meso form and thus not chiral. Therefore, it's not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but wait, the formula would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-... no, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-R. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R? No, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO-R? Wait, let me clarify.

Butanone is (CH3)2CO (for 2-butanone), but 1-butanone would be CH2CH2CH2COH? No, no. Wait, butanone can be 2-butanone (most common), but 1-butanone would be CH2=CHCH2CO something, but perhaps it's more accurate to say that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R. Wait, maybe it's better to think that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-R, but perhaps in this case, it's (cyclopentyl)CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but butan-1-one would be:

O
||
C-R-C-C-C.

Wait, maybe it's:

O
||
C-R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the chain is three carbons. So, butan-1-one is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

In this case, R is cyclopentyl, and the chain is 3-methyl. So, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the actual structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to the cyclopentyl group. Then, the chain is butan-1-one, which is four carbons in total, with the carbonyl on C1. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-R. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

But regardless, the key point is whether any chiral centers exist.

The carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbon is C2, which is connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, but let me think about substituents on C2. If the structure is CO-cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then C2 is a CH2 group, which is connected to CO, C3, and two H's. So, no chiral center there.

C3, however, is connected to:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (maybe CH2)
- CH(CH3)
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, no, but in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

O
||
C(R)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, R is cyclopentyl. So, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

Looking at C3: substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CO group from C1?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct: the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R. So, the structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-1-one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the carbonyl on the first carbon. So, the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But R in this case is cyclopentyl.

So, the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the carbonyl is on C1 (R is cyclopentyl), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3.

Wait, but the substituent on C3 is CH2, so no chiral center there.

Wait, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the carbonyl on C1. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-.

No, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The main chain is four carbons, starting with the carbonyl. So, carbonyl (C1), then C2, C3, C4. C1: cyclopentyl and the carbonyl. C2: CH2. C3: CH(CH3). C4: CH3.

So, C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), and two CH3 groups (from the methyl substituent and maybe another). Wait, no, C3 is attached to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl group
- And a hydrogen? Or another substituent.

Wait, in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-.

Wait, but then C3 is CH(CH3), which has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and a hydrogen.

So, for C3, substituents are:

- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C4)
- CH3
- H.

Are any of these substituents the same? The two CH2 groups are attached to different carbons. Are those groups identical?

In the context of a carbon's substituents, the two CH2 groups attached to C3 are each connected to different environments (C2 and C4), so they're not identical. Thus, all four substituents are different: CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C4), CH3, and H. So, C3 is a chiral center.

Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

Now, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Possibly a meso compound. Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not meso. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: If it's a meso compound, not active; else, active. I'm not entirely certain, but I'll think it's not a meso form, so it's active. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound. Wait, if all three chiral centers are in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps the molecule is a meso form. So, I'll say no optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center. Optically active.

Wait, let me recheck compound 6. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso form. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. In a six-membered ring, if substituents are at positions 1,3,5, all as s, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus a meso form. So, not optically active.

So, the count of optically active compounds:

Compound 2: yes

Compound 4: yes

Compound 5: yes

Compound7: yes

And compound 6: no.

Wait, let me recount:

1. No

2. Yes (1)

3. No

4. Yes (2)

5. Yes (3)

6. No

7. Yes (4)

So, that's four compounds.

Wait, but I thought that compound 6 is a meso form, so no. So, four in total.

So, the options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

The correct answer is D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which is essential for optical activity. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry, and it is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral). Let us evaluate each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   This molecule has a double bond at the end of the chain. The substituents on the carbons involved in the double bond are not all different, and there are no chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with specified stereodescriptors (3aR and 7aS). These indicate the presence of chiral centers, and the molecule lacks symmetry. Thus, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons (C2 and C3) that are each bonded to two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and another carbon. The configurations (2R,3S) suggest that the molecule could be a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Similar to the previous compound, but with both configurations as R. This arrangement lacks symmetry and is not a meso compound. Since there are two chiral centers with no internal symmetry, the molecule is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   This compound has a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1. The substituents on C1 are -OH, two different CH2 groups, and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   This is a cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all with the s configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. As a result, it is not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   This compound has a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3. The substituents on C3 are -CH2 (from C2), -CH2 (from C4), -CH3, and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
- Compound 1: No  
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: No  
- Compound 4: Yes  
- Compound 5: Yes  
- Compound 6: No  
- Compound 7: Yes  

### Total: 4 optically active compounds.
