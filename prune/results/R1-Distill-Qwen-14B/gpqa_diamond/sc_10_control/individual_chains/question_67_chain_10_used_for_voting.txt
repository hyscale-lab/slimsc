Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that for an electron in an p orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1 because p orbitals are denoted by l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, right? So when you couple two angular momenta, l1 and l2, the possible total l values are |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so possible l values are 0, 1, 2. So the total l here is 2, which makes sense because they're adding up to the maximum possible.

The m value is -1. Hmm, because m is the z-component of the total angular momentum. So for each particle, their individual m values (m1 and m2) add up to m_total. But wait, wait. Wait, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So that means the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its m is -1.

But the question is about measuring the individual L_z components of each particle, L1z and L2z. And we need the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. Oh, so each L_z has eigenvalues mħ, right? So for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but in the coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 values are such that m1 + m2 = m_total. But here, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

We're to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, because L1z eigenvalue is m1ħ = (-1)ħ and same for L2z, so both would be -ħ.

So the question is, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, what's the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Because m1 + m2 = -1, so m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, or m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=1 and m2=-2? Wait wait, no, because each m can only be -1, 0, +1. Oh wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So if m1 is 1, m2 must be -2, which is impossible. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that add up to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because m1 can be -1,0,1, m2 likewise. So let's list all possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1
Wait, are there any other possibilities? Like m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2, so no. So only two possible combinations.

But the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum coupling, but I remember that when you have two angular momenta, the coupled state is a linear combination of the product states. So |l1, l2, l, m> is a sum over all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m.

Wait, no, wait. The coupled state is not a product state, it's a combination. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a sum of the possible product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the product states are |1,m1> |1,m2>, and when you combine them, you get the coupled state.

So to express |1,1,2,-1>, you need to find all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1, which as before are (-1,0) and (0,-1). But wait, is that correct? Because for l=2, the m can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So how does the state |1,1,2,-1> look in terms of the product states?

Wait, I think the general approach is to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1 l2; L M> is expressed as a sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, of the product of the |l1 m1> and |l2 m2> states, multiplied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

So for our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of the product states |1,m1>|1,m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

So let's list those possible (m1, m2) pairs:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → m1 + m2 = -1
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → m1 + m2 = -1

Wait, is that all? Let me check: m1 can be -1, 0, 1. m2 same. So for sum to be -1:

- m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → valid
- m1 = 0 → m2 = -1 → valid
- m1 = 1 → m2 = -2 → invalid (since m2 can't be less than -1 for l=1)
So only two product states contribute.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>, each multiplied by their respective Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

What are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case?

I remember that for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like spin-1), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients have specific values. But wait, wait. Electrons have spin 1/2, but here we're talking about orbital angular momentum, l=1, which is analogous to spin 1. So the same CG coefficients apply.

The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta j1 and j2 to get J.

Wait, for j1 = j2 = 1, and J=2, M= m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( something ) [ |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ]

But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think. For the case of adding two spin-1 particles to get J=2, M= -1.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for J=2, M=-1 are as follows. The CG coefficient for m1= -1, m2=0 is sqrt( (2 - (-1)) / (2 + 1) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the specific formula. Another approach: The CG coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known values.

Wait, another approach: When adding two angular momenta with l1 = l2 = 1, the state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a combination of the two product states.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible m1 and m2. Let me write the state as a linear combination:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |1,-1>|1,0> + b * |1,0>|1,-1>

Because those are the only two product states that sum to M=-1.

Now, I need to find the coefficients a and b. The square of the coefficients should sum to 1.

I think the coefficients can be found as follows. The CG coefficients for J=2, M=-1 would be:

sqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + 1) ) / ( (2 + 1)(2 + 1) ) ) ) ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the CG coefficients for j1 = j2 = 1, J=2, and M.

Wait, perhaps a table would help. Alternatively, I can reason that for two spin-1 particles, the states |2, m> are constructed as follows.

The state |2, 2> is |1,1> |1,1> → only one term.

|2,1> is sqrt( (2*(2+1))/(1*(1+1+1) )) ? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think for |2, -1>, the state is (|1, -1>|1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you add two l=1 particles to get l=2, the state |2, -1> should be a symmetric combination of the product states |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

In the case of l1=l2=1, the state |J=2, M=-1> can be written as:

sqrt( (2 + 1) / ( (2) (2 + 1) )) ) [ |1, -1> |1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> ].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I'll use the explicit formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The CG coefficient for j1=1, m1; j2=1, m2; J=2, M is given by:

< j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M > = [ ( (2J +1) (J - M + m1)(J + M - m2) ) / ( (J + m1 + m2 - M) (J - m1 - m2 + M) (m1 - m2 + M) (m1 - m2 - M) ) ) ]^{1/2}

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the CG coefficients when j1 = j2 = l.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the possible states.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact coefficients, but perhaps I can reason about their values. Suppose I have a state which is a combination of two terms. The normalization would require that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But wait, in this case, the state |1,1,2,-1> would have a coefficient for each possible (m1, m2) pair that sums to -1. So for m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. 

But perhaps there's another approach: the state |l1, l2, L, M> is symmetric under exchange of particles if l1=l2. Wait, since l1 and l2 are both 1, the state should be symmetric under exchange. Wait, no, because in angular momentum coupling, the state transforms under the exchange, but whether it's symmetric or antisymmetric depends on the specific quantum numbers.

Wait, for two identical particles (like electrons), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, in this problem, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part, not spin. Oh, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. So perhaps the state is only considering the orbital part, and the spin part is not being considered here.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we only have the orbital angular momentum state. So the wavefunction for the orbital part is symmetric under exchange? Because electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction (which includes spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps the orbital part alone can be symmetric or antisymmetric? Hmm, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum state, so perhaps that's taken care of in the problem setup.

But maybe that's a red herring for this problem. Let me refocus.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states |1, m1> |1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the question is, what is the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both have eigenvalues -ħ. Which would correspond to m1=-1 and m2=-1. But wait, m1 + m2 would have to be -2, but the total M is -1. So that's impossible. Because in the coupled state, M=-1, so m1 + m2 must be -1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1.

Wait a second, that can't happen. Because in the coupled state, the sum m1 + m2 is fixed to M. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, any measurement of L_z for each particle must have m1 + m2 = -1. So for both m1 and m2 to be -1, the sum would be -2, which is not compatible with the state.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. Because that would require M = -2, which is not the case here.

So the answer should be D) 0.

Wait, but in the state, can the individual m's add up to something else outside of M? No, because the state is an eigenstate of L_z, which is L1z + L2z. So the eigenvalue is Mħ. So when you measure L1z and L2z, their sum must be Mħ. So in this case, M is -1, so the sum of the two m's is -1. So if you get m1=-1 and m2=-1, that sum is -2, which contradicts M=-1. So this outcome is impossible. So the probability is zero.

So the correct answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and \( m = -1 \) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State and Measurement**:  
   The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) represents a linear combination of product states \( |l_1, m_1\rangle |l_2, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = m = -1 \). The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:
   - \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \)
   - \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \)

   These are the only valid combinations because \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) can only take values \( -1, 0, +1 \) for \( l = 1 \).

2. **Impossibility of \( m_1 = m_2 = -1 \)**:  
   For both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) to have eigenvalues \( -\hbar \), it would require \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, this would give \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which contradicts the total \( m = -1 \) of the coupled state. Since the total angular momentum \( m \) is fixed by the state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), this outcome is impossible.

3. **Probability of the Outcome**:  
   The joint probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is therefore zero because such a measurement would violate the conservation of total angular momentum \( m = -1 \).

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of obtaining \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is **0**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that for an electron in an p orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1 because p orbitals are denoted by l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, right? So when you couple two angular momenta, l1 and l2, the possible total l values are |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so possible l values are 0, 1, 2. So the total l here is 2, which makes sense because they're adding up to the maximum possible.

The m value is -1. Hmm, because m is the z-component of the total angular momentum. So for each particle, their individual m values (m1 and m2) add up to m_total. But wait, wait. Wait, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So that means the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its m is -1.

But the question is about measuring the individual L_z components of each particle, L1z and L2z. And we need the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. Oh, so each L_z has eigenvalues mħ, right? So for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but in the coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 values are such that m1 + m2 = m_total. But here, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

We're to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, because L1z eigenvalue is m1ħ = (-1)ħ and same for L2z, so both would be -ħ.

So the question is, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, what's the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Because m1 + m2 = -1, so m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, or m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=1 and m2=-2? Wait wait, no, because each m can only be -1, 0, +1. Oh wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So if m1 is 1, m2 must be -2, which is impossible. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that add up to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because m1 can be -1,0,1, m2 likewise. So let's list all possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1
Wait, are there any other possibilities? Like m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2, so no. So only two possible combinations.

But the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum coupling, but I remember that when you have two angular momenta, the coupled state is a linear combination of the product states. So |l1, l2, l, m> is a sum over all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m.

Wait, no, wait. The coupled state is not a product state, it's a combination. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a sum of the possible product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the product states are |1,m1> |1,m2>, and when you combine them, you get the coupled state.

So to express |1,1,2,-1>, you need to find all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1, which as before are (-1,0) and (0,-1). But wait, is that correct? Because for l=2, the m can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So how does the state |1,1,2,-1> look in terms of the product states?

Wait, I think the general approach is to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1 l2; L M> is expressed as a sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, of the product of the |l1 m1> and |l2 m2> states, multiplied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

So for our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of the product states |1,m1>|1,m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

So let's list those possible (m1, m2) pairs:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → m1 + m2 = -1
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → m1 + m2 = -1

Wait, is that all? Let me check: m1 can be -1, 0, 1. m2 same. So for sum to be -1:

- m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → valid
- m1 = 0 → m2 = -1 → valid
- m1 = 1 → m2 = -2 → invalid (since m2 can't be less than -1 for l=1)
So only two product states contribute.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>, each multiplied by their respective Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

What are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case?

I remember that for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like spin-1), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients have specific values. But wait, wait. Electrons have spin 1/2, but here we're talking about orbital angular momentum, l=1, which is analogous to spin 1. So the same CG coefficients apply.

The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta j1 and j2 to get J.

Wait, for j1 = j2 = 1, and J=2, M= m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( something ) [ |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ]

But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think. For the case of adding two spin-1 particles to get J=2, M= -1.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for J=2, M=-1 are as follows. The CG coefficient for m1= -1, m2=0 is sqrt( (2 - (-1)) / (2 + 1) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the specific formula. Another approach: The CG coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known values.

Wait, another approach: When adding two angular momenta with l1 = l2 = 1, the state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a combination of the two product states.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible m1 and m2. Let me write the state as a linear combination:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |1,-1>|1,0> + b * |1,0>|1,-1>

Because those are the only two product states that sum to M=-1.

Now, I need to find the coefficients a and b. The square of the coefficients should sum to 1.

I think the coefficients can be found as follows. The CG coefficients for J=2, M=-1 would be:

sqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + 1) ) / ( (2 + 1)(2 + 1) ) ) ) ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the CG coefficients for j1 = j2 = 1, J=2, and M.

Wait, perhaps a table would help. Alternatively, I can reason that for two spin-1 particles, the states |2, m> are constructed as follows.

The state |2, 2> is |1,1> |1,1> → only one term.

|2,1> is sqrt( (2*(2+1))/(1*(1+1+1) )) ? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think for |2, -1>, the state is (|1, -1>|1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you add two l=1 particles to get l=2, the state |2, -1> should be a symmetric combination of the product states |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

In the case of l1=l2=1, the state |J=2, M=-1> can be written as:

sqrt( (2 + 1) / ( (2) (2 + 1) )) ) [ |1, -1> |1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1> ].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I'll use the explicit formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The CG coefficient for j1=1, m1; j2=1, m2; J=2, M is given by:

< j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M > = [ ( (2J +1) (J - M + m1)(J + M - m2) ) / ( (J + m1 + m2 - M) (J - m1 - m2 + M) (m1 - m2 + M) (m1 - m2 - M) ) ) ]^{1/2}

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the CG coefficients when j1 = j2 = l.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the possible states.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact coefficients, but perhaps I can reason about their values. Suppose I have a state which is a combination of two terms. The normalization would require that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But wait, in this case, the state |1,1,2,-1> would have a coefficient for each possible (m1, m2) pair that sums to -1. So for m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. 

But perhaps there's another approach: the state |l1, l2, L, M> is symmetric under exchange of particles if l1=l2. Wait, since l1 and l2 are both 1, the state should be symmetric under exchange. Wait, no, because in angular momentum coupling, the state transforms under the exchange, but whether it's symmetric or antisymmetric depends on the specific quantum numbers.

Wait, for two identical particles (like electrons), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, in this problem, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part, not spin. Oh, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. So perhaps the state is only considering the orbital part, and the spin part is not being considered here.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we only have the orbital angular momentum state. So the wavefunction for the orbital part is symmetric under exchange? Because electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction (which includes spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps the orbital part alone can be symmetric or antisymmetric? Hmm, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum state, so perhaps that's taken care of in the problem setup.

But maybe that's a red herring for this problem. Let me refocus.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states |1, m1> |1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the question is, what is the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both have eigenvalues -ħ. Which would correspond to m1=-1 and m2=-1. But wait, m1 + m2 would have to be -2, but the total M is -1. So that's impossible. Because in the coupled state, M=-1, so m1 + m2 must be -1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1.

Wait a second, that can't happen. Because in the coupled state, the sum m1 + m2 is fixed to M. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, any measurement of L_z for each particle must have m1 + m2 = -1. So for both m1 and m2 to be -1, the sum would be -2, which is not compatible with the state.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. Because that would require M = -2, which is not the case here.

So the answer should be D) 0.

Wait, but in the state, can the individual m's add up to something else outside of M? No, because the state is an eigenstate of L_z, which is L1z + L2z. So the eigenvalue is Mħ. So when you measure L1z and L2z, their sum must be Mħ. So in this case, M is -1, so the sum of the two m's is -1. So if you get m1=-1 and m2=-1, that sum is -2, which contradicts M=-1. So this outcome is impossible. So the probability is zero.

So the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and \( m = -1 \) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State and Measurement**:  
   The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) represents a linear combination of product states \( |l_1, m_1\rangle |l_2, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = m = -1 \). The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:
   - \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \)
   - \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \)

   These are the only valid combinations because \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) can only take values \( -1, 0, +1 \) for \( l = 1 \).

2. **Impossibility of \( m_1 = m_2 = -1 \)**:  
   For both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) to have eigenvalues \( -\hbar \), it would require \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, this would give \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which contradicts the total \( m = -1 \) of the coupled state. Since the total angular momentum \( m \) is fixed by the state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), this outcome is impossible.

3. **Probability of the Outcome**:  
   The joint probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is therefore zero because such a measurement would violate the conservation of total angular momentum \( m = -1 \).

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of obtaining \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is **0**.
