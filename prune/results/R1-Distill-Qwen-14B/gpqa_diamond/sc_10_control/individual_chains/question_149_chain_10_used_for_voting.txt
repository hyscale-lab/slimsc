Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound analysis. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The scenario is that a small peptide was synthesized, and they're looking at the NMR and LC-MS data.

So, the 1H NMR shows peaks consistent with the expected molecule, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Also, rule out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Wait, so if it's not coupling, why are there two peaks?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which fits the expected molecule. Oh, so the molecular weight is the same but there are two peaks. What could cause that?

Let me think about the options. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Since the mass spec shows the same, that's probably not it. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the mass spec would look the same. But in LC-MS, how would that show? I think enantiomers might have similar retention times but maybe not exactly the same, but in some cases, maybe they are separated. But wait, if it's a small peptide, maybe it's chiral. But in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the protons would have the same environment, but wait—if the alpha protons are in a chiral environment, maybe their shifts would be the same. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't split into two peaks unless there's some coupling. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps if the molecule is a diastereomer, but that's another option.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, some kind of coupling happened that duplicated the proton. I'm not too familiar with that term. Alternatively, maybe it's about some sort of isomerization or tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different retention times in LC. And their NMR would show different peaks because the environments are different. But wait, the problem says that the NMR is consistent except for those two alpha protons. If it's a diastereomer, the coupling patterns would differ. Oh, but the problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton? Or maybe in the diastereomer, the alpha proton is in a similar environment, but perhaps split differently. Hmm, but the integrals add up to 1H, which suggests each peak is half, and each is one proton. So perhaps each diastereomer has that same proton, but maybe in a different configuration. Wait, but diastereomers would have different coupling constants. Or maybe for a particular proton, perhaps the coupling isn't observed because of symmetry or something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. How could that happen? One possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture (enantiomers), but that usually doesn't split the proton into two unless there's something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a mix of diastereomers, each causing the alpha proton to split into a different peak. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Another angle: The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. If the molecular ion is the same, but the same mass. But if they are diastereomers, their mass would be same because same molecular formula. So the same mass makes sense. But why would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton? If there are two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. Wait, but the question says the NMR is mostly consistent except for two peaks, which together integrate to 1H. So for each diastereomer, maybe the alpha proton is equivalent in some way that causes the same shift, but they are separate. Hmm, but that doesn't add up. Or maybe in each diastereomer, the environment of the alpha proton is different enough to have a different shift, but similar shifts, so the peaks are close but not identical. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So if two diastereomers, the alpha protons might have similar shifts, but why would they each have half the integral?

Wait, perhaps the NMR is showing a diastereotopic situation? Or maybe the molecule has some kind of dynamic process, like a rapidly interconverting diastereomer? No, but the question says the peaks are both present, so it's not a splitting due to coupling.

Wait, another thought: In the crude compound, maybe the desired product is in a mixture with a byproduct that has the same molecular weight. But the mass is same, so same molecular formula. So perhaps it's a diastereomer. Because if you have diastereomers, their molecular weights are same but physical properties differ.

So if the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, the LC would separate them into two peaks, each with same mass. In the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute to the same set of signals, but for this specific alpha proton, perhaps each diastereomer has the same shift but the protons are in different environments, so you get two separate peaks integrating to 1H each, but together 2H? Wait no, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each would be 0.5H, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, if the compound has two diastereomers, each would have one alpha proton. So the NMR would show a peak for each diastereomer's alpha proton. If the environments are similar, the shifts would be similar. So each peak would have integral of 1H, but in the sample, perhaps it's a 1:1 mixture. So in NMR, they would add up as 2H. But the question says the integral is 1H together. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's not diastereomers.

Wait, let's go back. The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. The integrals are roughly equal, so together 1H. So each is about 0.5H. But how can that happen?

Another possibility is that the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, and the alpha proton is in a chiral environment. But in that case, for each enantiomer, the alpha proton would have the same shift, but in the NMR, they'd be a singlet because of symmetry. Wait, no—if the molecule is a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer's alpha proton would have the same shift, so you'd just see a single peak. So why are there two peaks?

Alternatively, perhaps the alpha proton is in a situation where the molecule has some kind of symmetry, but the environment causes the proton to split into two. Wait, but the question says spin-spin coupling was ruled out. So it's not the case that the proton is coupling with another proton.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the amide bond formation didn't proceed completely, leading to some sort of double bond or different stereochemistry. But I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means in option C. Maybe the amide bond formation involved some kind of coupling that led to the same proton appearing twice. But I'm not certain about that.

Another angle—what if the crude compound has an impurity that's an isomer with same molecular formula but different structure. For example, a diastereomer. So if the synthesis didn't go 100% to plan, perhaps some diastereomers are formed. Then, the LC-MS would separate them, and the NMR would show different shifts for each diastereomer's protons.

Wait, but how would the same alpha proton appear as two peaks in the NMR? Maybe because each diastereomer's alpha proton has a slightly different shift, but close enough that they appear as two separate peaks. And since each diastereomer contributes one peak, and they're in equal amounts, the integrals would add up to 1H. So that fits the NMR data.

So in that case, the LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass, because they're diastereomers but same molecular weight. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but then why would the NMR have two peaks for the same proton? Because each diastereomer's alpha proton is a bit different. So the integral for each would be 0.5H each, adding up to 1H. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, if it's a racemic mixture (option B), then both enantiomers would have the same shift for that alpha proton, so the NMR would just show a singlet. So that wouldn't explain the two peaks.

So I think the correct answer is D: the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton are observed, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together 1H).
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity are observed, with the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which would be evident in the mass spectrum. Since the mass spectrum matches the expected molecule, this is unlikely.
   - **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and typically produce a single peak in the NMR spectrum due to symmetry. If the sample were a racemic mixture, the alpha-proton would not split into two peaks, as both enantiomers would contribute to the same chemical environment. Thus, this does not explain the observed NMR data.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation)**: The term "double coupling" is unclear, but it does not align with the data. The NMR data suggests two distinct environments for the alpha-proton, which is more consistent with diastereomers than with coupling effects.
   - **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. In LC-MS, they would separate into two peaks with the same mass. In the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute a distinct peak for the alpha-proton due to differences in their environments. The two peaks with equal integrals (together 1H) are consistent with a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers, where each contributes half the signal for the alpha-proton.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two peaks in both the NMR and LC-MS data, as well as the equal integrals and masses observed.
