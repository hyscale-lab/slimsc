Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read through it again and think about how to approach it.

Alright, the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, but their periods are different. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 of 1 year. The observations are about the radial velocity (RV) variations of the stars in each system. For system_1, the RVs have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So we're comparing the total mass of both systems.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity, right? Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass in the center of mass system.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star can be related to the mass of the other star. Specifically, the mass of one star is proportional to the cube of their velocity amplitude divided by the cube of the orbital period, but I might be getting that mixed up. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, the mass function relates the velocities to the masses. The formula I recall is:

(M_2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_1 + M_2)^2 ) ) = ( (4π²) (P yr)^(-1) ) (K_1)^3 ) / (27 (1 - e²)^(3/2) )

But since we don't have eccentricity information, maybe we're assuming circular orbits, so e=0. That simplifies things because (1 - e²)^(3/2) becomes 1.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to consider that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes relate to the masses in a way that K is inversely proportional to the mass. Because the more massive star would orbit more slowly. So for a given orbital separation, lower mass stars move faster.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower.

The formula I remember is that the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So K1 / K2 = M2 / M1, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. Let's say M1 is the mass of star 1, M2 is the mass of star 2. The center of mass condition is M1 a1 = M2 a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. The orbital period is the same for both. So velocity is 2π a / P. So v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the two stars. Similarly for a2.

So v1 = (2π M2 a_total) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Similarly, v2 = (2π M1 a_total) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

So the ratio of v1 to v2 is M2 / M1.

Hmm, so v1 = (M2 / M1) * v2.

But wait, in the problem, in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So for system_1, the two stars have K1 =10 and K2=5.

So for system_1, K1/K2 = (10)/(5) = 2. But according to the formula I just thought of, K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1.

Wait, but wait, M1 + M2 is the total mass. So if M2 is twice M1, then M_total = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

So the mass function would involve this. But perhaps, since the problem is about the total mass, maybe we can find the ratio of the total masses for system_1 and system_2.

Wait, but each system is a binary, so each has two stars. Let's model each system.

For system_1: K1 =10, K2=5.

From K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 2.

So M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass for system_1, M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2: K1=15, K2=10.

K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2/M1 = 3/2 → M2 = (3/2) M1'.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, the K's are for each star. Let me think.

Wait, in system_2, it's their own masses. Let me denote the masses as M2a and M2b.

So in system_2, K2a / K2b = M2b / M2a = 15/10 = 3/2.

So M2b = (3/2) M2a.

So total mass of system_2 is M2a + M2b = M2a + (3/2 M2a) = (5/2) M2a.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 and system_2.

But how do I relate the masses to the periods?

Ah, the period comes in because the velocity depends on the period and the separation, but maybe I can find the ratio of the masses using the periods and the velocities.

Wait, another approach: the mass function. The mass function for each star in the binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing the inclination i, which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight, we can't get the exact mass. However, since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. Thus, we can assume i is 90 degrees, making sin i =1.

So for each star in the system, f(M) = (M^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But wait, how do I proceed from here? Let me think.

In binary systems, each star's mass can be found using the mass function. But in reality, you can only measure the mass function for one star, unless you have both velocities. But in this problem, both velocities are given for each system.

Wait, wait, for each system, we have the velocities of both stars. So perhaps we can find the ratio of their masses directly.

Because for each system, the total mass is M = M1 + M2, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars.

And from the velocities, for each system, we can find the ratio M2 / M1 = K1 / K2.

Wait, let me confirm.

In a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2 → M2/M1 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1.

Thus, M_total for system_1 is M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → K1/K2=3/2 → M2/M1=3/2 → M2 = (3/2) M1'.

So M_total = M1' + (3/2) M1' = (5/2) M1'.

Now, the question is to find how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. So (M_system1) / (M_system2) = [3 M1] / [ (5/2) M1' ].

But wait, how do we relate M1 and M1'? Because without knowing the actual separation or other parameters, perhaps we can relate the masses using the orbital period.

Wait, we have the periods. For system_1, the period is 2 years; for system_2, it's 1 year.

I remember that in binary systems, the orbital period and the separation are related through Kepler's third law. The formula is:

P^2 = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a_total^3) / (M_total)

Wait, wait, the correct form is P² = (4π²) (a³) / (G(M1 + M2)) )

But in astronomical units, when P is in years, a in AU, M in solar masses, the formula simplifies. But perhaps I can use the version that relates the period, the separation, and the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that combines the velocities and the period to find the mass.

Wait, let's think about the velocity of each star in the binary system. Each star's velocity is K1 and K2.

The velocity is given by K = 2π a / P * (M_other / M_total )

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, for each star, K = (2π a_i) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

And since M1 a1 = M2 a2 (center of mass condition), a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total.

But a_total is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2.

So, for each star, K = (2π a_i) / P.

So, K1 = (2π a1) / P = (2π (M2 a_total) ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Similarly, K2 = (2π a2) / P = (2π (M1 a_total) ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Let me rearrange this. Multiply both sides by P/(2π):

a1 = (K1 P) / (2π )

a2 = (K2 P) / (2π )

But also, a1 + a2 = a_total.

So a_total = (K1 P + K2 P)/(2π ) = ( (K1 + K2) P )/( 2π )

Now, the total mass M_total can be found using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a_total³) / (G M_total )

But substituting a_total from above:

P² = (4 π² [ ( (K1 + K2) P )/( 2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G M_total )

Let me compute this:

= (4 π² ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P )^3 / (8 π³) ) ] / ( G M_total )

Simplify:

= [4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / 8 π³ ] / ( G M_total )

Simplify numerator:

4/8 = 0.5. π² / π³ = 1/π.

So,

= [ 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / π ] / ( G M_total )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

P² * G M_total = 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / π

Divide both sides by P²:

G M_total = 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P / π

Rearrange for M_total:

M_total = [ 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

But wait, let's express this in terms of units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the ratio between the two systems.

Because we have two systems, system_1 and system_2, we can write the ratio of their total masses.

Let me denote:

For system_1: K1_1=10, K2_1=5, P1=2.

For system_2: K1_2=15, K2_2=10, P2=1.

Then, the total mass for each is M_total_1 and M_total_2.

From the formula above,

M_total = [0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

But since G and π are constants, the ratio of M_total_1 to M_total_2 would be:

(M_total_1)/(M_total_2) = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because all the other terms (0.5, π, G) cancel out when taking the ratio.

So let's compute this.

Compute numerator:

(K1_1 + K2_1) = 10 +5 =15. 15^3 = 3375.

P1 =2.

So numerator = 3375 * 2 = 6750.

Denominator:

(K1_2 + K2_2)=15+10=25. 25^3=15625.

P2=1.

Denominator=15625 * 1=15625.

So ratio = 6750 /15625.

Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

270/625.

Simplify: both divisible by 5.

270 ÷5=54; 625 ÷5=125.

54/125 = 0.432.

So the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2 = approx 0.432.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.432, that means system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. In other words, system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. So the factor would be approximately 0.43, which is 0.4 or 0.6? Wait, options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.432 is approximately 0.43, which is close to 0.4. So the factor would be about 0.4. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of 0.4.

Wait, but the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.4, that's system_1 is 0.4 times system_2. So system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is smaller, being 0.4 times.

So the factor would be 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, when I derived M_total, I had:

M_total = [0.5 (K1+K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

So when taking the ratio of M_total_1 to M_total_2, it's:

[ (K1+K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1+K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because 0.5 and π and G are same for both, and cancel when taking the ratio.

So that seems correct.

So for system_1: sum of K's is 15, P=2.

For system_2: sum is 25, P=1.

So the ratio is (15^3 *2) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2)/(15625 *1) = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than 0.43 is to 0.6.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the mass ratio is M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So the question is, how much more massive is system_1 than system_2. If system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be less than one. So the correct answer is 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the numbers.

15^3 = 3375. 3375 *2 =6750.

25^3=15625. 15625 *1=15625.

6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute 15625 ×0.4 =6250.

6750 is 500 more than 6250.

So 0.4 + (500/15625) = 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432.

So 0.432 is correct.

So the ratio is approximately 0.43. So the answer is option A, which is approximately 0.4.

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and use the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system masses.

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,1}} \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,2}} \)

3. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.5 \, (K_1 + K_2)^3 \, P}{\pi G}
   \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes, \( P \) is the orbital period, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant. Since \( G \) and \( \pi \) are constants, they cancel out when taking the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

### Ratio of Total Masses:
The ratio of the total masses is given by:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 \, P_1}{(K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 \, P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
- For system_1: \( K_{1,1} + K_{2,1} = 10 + 5 = 15 \), so \( (K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 = 15^3 = 3375 \), and \( P_1 = 2 \).
- For system_2: \( K_{1,2} + K_{2,2} = 15 + 10 = 25 \), so \( (K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 = 25^3 = 15625 \), and \( P_2 = 1 \).

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Interpretation:
The ratio \( M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 0.432 \), meaning system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to a factor of approximately **0.4**.

### Final Answer:
System_1 is about **0.4 times** as massive as system_2.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read through it again and think about how to approach it.

The observations are about the radial velocity (RV) variations of the stars in each system. For system_1, the RVs have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity, right? Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass in the center of mass system.

Wait, the mass function relates the velocities to the masses. The formula I recall is:

(M_2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_1 + M_2)^2 ) ) = ( (4π²) (P yr)^(-1) ) (K_1)^3 ) / (27 (1 - e²)^(3/2) )

But since we don't have eccentricity information, maybe we're assuming circular orbits, so e=0. That simplifies things because (1 - e²)^(3/2) becomes 1.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to consider that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes relate to the masses in a way that K is inversely proportional to the mass. Because the more massive star would orbit more slowly. So for a given orbital separation, lower mass stars move faster.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower.

The formula I remember is that the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So K1 / K2 = M2 / M1, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. Let's say M1 is the mass of star 1, M2 is the mass of star 2. The center of mass condition is M1 a1 = M2 a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. The orbital period is the same for both. So velocity is 2π a / P. So v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the two stars. Similarly for a2.

So v1 = (2π M2 a_total) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Similarly, v2 = (2π M1 a_total) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

So the ratio of v1 to v2 is M2 / M1.

Hmm, so v1 = (M2 / M1) * v2.

But wait, in the problem, in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So for system_1, the two stars have K1 =10 and K2=5.

So for system_1, K1/K2 = (10)/(5) = 2. But according to the formula I just thought of, K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1.

Wait, but wait, M1 + M2 is the total mass. So if M2 is twice M1, then M_total = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

So the mass function would involve this. But perhaps, since the problem is about the total mass, maybe we can find the ratio of the total masses for system_1 and system_2.

Wait, but each system is a binary, so each has two stars. Let's model each system.

For system_1: K1 =10, K2=5.

From K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 2.

So M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass for system_1, M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2: K1=15, K2=10.

K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2/M1 = 3/2 → M2 = (3/2) M1'.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, the K's are for each star. Let me think.

Wait, in system_2, it's their own masses. Let me denote the masses as M2a and M2b.

So in system_2, K2a / K2b = M2b / M2a = 15/10 = 3/2.

So M2b = (3/2) M2a.

So total mass of system_2 is M2a + M2b = M2a + (3/2 M2a) = (5/2) M2a.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 and system_2.

But how do I relate the masses to the periods?

Ah, the period comes in because the velocity depends on the period and the separation, but maybe I can find the ratio of the masses using the periods and the velocities.

Wait, another approach: the mass function. The mass function for each star in the binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing the inclination i, which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight, we can't get the exact mass. However, since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. Thus, we can assume i is 90 degrees, making sin i =1.

So for each star in the system, f(M) = (M^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But wait, how do I proceed from here? Let me think.

In binary systems, each star's mass can be found using the mass function. But in reality, you can only measure the mass function for one star, unless you have both velocities. But in this problem, both velocities are given for each system.

Wait, wait, for each system, we have the velocities of both stars. So perhaps we can find the ratio of their masses directly.

Because for each system, the total mass is M = M1 + M2, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars.

And from the velocities, for each system, we can find the ratio M2 / M1 = K1 / K2.

Wait, let me confirm.

In a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2 → M2/M1 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1.

Thus, M_total for system_1 is M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → K1/K2=3/2 → M2/M1=3/2 → M2 = (3/2) M1'.

So M_total = M1' + (3/2) M1' = (5/2) M1'.

Now, the question is to find how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. So (M_system1) / (M_system2) = [3 M1] / [ (5/2) M1' ].

But wait, how do we relate M1 and M1'? Because without knowing the actual separation or other parameters, perhaps we can relate the masses using the orbital period.

Wait, we have the periods. For system_1, the period is 2 years; for system_2, it's 1 year.

I remember that in binary systems, the orbital period and the separation are related through Kepler's third law. The formula is:

P^2 = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a_total^3) / (M_total)

Wait, wait, the correct form is P² = (4π²) (a³) / (G(M1 + M2)) )

But in astronomical units, when P is in years, a in AU, M in solar masses, the formula simplifies. But perhaps I can use the version that relates the period, the separation, and the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that combines the velocities and the period to find the mass.

Wait, let's think about the velocity of each star in the binary system. Each star's velocity is K1 and K2.

The velocity is given by K = 2π a / P * (M_other / M_total )

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, for each star, K = (2π a_i) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

And since M1 a1 = M2 a2 (center of mass condition), a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total.

But a_total is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2.

So, for each star, K = (2π a_i) / P.

So, K1 = (2π a1) / P = (2π (M2 a_total) ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Similarly, K2 = (2π a2) / P = (2π (M1 a_total) ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Let me rearrange this. Multiply both sides by P/(2π):

a1 = (K1 P) / (2π )

a2 = (K2 P) / (2π )

But also, a1 + a2 = a_total.

So a_total = (K1 P + K2 P)/(2π ) = ( (K1 + K2) P )/( 2π )

Now, the total mass M_total can be found using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a_total³) / (G M_total )

But substituting a_total from above:

P² = (4 π² [ ( (K1 + K2) P )/( 2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G M_total )

Let me compute this:

= (4 π² ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P )^3 / (8 π³) ) ] / ( G M_total )

Simplify:

= [4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / 8 π³ ] / ( G M_total )

Simplify numerator:

4/8 = 0.5. π² / π³ = 1/π.

So,

= [ 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / π ] / ( G M_total )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

P² * G M_total = 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / π

Divide both sides by P²:

G M_total = 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P / π

Rearrange for M_total:

M_total = [ 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

But wait, let's express this in terms of units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the ratio between the two systems.

Because we have two systems, system_1 and system_2, we can write the ratio of their total masses.

Let me denote:

For system_1: K1_1=10, K2_1=5, P1=2.

For system_2: K1_2=15, K2_2=10, P2=1.

Then, the total mass for each is M_total_1 and M_total_2.

From the formula above,

M_total = [0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

But since G and π are constants, the ratio of M_total_1 to M_total_2 would be:

(M_total_1)/(M_total_2) = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because all the other terms (0.5, π, G) cancel out when taking the ratio.

So let's compute this.

Compute numerator:

(K1_1 + K2_1) = 10 +5 =15. 15^3 = 3375.

P1 =2.

So numerator = 3375 * 2 = 6750.

Denominator:

(K1_2 + K2_2)=15+10=25. 25^3=15625.

P2=1.

Denominator=15625 * 1=15625.

So ratio = 6750 /15625.

Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

270/625.

Simplify: both divisible by 5.

270 ÷5=54; 625 ÷5=125.

54/125 = 0.432.

So the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2 = approx 0.432.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.432, that means system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. In other words, system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. So the factor would be approximately 0.43, which is 0.4 or 0.6? Wait, options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.432 is approximately 0.43, which is close to 0.4. So the factor would be about 0.4. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of 0.4.

Wait, but the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.4, that's system_1 is 0.4 times system_2. So system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is smaller, being 0.4 times.

So the factor would be 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, when I derived M_total, I had:

M_total = [0.5 (K1+K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

So when taking the ratio of M_total_1 to M_total_2, it's:

[ (K1+K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1+K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because 0.5 and π and G are same for both, and cancel when taking the ratio.

So that seems correct.

So for system_1: sum of K's is 15, P=2.

For system_2: sum is 25, P=1.

So the ratio is (15^3 *2) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2)/(15625 *1) = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than 0.43 is to 0.6.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the mass ratio is M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So the question is, how much more massive is system_1 than system_2. If system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be less than one. So the correct answer is 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the numbers.

15^3 = 3375. 3375 *2 =6750.

25^3=15625. 15625 *1=15625.

6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute 15625 ×0.4 =6250.

6750 is 500 more than 6250.

So 0.4 + (500/15625) = 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432.

So 0.432 is correct.

So the ratio is approximately 0.43. So the answer is option A, which is approximately 0.4.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and use the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system masses.

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,1}} \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,2}} \)

3. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.5 \, (K_1 + K_2)^3 \, P}{\pi G}
   \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes, \( P \) is the orbital period, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant. Since \( G \) and \( \pi \) are constants, they cancel out when taking the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

### Ratio of Total Masses:
The ratio of the total masses is given by:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 \, P_1}{(K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 \, P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
- For system_1: \( K_{1,1} + K_{2,1} = 10 + 5 = 15 \), so \( (K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 = 15^3 = 3375 \), and \( P_1 = 2 \).
- For system_2: \( K_{1,2} + K_{2,2} = 15 + 10 = 25 \), so \( (K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 = 25^3 = 15625 \), and \( P_2 = 1 \).

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Interpretation:
The ratio \( M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 0.432 \), meaning system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to a factor of approximately **0.4**.

### Final Answer:
System_1 is about **0.4 times** as massive as system_2.
