Okay, so I'm faced with this chemistry question about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves understanding different types of symmetry elements like mirror planes, axes of rotation, etc. 

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. From what I remember, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that cuts through the middle in a horizontal direction.

The options given are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. I think the structure is a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is like a CH2 connected to two methyl groups. So the molecule's structure is trigonal planar around boron, with each substituent being an isopropyl group.

Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have some symmetry. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis because each isopropyl is identical. So rotation by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane (σh)? I'm not sure. Wait, the molecule is likely trigonal planar, so maybe there are mirror planes. Wait, if it's trigonal planar, the molecule has a C3 axis (since all three are same) and three mirror planes that each pass through a B-O axis and the midpoint of each O-B-O bond? Or perhaps a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The C3h symmetry includes a horizontal mirror. For triisopropyl borate, the structure is trigonal planar. The boron is in the center, and each substituent is the same. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Now, for the mirror plane: would there be a horizontal mirror that reflects the molecule onto itself? If the molecule is symmetric such that looking from above, it's flat, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the central boron and the plane of the substituents. So if the substituents are all in the same plane, then yes, a horizontal mirror would exist. So triisopropyl borate might have C3h symmetry. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it has D3h symmetry, which would include more symmetry elements, but perhaps not. Wait, no, D3h would have more than just C3 and σh. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is similar to norbornane but with a bridge. Wait, no, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane amine. No, wait, correction: quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. So it has a bridge structure. Now, what is its symmetry? Quinuclidine is a chiral molecule, I think. Wait, no, maybe it's not. Because if the molecule is symmetric, it might not be chiral. Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a center of inversion. So it might have certain symmetry elements. But does it have a three-fold rotation axis? I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three bridges of two carbons each. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to 120-degree rotations? No, because each bridge is two carbons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it has a C2 axis. Wait, I'm not certain about this. Maybe I should move on to the other options and come back.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. Trifuran suggests three furan rings. The benzo part indicates a benzene ring fused with something. The numbering seems a bit complicated. Wait, the molecule is a trifuran system with benzene rings attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 as ketones. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how the symmetry works here. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe it has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's more planar, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic compound with a certain symmetry. I'm not too confident about this one.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene refers to a tricyclic benzene system, like three benzene rings fused in a certain way. So this molecule would have a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran system. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13 as ketones. Hmm, I'm trying to imagine the structure. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, with three benzene rings fused in a way that makes it symmetric. So if the trifuran is connected to this triphenylene, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is higher. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each molecule's symmetry.

Starting with triisopropyl borate (option C). It has three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So the molecule is symmetric around the boron. If you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. So that's the C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would reflect the molecule onto itself. Since all three substituents are the same and in the same plane, a mirror plane that lies in the plane of the substituents and passes through the boron should work. So σh would be present. Hence, C3h symmetry. So that would mean option C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry.

Now, quinuclidine (option D). Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a very symmetric structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis? Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane: each of the three bridges is two carbons. So the structure is symmetric with three-fold axis. Because each bridge is the same. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule maps onto itself. So it does have a C3 axis. What about a mirror plane? Quinuclidine is a non-chiral molecule because it has a center of inversion. Wait, no, actually, I think quinuclidine is actually chiral. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think: the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton itself is symmetric. So in quinuclidine, the amine group is attached in a way that allows the molecule to have a certain symmetry. Wait, if the substituent is in a symmetric position, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you have a bridge structure, the mirror plane would have to pass through the bridge, but perhaps it's not as straightforward. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a σh plane, but only a C3 axis. In that case, its symmetry would be C3, not C3h. So it wouldn't have the horizontal mirror plane needed for C3h.

Now, looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let me try to imagine the structure. It's a trifuran system (three furan rings) fused with a benzene ring. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused to one of the furan rings. The numbering is a bit complicated, but perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, it's possible that the molecule has a D3h symmetry because of the arrangement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a planar molecule with three similar substituents around a central point, leading to C3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure; it's a fused triphenylene group. So if the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. For instance, the trifuran could be attached at three symmetric positions of the triphenylene. So, the molecule would have a C3 axis. Would it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Triphenylene itself is symmetric, so maybe the mirror plane is present. So the molecule could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each option.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. We've discussed that it has a C3 axis and a σh plane, so C3h symmetry.

Option A: Maybe the molecule has a three-fold axis but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Since triphenylene is symmetric, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric in that way. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's symmetry is higher, like D3h or something else, but at least it would have C3h.

Wait, the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if both option C and option A have C3h symmetry, then I might be wrong. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a simple molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom. So yes, it should have a C3 axis and a σh plane. So option C is a candidate.

But wait, let me think about the other options again. Quinuclidine, option D, is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It's a very symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold rotation axis because each bridge is the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you look at the structure, it's symmetric with respect to a plane that passes through the central carbon. So perhaps quinuclidine has a σh plane. Wait, but wait, I thought it might not because of the bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it does.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure of quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a cage-like structure. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis along the line perpendicular to the three bridges. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal plane would pass through the central carbon and the centers of the opposite bridges. So if you imagine a plane cutting through the central carbon and the midpoints of the bridges, would that be a mirror plane? I think yes. Because each bridge is symmetric. So quinuclidine would have a C3 axis and a σh plane, hence C3h symmetry.

If that's the case, then both triisopropyl borate (option C) and quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry. But wait, that can't be right because each option is a choice, and the question gives four options, each labeled A to D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is actually a chiral molecule. Wait, no, no. Wait, it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is symmetric. So perhaps it's achiral. Wait, if it's symmetric, it can't be chiral. Because chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry. So if quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So it has C3h symmetry, which would mean it's not chiral. But I thought quinuclidine was a chiral molecule. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is actually achiral and has a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The structure of quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three equivalent bridges. So maybe it's symmetric, making it achiral. So that would support the idea that it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but if that's the case, both option C (triisopropyl borate) and option D (quinuclidine) have C3h symmetry. But the options can't both be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me think about the structures again. Triisopropyl borate: central B with three isopropyl groups. All substituents are same, so it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. Wait, the amine group is attached in a symmetric position. So the substituent is placed in a way that maintains symmetry. So perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, making it C3h symmetric.

But wait, the question gives four options, each with a different molecule. So perhaps only one of them has C3h. So maybe I'm wrong about quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno[...](option A) has C3h symmetry. Let me think about that. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure made of three benzene rings. If the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way to the triphenylene, perhaps the whole molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the benzo[...] (option B) has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each molecule's symmetry elements.

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, it has both.

Quinuclidine: I'm not sure. If it has both a C3 and σh, then yes.

But I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try to recall. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. It has a C3 axis (because three identical substituents) and three mirror planes, each containing the C-B axis and the midpoint of each substituent. But wait, perhaps the mirror planes are vertical. A horizontal mirror would pass through the central B atom and the midpoint between substituents. Wait, is that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is the plane where the substituents lie. If the molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane would be that plane. So yes, it has σh.

But for quinuclidine, the structure is more 3D. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the substituent is in a position that disrupts it.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane, making its symmetry C3 instead of C3h.

Wait, maybe I should look up the symmetry of these compounds. But since I can't do that right now, I need to think based on what I remember.

Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. It has a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. If the substituent is placed symmetrically, perhaps yes.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would require that the molecule's structure repeats every 120 degrees and that it's symmetric with a horizontal mirror. For triisopropyl borate, this is definitely the case.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. If the substituents are placed symmetrically, perhaps this molecule has C3h symmetry too. But I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenylene attached to a trifuran. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, perhaps this has C3h.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I remember that triisopropyl borate has a high degree of symmetry. Because all three substituents are same, it's symmetric. So it should have C3h symmetry.

As for quinuclidine, I might be wrong about it having C3h. Maybe it's D3h or another symmetry, but perhaps it's only C3. Or maybe it doesn't have σh.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]

B) benzo[...]

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the options are labeled A, B, C, D.

If C is triisopropyl borate, and I think it has C3h symmetry, then option C would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Quinuclidine's symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and three planes of symmetry, but perhaps no horizontal mirror plane. Because the structure is a cage, the mirror planes might be vertical.

Wait, if the molecule has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes, then it would have D3h symmetry, which is higher. But if it lacks a horizontal mirror plane, then its symmetry might be D3 instead of C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a center of inversion, so it's not chiral. But I'm not sure how that relates to C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: molecular symmetry and common compounds. Triisopropyl borate is a known compound. Does it have C3h symmetry? I think yes, because of the trigonal planar structure with three identical groups.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on the definition of C₃h symmetry, which includes a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Each option is evaluated as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene structure, and the trifuran is attached in a way that could introduce symmetry. However, the complexity of the structure makes it unclear if it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. While it may have some symmetry, there is insufficient evidence to confirm C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a trifuran system fused with a benzene ring. The structure is complex, and while it may have some symmetry, it is not clear if it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. The arrangement of the substituents and the fused rings does not definitively support C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, with a clear C₃ axis due to the identical substituents. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that lies in the plane of the substituents and passes through the boron atom. This satisfies the requirements for C₃h symmetry, making this molecule a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the three equivalent bridges. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is unclear. The molecule's 3D structure and the placement of the amine group suggest it may not have a σₕ plane, making it less likely to have C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the molecule that clearly exhibits C₃h symmetry, as it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. The other options either lack sufficient symmetry elements or their structures are too complex to confirm C₃h symmetry.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm faced with this chemistry question about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves understanding different types of symmetry elements like mirror planes, axes of rotation, etc. 

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. From what I remember, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that cuts through the middle in a horizontal direction.

The options given are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. I think the structure is a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is like a CH2 connected to two methyl groups. So the molecule's structure is trigonal planar around boron, with each substituent being an isopropyl group.

Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have some symmetry. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis because each isopropyl is identical. So rotation by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane (σh)? I'm not sure. Wait, the molecule is likely trigonal planar, so maybe there are mirror planes. Wait, if it's trigonal planar, the molecule has a C3 axis (since all three are same) and three mirror planes that each pass through a B-O axis and the midpoint of each O-B-O bond? Or perhaps a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The C3h symmetry includes a horizontal mirror. For triisopropyl borate, the structure is trigonal planar. The boron is in the center, and each substituent is the same. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Now, for the mirror plane: would there be a horizontal mirror that reflects the molecule onto itself? If the molecule is symmetric such that looking from above, it's flat, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the central boron and the plane of the substituents. So if the substituents are all in the same plane, then yes, a horizontal mirror would exist. So triisopropyl borate might have C3h symmetry. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it has D3h symmetry, which would include more symmetry elements, but perhaps not. Wait, no, D3h would have more than just C3 and σh. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is similar to norbornane but with a bridge. Wait, no, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane amine. No, wait, correction: quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. So it has a bridge structure. Now, what is its symmetry? Quinuclidine is a chiral molecule, I think. Wait, no, maybe it's not. Because if the molecule is symmetric, it might not be chiral. Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a center of inversion. So it might have certain symmetry elements. But does it have a three-fold rotation axis? I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three bridges of two carbons each. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to 120-degree rotations? No, because each bridge is two carbons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it has a C2 axis. Wait, I'm not certain about this. Maybe I should move on to the other options and come back.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. Trifuran suggests three furan rings. The benzo part indicates a benzene ring fused with something. The numbering seems a bit complicated. Wait, the molecule is a trifuran system with benzene rings attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 as ketones. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how the symmetry works here. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe it has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's more planar, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic compound with a certain symmetry. I'm not too confident about this one.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene refers to a tricyclic benzene system, like three benzene rings fused in a certain way. So this molecule would have a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran system. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13 as ketones. Hmm, I'm trying to imagine the structure. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, with three benzene rings fused in a way that makes it symmetric. So if the trifuran is connected to this triphenylene, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is higher. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each molecule's symmetry.

Starting with triisopropyl borate (option C). It has three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So the molecule is symmetric around the boron. If you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. So that's the C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would reflect the molecule onto itself. Since all three substituents are the same and in the same plane, a mirror plane that lies in the plane of the substituents and passes through the boron should work. So σh would be present. Hence, C3h symmetry. So that would mean option C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry.

Now, quinuclidine (option D). Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a very symmetric structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis? Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane: each of the three bridges is two carbons. So the structure is symmetric with three-fold axis. Because each bridge is the same. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule maps onto itself. So it does have a C3 axis. What about a mirror plane? Quinuclidine is a non-chiral molecule because it has a center of inversion. Wait, no, actually, I think quinuclidine is actually chiral. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think: the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton itself is symmetric. So in quinuclidine, the amine group is attached in a way that allows the molecule to have a certain symmetry. Wait, if the substituent is in a symmetric position, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you have a bridge structure, the mirror plane would have to pass through the bridge, but perhaps it's not as straightforward. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a σh plane, but only a C3 axis. In that case, its symmetry would be C3, not C3h. So it wouldn't have the horizontal mirror plane needed for C3h.

Now, looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let me try to imagine the structure. It's a trifuran system (three furan rings) fused with a benzene ring. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused to one of the furan rings. The numbering is a bit complicated, but perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, it's possible that the molecule has a D3h symmetry because of the arrangement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a planar molecule with three similar substituents around a central point, leading to C3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure; it's a fused triphenylene group. So if the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. For instance, the trifuran could be attached at three symmetric positions of the triphenylene. So, the molecule would have a C3 axis. Would it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Triphenylene itself is symmetric, so maybe the mirror plane is present. So the molecule could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each option.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. We've discussed that it has a C3 axis and a σh plane, so C3h symmetry.

Option A: Maybe the molecule has a three-fold axis but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Since triphenylene is symmetric, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric in that way. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's symmetry is higher, like D3h or something else, but at least it would have C3h.

Wait, the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if both option C and option A have C3h symmetry, then I might be wrong. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a simple molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom. So yes, it should have a C3 axis and a σh plane. So option C is a candidate.

But wait, let me think about the other options again. Quinuclidine, option D, is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It's a very symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold rotation axis because each bridge is the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you look at the structure, it's symmetric with respect to a plane that passes through the central carbon. So perhaps quinuclidine has a σh plane. Wait, but wait, I thought it might not because of the bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it does.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure of quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a cage-like structure. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis along the line perpendicular to the three bridges. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal plane would pass through the central carbon and the centers of the opposite bridges. So if you imagine a plane cutting through the central carbon and the midpoints of the bridges, would that be a mirror plane? I think yes. Because each bridge is symmetric. So quinuclidine would have a C3 axis and a σh plane, hence C3h symmetry.

If that's the case, then both triisopropyl borate (option C) and quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry. But wait, that can't be right because each option is a choice, and the question gives four options, each labeled A to D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is actually a chiral molecule. Wait, no, no. Wait, it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is symmetric. So perhaps it's achiral. Wait, if it's symmetric, it can't be chiral. Because chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry. So if quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So it has C3h symmetry, which would mean it's not chiral. But I thought quinuclidine was a chiral molecule. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is actually achiral and has a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The structure of quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three equivalent bridges. So maybe it's symmetric, making it achiral. So that would support the idea that it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but if that's the case, both option C (triisopropyl borate) and option D (quinuclidine) have C3h symmetry. But the options can't both be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me think about the structures again. Triisopropyl borate: central B with three isopropyl groups. All substituents are same, so it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. Wait, the amine group is attached in a symmetric position. So the substituent is placed in a way that maintains symmetry. So perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, making it C3h symmetric.

But wait, the question gives four options, each with a different molecule. So perhaps only one of them has C3h. So maybe I'm wrong about quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno[...](option A) has C3h symmetry. Let me think about that. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure made of three benzene rings. If the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way to the triphenylene, perhaps the whole molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the benzo[...] (option B) has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each molecule's symmetry elements.

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, it has both.

Quinuclidine: I'm not sure. If it has both a C3 and σh, then yes.

But I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try to recall. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. It has a C3 axis (because three identical substituents) and three mirror planes, each containing the C-B axis and the midpoint of each substituent. But wait, perhaps the mirror planes are vertical. A horizontal mirror would pass through the central B atom and the midpoint between substituents. Wait, is that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is the plane where the substituents lie. If the molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane would be that plane. So yes, it has σh.

But for quinuclidine, the structure is more 3D. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the substituent is in a position that disrupts it.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane, making its symmetry C3 instead of C3h.

Wait, maybe I should look up the symmetry of these compounds. But since I can't do that right now, I need to think based on what I remember.

Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. It has a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. If the substituent is placed symmetrically, perhaps yes.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would require that the molecule's structure repeats every 120 degrees and that it's symmetric with a horizontal mirror. For triisopropyl borate, this is definitely the case.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. If the substituents are placed symmetrically, perhaps this molecule has C3h symmetry too. But I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenylene attached to a trifuran. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, perhaps this has C3h.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I remember that triisopropyl borate has a high degree of symmetry. Because all three substituents are same, it's symmetric. So it should have C3h symmetry.

As for quinuclidine, I might be wrong about it having C3h. Maybe it's D3h or another symmetry, but perhaps it's only C3. Or maybe it doesn't have σh.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]

B) benzo[...]

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the options are labeled A, B, C, D.

If C is triisopropyl borate, and I think it has C3h symmetry, then option C would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Quinuclidine's symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and three planes of symmetry, but perhaps no horizontal mirror plane. Because the structure is a cage, the mirror planes might be vertical.

Wait, if the molecule has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes, then it would have D3h symmetry, which is higher. But if it lacks a horizontal mirror plane, then its symmetry might be D3 instead of C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a center of inversion, so it's not chiral. But I'm not sure how that relates to C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: molecular symmetry and common compounds. Triisopropyl borate is a known compound. Does it have C3h symmetry? I think yes, because of the trigonal planar structure with three identical groups.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on the definition of C₃h symmetry, which includes a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Each option is evaluated as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene structure, and the trifuran is attached in a way that could introduce symmetry. However, the complexity of the structure makes it unclear if it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. While it may have some symmetry, there is insufficient evidence to confirm C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a trifuran system fused with a benzene ring. The structure is complex, and while it may have some symmetry, it is not clear if it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. The arrangement of the substituents and the fused rings does not definitively support C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, with a clear C₃ axis due to the identical substituents. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that lies in the plane of the substituents and passes through the boron atom. This satisfies the requirements for C₃h symmetry, making this molecule a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the three equivalent bridges. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is unclear. The molecule's 3D structure and the placement of the amine group suggest it may not have a σₕ plane, making it less likely to have C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the molecule that clearly exhibits C₃h symmetry, as it has both a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane. The other options either lack sufficient symmetry elements or their structures are too complex to confirm C₃h symmetry.

**Answer: C**
