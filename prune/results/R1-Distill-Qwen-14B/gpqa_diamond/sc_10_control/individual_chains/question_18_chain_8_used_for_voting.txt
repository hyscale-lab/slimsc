Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, compared to each other.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. So, the stars have masses of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. 

Hmm, so I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star because the ratio would be [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So I think that would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2). But wait, since the question is about the ratio, that's (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) * (n_H1 /n_H2). But wait, but if the stars are assuming LTE and using EW method, maybe the H is the same in each? Or maybe we can assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which I think means that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio. Wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so n_Mg2 / n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

So let's start with Star_1. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the Fe abundance is solar. So Fe in Star 1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 - 12) = 10^(-4.5) or 3.16e-5. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait the way the problem states it: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Same for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =1e-5. So in the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0 by definition because it's the reference.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun). So log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but what is the solar ratio for Si/Fe? Because the problem gives us [Si/Fe]_1 as 0.3. So to find n_Si1 in terms of n_H1, I might need to relate it through Fe.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(n_Si1 /n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but the solar ratio is n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun. What's that value? I don't have that directly, but perhaps I can express it in terms of their solar abundances.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] = 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 is given, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for each star as [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1. Because [Si/H] is [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe]. Let me think about this.

Wait, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/H] = [Y/H] + [X/Y]. Because:

[X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun)
= [Y/H] + log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun)
= [Y/H] + [X/Y]

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex. So n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^(0.3) times the solar [Si/H]. Wait, no: because [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun). So if [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, then n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Wait, let's think numerically. Let me compute for the Sun:

n_Si_sun/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5) * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 3.16e-5.

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Wait, but perhaps I can get this from the given data.

Wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it from the given data for Star 2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun). Which implies that [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun = 1e-5 (from the Sun's data, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 => log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5, so nMg/nH=1e-5.

So n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But I'm not sure if that helps with Star_1's Si.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let's compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

So n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

But n_Si_sun/n_H_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) ) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 3.16e-5.

Wait, but I don't have n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of Star_2's data.

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, which is log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

So log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Wait, but since the stars may have the same H abundance as the Sun? Or no. Wait, [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, which for Fe implies that n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun. So for Star_1, the H abundance is the same as the Sun? Or perhaps it's the same as the Sun's ratio, but not necessarily the same number density. Because n_H could vary based on pressure, etc. Hmm, but when using [X/H], it's the logarithm of (n_X/n_H) relative to the Sun. So if [X/H] is 0, then n_X/n_H is the same as solar.

Wait, but the problem says [Fe/H]1=0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Which implies (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in terms of [Si/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think again about Star_1.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, so [Si/Fe] = log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) ) - log( (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) ) = 0.3 + log( (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ).

Which implies (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). Hmm, maybe I can find it from Star_2's data.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Which is log( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) ) - log( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

So (n_Mg2/n_Si2) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But for Star_2, n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

So n_Mg2 = (1e-5) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si2 /n_H2) *n_H2.

Wait, no, n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

Hmm, but I don't know [Si/H]_2. So perhaps I should instead express [Si/H] in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So,

(n_Mg_sun * n_H2)/(n_H_sun) ) / (n_Si2) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Simplify:

(n_Mg_sun * n_H2)/(n_H_sun * n_Si2) ) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Cancel n_Mg_sun:

n_H2/(n_H_sun * n_Si2) ) =10^0.3 * (1/n_Si_sun).

Rearrange:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun) ) * ( n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

Hmm, but I also know that for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's think about n_Si2 in terms of [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si2/n_H2) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log( (n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H_sun /n_Si_sun) )

But n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find [Si/H]_2 using the given data for Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

We can write [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] + some factor. Wait, because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] + [H/H], but [H/H] is zero. Wait, no, because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is zero, so 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2. That implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check that formula.

Wait, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]. Because:

[X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun)
= (log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun)) ) - (log(n_Y/n_H) - log(n_Y_sun/n_H_sun)) )
= [X/H] - [Y/H]

So yes, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Given [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, then 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Now, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, as we found earlier.

So now, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1/n_H1) divided by (n_Si2/n_H2).

Because the ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

Wait no, no, wait. The ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 /n_H2) ) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But wait, the thing is, the hydrogen in each star's photosphere could be different. How do I handle that?

Wait, the problem doesn't give [H/Fe] for either star, so perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both? Or perhaps that the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1? That seems a big assumption, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: [X/H] is defined with respect to the Sun's [X/H], so [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(n_Si2/n_H2) =-0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} } → because:

(n_Si1/n_H1) =10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

(n_Si2/n_H2) =10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

So the ratio is (10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)) ) / (10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but that would be the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} = approximately 3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which I think is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Wait, no, because (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2) )

But wait, the ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1) )

Hmm. But without knowing n_H2/n_H1, I can't compute that.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, if Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given, but perhaps we can assume that the H abundance is the same for both stars?

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance (n_H) can be found from the total metallicity, but I don't have that information. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then n_H1 =n_H2, so the ratio becomes (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 ). And if n_H2 =n_H1, then it's (n_Si1/n_Si2) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98. So the ratio would be approximately 4, which corresponds to option A: ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me re-calculate 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is the same as e^(0.6 * ln 10) ≈ e^(0.6 * 2.302585) ≈ e^1.38155 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio would be approximately 4.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, so n_Si1 =10^{0.3} * n_Si_sun.

Wait, no, because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) =0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 =10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Thus, (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)] / [10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)] ) =10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

But this gives the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ), which is the same as (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But I don't know the n_H2/n_H1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of H is the same in both stars, meaning n_H1 =n_H2. Because if [Fe/H]_1=0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] could be different. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide [Fe/H] for Star_2, so perhaps it's supposed to assume that the H abundance is the same, i.e., n_H1 =n_H2.

If that's the case, then (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/(n_Si2/n_H2 * n_H2)) ) → Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, if n_H1 =n_H2, then (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1) ) → but if n_H2 =n_H1, then it's (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio would be about 3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2=-0.3.

Thus, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But if the H is the same in both stars, then the ratio of Si is 3.98.

But I'm not entirely confident because I might have overlooked some aspect. Let me check the options again. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

So the most likely option would be A, which is about 4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between them.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0, meaning the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, meaning the silicon-to-iron ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe], we find [Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0, meaning the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, meaning the magnesium-to-silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we solve for [Si/H]_2:
     \[
     0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
     \]

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - The Sun's silicon-to-hydrogen abundance is not explicitly provided, but it cancels out in the ratio calculation.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Using the relationships:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2},
\]
we find:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]
Substituting [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, compared to each other.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. So, the stars have masses of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. 

Hmm, so I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star because the ratio would be [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So I think that would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2). But wait, since the question is about the ratio, that's (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) * (n_H1 /n_H2). But wait, but if the stars are assuming LTE and using EW method, maybe the H is the same in each? Or maybe we can assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which I think means that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio. Wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so n_Mg2 / n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

So let's start with Star_1. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the Fe abundance is solar. So Fe in Star 1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 - 12) = 10^(-4.5) or 3.16e-5. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait the way the problem states it: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Same for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =1e-5. So in the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0 by definition because it's the reference.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun). So log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but what is the solar ratio for Si/Fe? Because the problem gives us [Si/Fe]_1 as 0.3. So to find n_Si1 in terms of n_H1, I might need to relate it through Fe.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(n_Si1 /n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but the solar ratio is n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun. What's that value? I don't have that directly, but perhaps I can express it in terms of their solar abundances.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] = 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 is given, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for each star as [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1. Because [Si/H] is [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe]. Let me think about this.

Wait, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/H] = [Y/H] + [X/Y]. Because:

[X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun)
= [Y/H] + log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun)
= [Y/H] + [X/Y]

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex. So n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^(0.3) times the solar [Si/H]. Wait, no: because [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun). So if [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, then n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Wait, let's think numerically. Let me compute for the Sun:

n_Si_sun/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5) * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 3.16e-5.

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Wait, but perhaps I can get this from the given data.

Wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it from the given data for Star 2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun). Which implies that [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun = 1e-5 (from the Sun's data, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 => log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5, so nMg/nH=1e-5.

So n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But I'm not sure if that helps with Star_1's Si.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let's compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

So n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

But n_Si_sun/n_H_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) ) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 3.16e-5.

Wait, but I don't have n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of Star_2's data.

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, which is log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

So log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Wait, but since the stars may have the same H abundance as the Sun? Or no. Wait, [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, which for Fe implies that n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun. So for Star_1, the H abundance is the same as the Sun? Or perhaps it's the same as the Sun's ratio, but not necessarily the same number density. Because n_H could vary based on pressure, etc. Hmm, but when using [X/H], it's the logarithm of (n_X/n_H) relative to the Sun. So if [X/H] is 0, then n_X/n_H is the same as solar.

Wait, but the problem says [Fe/H]1=0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Which implies (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in terms of [Si/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think again about Star_1.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, so [Si/Fe] = log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) ) - log( (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) ) = 0.3 + log( (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ).

Which implies (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). Hmm, maybe I can find it from Star_2's data.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Which is log( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) ) - log( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

So (n_Mg2/n_Si2) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But for Star_2, n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

So n_Mg2 = (1e-5) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si2 /n_H2) *n_H2.

Wait, no, n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

Hmm, but I don't know [Si/H]_2. So perhaps I should instead express [Si/H] in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So,

(n_Mg_sun * n_H2)/(n_H_sun) ) / (n_Si2) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Simplify:

(n_Mg_sun * n_H2)/(n_H_sun * n_Si2) ) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Cancel n_Mg_sun:

n_H2/(n_H_sun * n_Si2) ) =10^0.3 * (1/n_Si_sun).

Rearrange:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun) ) * ( n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

Hmm, but I also know that for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's think about n_Si2 in terms of [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si2/n_H2) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log( (n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H_sun /n_Si_sun) )

But n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find [Si/H]_2 using the given data for Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

We can write [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] + some factor. Wait, because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] + [H/H], but [H/H] is zero. Wait, no, because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is zero, so 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2. That implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check that formula.

Wait, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]. Because:

[X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun)
= (log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun)) ) - (log(n_Y/n_H) - log(n_Y_sun/n_H_sun)) )
= [X/H] - [Y/H]

So yes, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Given [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0, then 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Now, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, as we found earlier.

So now, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1/n_H1) divided by (n_Si2/n_H2).

Because the ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

Wait no, no, wait. The ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 /n_H2) ) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But wait, the thing is, the hydrogen in each star's photosphere could be different. How do I handle that?

Wait, the problem doesn't give [H/Fe] for either star, so perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both? Or perhaps that the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1? That seems a big assumption, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: [X/H] is defined with respect to the Sun's [X/H], so [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(n_Si2/n_H2) =-0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} } → because:

(n_Si1/n_H1) =10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

(n_Si2/n_H2) =10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

So the ratio is (10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)) ) / (10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but that would be the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} = approximately 3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which I think is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Wait, no, because (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2) )

But wait, the ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1) )

Hmm. But without knowing n_H2/n_H1, I can't compute that.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, if Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given, but perhaps we can assume that the H abundance is the same for both stars?

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance (n_H) can be found from the total metallicity, but I don't have that information. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then n_H1 =n_H2, so the ratio becomes (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 ). And if n_H2 =n_H1, then it's (n_Si1/n_Si2) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98. So the ratio would be approximately 4, which corresponds to option A: ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me re-calculate 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is the same as e^(0.6 * ln 10) ≈ e^(0.6 * 2.302585) ≈ e^1.38155 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio would be approximately 4.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, so n_Si1 =10^{0.3} * n_Si_sun.

Wait, no, because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) =0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 =10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Thus, (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)] / [10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)] ) =10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

But this gives the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ), which is the same as (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But I don't know the n_H2/n_H1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of H is the same in both stars, meaning n_H1 =n_H2. Because if [Fe/H]_1=0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] could be different. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide [Fe/H] for Star_2, so perhaps it's supposed to assume that the H abundance is the same, i.e., n_H1 =n_H2.

If that's the case, then (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/(n_Si2/n_H2 * n_H2)) ) → Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, if n_H1 =n_H2, then (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1) ) → but if n_H2 =n_H1, then it's (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio would be about 3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2=-0.3.

Thus, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But if the H is the same in both stars, then the ratio of Si is 3.98.

But I'm not entirely confident because I might have overlooked some aspect. Let me check the options again. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

So the most likely option would be A, which is about 4.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between them.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0, meaning the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, meaning the silicon-to-iron ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe], we find [Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0, meaning the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, meaning the magnesium-to-silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we solve for [Si/H]_2:
     \[
     0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
     \]

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - The Sun's silicon-to-hydrogen abundance is not explicitly provided, but it cancels out in the ratio calculation.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Using the relationships:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2},
\]
we find:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]
Substituting [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
