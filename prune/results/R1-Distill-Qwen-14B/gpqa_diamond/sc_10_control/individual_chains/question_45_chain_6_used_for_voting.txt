Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level for a single particle would be proportional to n² times E, right?

Wait, right, each particle in a 1D infinite well has energy levels E_n = (n²)E, where n is the quantum number (n=1,2,3...). But since we're dealing with four particles, and they're identical fermions (because they're spin-1/2), I have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must occupy a unique quantum state.

But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, they have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin-up and spin-down). That allows for two particles in each n level, right? Because each can have different spins.

Hmm, so for four particles, I need to find the lowest energy configuration (ground state), then the first and second excited states.

Ground state: For the lowest energy, all particles want to be in the lowest possible n's. Since each n can hold two particles (due to spin), let's see.

n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down), n=2 can hold another 2. So all four can fit into n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait, there are four particles. So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2. Each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1²)=E. Each in n=2 has E*(2²)=4E.

Wait, so the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles at E and two at 4E.

So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. No, because each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles, two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So total E is 2E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Because perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the ground state should have the lowest possible energy. So if all four particles were in the lowest possible states, that would be as I said earlier: two in n=1 and two in n=2. So total energy is 10E. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E. Option C's ground state is 4E as well. Hmm. So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I've miscounted. Wait, each n can hold two particles because of spin. So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → energy 1²E each, so 2E total.

n=2: 2 particles → 2²E each, so 2*(4E) =8E.

Total: 2E +8E =10E. That's correct. So the ground state energy is 10E. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 10E as the ground state. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option B says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, and second excited 50E. Option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the particles are not allowed to all be in n=1 and n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, so four would fit into n=1 and n=2. So the ground state would have total energy 10E.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any option with the ground state as 10E. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, so option D has ground state 10E, which fits my calculation. But wait, why would option B have ground state 4E? That can't be right because 4E would be if all four were in n=1, which is impossible because n=1 can only hold two particles.

Oh, wait, that's a mistake. So in the ground state, you can only have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the ground state energy is 10E, which is option D's first value. So look at option D: ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but wait. How do the excited states work here? Let's think about the first excited state. To find the first excited state, we need to promote the system to the next lowest energy configuration after the ground state.

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). To get the first excited state, we promote one particle to the next available state. But what's the next available state?

Wait, the next state after n=2 is n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, perhaps in the first excited state, one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but wait no, because n=2 has two particles already.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think more carefully.

The ground state configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). The next possible state (first excited) would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=3 can hold two particles. So maybe after ground state, the first excited state would have three particles in n=2 and one in n=1 and one in n=3? No, that can't be because each n can hold two.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the possible states. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles, spin up and down), n=2 (2 particles, spin up and down).

The next possible state (first excited) would involve moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, but wait, if you have two in n=2, you can't have three. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. But wait, n=3 can hold two particles, so perhaps in the first excited state, you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? No, wait, because each n can hold two, so maybe in the first excited state, you have two in n=2, and two in n=3.

Wait, no, that's higher energy than the ground state. Let me think: the ground state is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). The next possible state would be to have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2, but that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two. So the next option is to have two in n=1, two in n=3. But that's higher energy than the current ground state.

Wait, but that may not be the first excited state. Maybe another configuration is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but you can't because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state would be when one particle is in n=3, with two in n=2 and one in n=1. But wait, no, n=1 can only hold two, so in that case, you can't have three in n=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the possible configurations.

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total energy 10E.

First excited state: perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, n=2 can hold two, so why would only one be there? Wait, maybe I'm not considering the correct filling.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the particles filling the next available state. So after n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), the next lowest state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 goes to n=3, making the configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would sum to four particles. But wait, each n can have two, so perhaps the first excited state is when you have two in n=1, two in n=3. But that's higher in energy than ground state.

Wait, no, because in that case, the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E, which is higher than the ground state's 10E. But that's not possible because the first excited state must be higher than the ground state but not necessarily the next possible sum.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the first excited state occurs when we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But how is that possible when n=2 can hold two? Oh, wait, no, because each n can have two particles (due to spin), so in that case, n=2 could have two, but if one has been promoted to n=3, then n=2 would have one less. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that would sum to four. But in this case, the total energy would be 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. That's higher than the ground state's 10E. So that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait, no, because n=2 and n=3 can each hold two particles. So in the ground state, we have two in n=1 and two in n=2. For the first excited state, perhaps instead of having two in n=2, we have one in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would mean that n=2 only has one, which is allowed. Wait, but since each n can hold two, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the first excited state would have the particles arranged as two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but that's not possible because n=3 can hold two, but that would require more particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two in n=3. Then the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 2*(9E) (n=3) = 2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than the ground state's 10E, but would that be the first excited state?

Wait, but maybe the particles can be arranged in a way that some are promoted, but the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the first excited state has one particle in n=3, but then two in n=2 as well. Let me think: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0). If one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 would have one, n=3 would have one. But each cannot have more than two, but that's okay. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy would be 2E + 4E*(1) +9E*(1) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, that's higher than 10E, so that's possible.

So ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E. Now, the second excited state would be the next higher configuration. So perhaps in the second excited state, two particles are in n=3, and the others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but let me think. After the first excited state at 15E, the next would be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two in n=3, but wait, that would require two particles in n=3, which would add 2*(9E) =18E. But then, what about the others?

Wait, if we have two in n=3, and two in n=1, the total energy would be 2E + 2*9E= 2E+18E=20E. But another possibility is that in the second excited state, we have two in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. Let's see: 2*(4E) + 9E + 16E = 8E +9E +16E=33E. That's higher than 20E. So 20E would be the second excited state.

Wait, but what's the correct order? Let me think again.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state: moving one from n=2 to n=3: total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state: perhaps moving another from n=2 to n=3, but n=2 can only hold two, so perhaps the second excited state would have two in n=3, and the rest in lower states.

Wait, in the ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.

First excited state (15E): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

Second excited state: perhaps 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

So the options would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the configurations. Let me try a different approach. Let's list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The possible configurations for four particles with n and spin:

Since each n can have two particles, the lowest energy is when we fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): energy 2E + 2*(4E) =10E.

Next, the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Next, the second excited state: perhaps another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=2 has 0 particles, and n=3 has 2. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. But that's not matching any options provided.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm. So I'm getting 20E, but option D says 18E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait another thought. Maybe the first excited state isn't 15E. Perhaps I'm missing a lower energy configuration. Let me think: could the first excited state have one particle in n=2 and another in n=3, but arranged differently?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), but that's the ground state. So when you excite one particle from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), which gives 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so two in n=3 and zero in n=2, giving 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another possibility: Maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but rather another configuration. For example, perhaps we have one particle in n=2, another in n=3, and perhaps another in a higher state, but that would result in higher energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be when you have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, giving 2E (from n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) + 16E (n=4) → but wait, that would require four particles in different ns, but we have four particles. Wait, no, because if two are in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4, the total energy would be 2E +9E +16E = 27E, which is higher than 20E. So that can't be the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. That would give 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But none of the options have 20E. Option D says second excited is 18E.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the possible configurations. Let me think about the possible energies and how they add up.

Another approach: the possible configurations for four particles (each with spin up or down) must follow the Pauli exclusion. So each n can have up to two particles. Let me list all possible total energies for four particles, in order.

The ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's.

Configuration 1: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 2E + 2*4E =10E.

Configuration 2: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → energy 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Configuration 3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 2E + 2*9E=20E.

Configuration 4: n=2 (2), n=3 (2) → 2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E.

But wait, perhaps there's another configuration in between. What about n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1)? That would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. That's higher than 20E.

Another possibility: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), but that's the ground state. So after configuration 2 (15E), the next is configuration 3 (20E), then configuration 4 (26E).

But none of the options match 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the possible configurations.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Ah, 18E is 2*9E + ... Wait, 2*(9E) is 18E. So perhaps configuration 3 is 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E. But 18E alone would require two particles in n=3. So perhaps configuration 3 is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), which gives 20E.

But wait, the second excited state in that case would be 20E, not 18E. So perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state has two particles in n=2 and two in n=3, giving 2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than the 15E I thought earlier. So that can't be the first excited state.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible options. Looking back, the options are:

A) 30, 39,50

B)4,10,50

C)4,10,15

D)10,15,18.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ground state is 10E, which matches option D. Then the first excited state is 15E, which is option D's first excited. The second excited state in option D is 18E. So how could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require four particles. Let's see:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E.

n=3: 2 particles → 2*(9E)=18E.

Total: 2E+18E=20E.

But that's not matching 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So no.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2, but that would give 2*4E + 2*9E =8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 20E.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible states. Let me think again. Perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but what about the second excited state? Maybe another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. Then the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the energy would be 2E + 9E +16E=27E. But that's higher than the earlier 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). That's 2E +18E=20E.

So the options don't have 20E, but Option D's second excited is 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). But wait, we have four particles. n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1, n=4 has 1. Wait, but that's four particles. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E =31E. Which is higher than 20E.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible ground, first, and second excited states.

Ground State: 10E.

First Excited State:15E.

Second Excited State: perhaps 18E, which would be when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, because 2*(9E) +2*(1E) =18E +2E=20E. But I'm not getting that. Alternatively, perhaps it's when one is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would give 9E +16E=25E, which isn't 18E.

Wait a minute, perhaps the second excited state is 18E. How can that happen? Let me see: 18E is 2*(9E). So that would imply two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the total energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. That's 20E, not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that's 4E +9E=13E. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the energies are calculated. Let me re-express the possible configurations.

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first), 20E (second). But looking at the options, none have 20E as the second excited state. So perhaps the correct option is option D, which says ground is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E. But how?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a configuration where the second excited state is 18E. Let me think: 18E is 2*(9E), which would mean two particles in n=3, but perhaps in a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, but that would be 2*(9E) + 2*(16E)= 18E +32E=50E, which is option A's third state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and others in lower states, but that would require higher energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the possible configurations and the actual second excited state is 18E, which would imply that the configuration is two particles in n=3 and zero in n=2. But that would require n=3 to have two, which would give 18E plus the two in n=1, giving 20E. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a possible configuration where the total energy is 18E. Let me think: 18E could be 2*9E, which would require two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Which gives 2E + 18E=20E. So that's not 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me list all possible configurations with four particles, each in unique quantum states, and calculate their energies.

Configuration 1: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 10E.

Configuration 2: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Configuration 3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 2E + 18E=20E.

Configuration 4: n=2 (2), n=3 (2) → 8E + 18E=26E.

Configuration 5: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1) → 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Configuration 6: n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1) →2E+9E +16E=27E.

Configuration 7: n=2 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1) →8E +9E +16E=33E.

Configuration 8: n=1 (2), n=4 (2) →2E + 32E=34E.

Wait, but let me organize these energies in order:

10E → ground state.

15E → first excited.

20E → next.

22E.

26E.

27E.

33E.

34E.

So the second excited state would be 20E, which isn't an option. But the options don't have 20E as an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way the excited states are defined.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when another particle is promoted, but in a way that the total energy is lower than 20E. But I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Maybe I'm missing a configuration where the first excited state is lower than 15E.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the particles are arranged in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), giving 15E. The next state would be when two particles are in n=3, leading to 20E. So the second excited state is 20E.

But looking at the options, only option D has ground state 10E and first excited state 15E. Its second excited state is 18E, which doesn't match 20E. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way the particles are filled. Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't when one particle is promoted to n=3, but perhaps another configuration where the energy is lower. But I can't see any such configuration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are fermions, and in the first excited state, one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but the spin state changes somehow. But that wouldn't affect the energy because the energy depends only on n.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the ground state is 10E, the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 20E. But since none of the options have 20E as the second state, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking back at the options, option D says second excited is 18E, which would imply that the configuration is two particles in n=3, but the total energy would be 18E plus the rest.

Wait, if two particles are in n=3, that's 18E. But if the other two are in n=1, that's 2E. So total is 20E. So perhaps my initial assumption about the second excited state being 20E is correct, but the options don't have that. So maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake, and the second excited state is 18E, which would require that the configuration is one particle in n=3 and others in lower states, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the energies for each individual particle and then summing, but I think I'm doing that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option D: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But I'm not seeing how to get 18E as the second excited state.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two are in n=4. That would give 2*(9E) + 2*(16E) = 18E +32E=50E, which is option A's third state. But that can't be the second excited state, as it's higher than 20E.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct option is D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, but how? Because I can't see how the second excited state is 18E. Unless I'm missing a configuration where the energy is 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require the configuration to have n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1), which totals 2E +9E +16E=27E. That's higher than 20E.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should go with the option that matches the ground and first excited states I calculated, which is option D.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy levels for a single particle are given by:
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]
   Each quantum number \(n\) corresponds to a distinct energy level.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each \(n\) can hold up to two particles (due to spin up and spin down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**: The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest available energy levels. For four particles:
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=2\) (2 particles, energy \(E_2 = 4E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**: The next lowest energy configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\):
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=2\) (1 particle, energy \(E_2 = 4E\)),
   - \(n=3\) (1 particle, energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**: The next configuration is obtained by promoting another particle from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), resulting in:
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=3\) (2 particles, energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected configuration-based progression.
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of \(4E\) is incorrect, as the minimum energy for four particles is \(10E\).
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy of \(4E\) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option B.
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: The ground state energy of \(10E\) and the first excited state energy of \(15E\) match the calculations. However, the second excited state energy of \(18E\) does not align with the calculated \(20E\). Despite this discrepancy, Option D is the closest match to the calculated values.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most consistent option with the calculated ground and first excited states is **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level for a single particle would be proportional to n² times E, right?

Wait, right, each particle in a 1D infinite well has energy levels E_n = (n²)E, where n is the quantum number (n=1,2,3...). But since we're dealing with four particles, and they're identical fermions (because they're spin-1/2), I have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must occupy a unique quantum state.

But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, they have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin-up and spin-down). That allows for two particles in each n level, right? Because each can have different spins.

Hmm, so for four particles, I need to find the lowest energy configuration (ground state), then the first and second excited states.

Ground state: For the lowest energy, all particles want to be in the lowest possible n's. Since each n can hold two particles (due to spin), let's see.

n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down), n=2 can hold another 2. So all four can fit into n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait, there are four particles. So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2. Each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1²)=E. Each in n=2 has E*(2²)=4E.

Wait, so the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles at E and two at 4E.

So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. No, because each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles, two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So total E is 2E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Because perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the ground state should have the lowest possible energy. So if all four particles were in the lowest possible states, that would be as I said earlier: two in n=1 and two in n=2. So total energy is 10E. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E. Option C's ground state is 4E as well. Hmm. So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I've miscounted. Wait, each n can hold two particles because of spin. So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → energy 1²E each, so 2E total.

n=2: 2 particles → 2²E each, so 2*(4E) =8E.

Total: 2E +8E =10E. That's correct. So the ground state energy is 10E. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 10E as the ground state. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option B says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, and second excited 50E. Option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the particles are not allowed to all be in n=1 and n=2? Because each n can hold two particles, so four would fit into n=1 and n=2. So the ground state would have total energy 10E.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any option with the ground state as 10E. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, so option D has ground state 10E, which fits my calculation. But wait, why would option B have ground state 4E? That can't be right because 4E would be if all four were in n=1, which is impossible because n=1 can only hold two particles.

Oh, wait, that's a mistake. So in the ground state, you can only have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the ground state energy is 10E, which is option D's first value. So look at option D: ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but wait. How do the excited states work here? Let's think about the first excited state. To find the first excited state, we need to promote the system to the next lowest energy configuration after the ground state.

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). To get the first excited state, we promote one particle to the next available state. But what's the next available state?

Wait, the next state after n=2 is n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, perhaps in the first excited state, one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but wait no, because n=2 has two particles already.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think more carefully.

The ground state configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). The next possible state (first excited) would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=3 can hold two particles. So maybe after ground state, the first excited state would have three particles in n=2 and one in n=1 and one in n=3? No, that can't be because each n can hold two.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the possible states. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles, spin up and down), n=2 (2 particles, spin up and down).

The next possible state (first excited) would involve moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, but wait, if you have two in n=2, you can't have three. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. But wait, n=3 can hold two particles, so perhaps in the first excited state, you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? No, wait, because each n can hold two, so maybe in the first excited state, you have two in n=2, and two in n=3.

Wait, no, that's higher energy than the ground state. Let me think: the ground state is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). The next possible state would be to have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2, but that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two. So the next option is to have two in n=1, two in n=3. But that's higher energy than the current ground state.

Wait, but that may not be the first excited state. Maybe another configuration is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but you can't because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state would be when one particle is in n=3, with two in n=2 and one in n=1. But wait, no, n=1 can only hold two, so in that case, you can't have three in n=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the possible configurations.

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total energy 10E.

First excited state: perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, n=2 can hold two, so why would only one be there? Wait, maybe I'm not considering the correct filling.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the particles filling the next available state. So after n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), the next lowest state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 goes to n=3, making the configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would sum to four particles. But wait, each n can have two, so perhaps the first excited state is when you have two in n=1, two in n=3. But that's higher in energy than ground state.

Wait, no, because in that case, the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E, which is higher than the ground state's 10E. But that's not possible because the first excited state must be higher than the ground state but not necessarily the next possible sum.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the first excited state occurs when we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But how is that possible when n=2 can hold two? Oh, wait, no, because each n can have two particles (due to spin), so in that case, n=2 could have two, but if one has been promoted to n=3, then n=2 would have one less. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that would sum to four. But in this case, the total energy would be 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. That's higher than the ground state's 10E. So that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait, no, because n=2 and n=3 can each hold two particles. So in the ground state, we have two in n=1 and two in n=2. For the first excited state, perhaps instead of having two in n=2, we have one in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would mean that n=2 only has one, which is allowed. Wait, but since each n can hold two, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the first excited state would have the particles arranged as two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but that's not possible because n=3 can hold two, but that would require more particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two in n=3. Then the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 2*(9E) (n=3) = 2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than the ground state's 10E, but would that be the first excited state?

Wait, but maybe the particles can be arranged in a way that some are promoted, but the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the first excited state has one particle in n=3, but then two in n=2 as well. Let me think: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0). If one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 would have one, n=3 would have one. But each cannot have more than two, but that's okay. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy would be 2E + 4E*(1) +9E*(1) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, that's higher than 10E, so that's possible.

So ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E. Now, the second excited state would be the next higher configuration. So perhaps in the second excited state, two particles are in n=3, and the others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but let me think. After the first excited state at 15E, the next would be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two in n=3, but wait, that would require two particles in n=3, which would add 2*(9E) =18E. But then, what about the others?

Wait, if we have two in n=3, and two in n=1, the total energy would be 2E + 2*9E= 2E+18E=20E. But another possibility is that in the second excited state, we have two in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. Let's see: 2*(4E) + 9E + 16E = 8E +9E +16E=33E. That's higher than 20E. So 20E would be the second excited state.

Wait, but what's the correct order? Let me think again.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state: moving one from n=2 to n=3: total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state: perhaps moving another from n=2 to n=3, but n=2 can only hold two, so perhaps the second excited state would have two in n=3, and the rest in lower states.

Wait, in the ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.

First excited state (15E): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

Second excited state: perhaps 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

So the options would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the configurations. Let me try a different approach. Let's list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The possible configurations for four particles with n and spin:

Since each n can have two particles, the lowest energy is when we fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): energy 2E + 2*(4E) =10E.

Next, the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Next, the second excited state: perhaps another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=2 has 0 particles, and n=3 has 2. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. But that's not matching any options provided.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm. So I'm getting 20E, but option D says 18E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait another thought. Maybe the first excited state isn't 15E. Perhaps I'm missing a lower energy configuration. Let me think: could the first excited state have one particle in n=2 and another in n=3, but arranged differently?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), but that's the ground state. So when you excite one particle from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), which gives 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so two in n=3 and zero in n=2, giving 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another possibility: Maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but rather another configuration. For example, perhaps we have one particle in n=2, another in n=3, and perhaps another in a higher state, but that would result in higher energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be when you have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, giving 2E (from n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) + 16E (n=4) → but wait, that would require four particles in different ns, but we have four particles. Wait, no, because if two are in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4, the total energy would be 2E +9E +16E = 27E, which is higher than 20E. So that can't be the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. That would give 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. But none of the options have 20E. Option D says second excited is 18E.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the possible configurations. Let me think about the possible energies and how they add up.

Another approach: the possible configurations for four particles (each with spin up or down) must follow the Pauli exclusion. So each n can have up to two particles. Let me list all possible total energies for four particles, in order.

The ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's.

Configuration 1: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 2E + 2*4E =10E.

Configuration 2: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → energy 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Configuration 3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 2E + 2*9E=20E.

Configuration 4: n=2 (2), n=3 (2) → 2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E.

But wait, perhaps there's another configuration in between. What about n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1)? That would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. That's higher than 20E.

Another possibility: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), but that's the ground state. So after configuration 2 (15E), the next is configuration 3 (20E), then configuration 4 (26E).

But none of the options match 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the possible configurations.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Ah, 18E is 2*9E + ... Wait, 2*(9E) is 18E. So perhaps configuration 3 is 2 particles in n=1 and two in n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E. But 18E alone would require two particles in n=3. So perhaps configuration 3 is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), which gives 20E.

But wait, the second excited state in that case would be 20E, not 18E. So perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state has two particles in n=2 and two in n=3, giving 2*4E + 2*9E=8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than the 15E I thought earlier. So that can't be the first excited state.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible options. Looking back, the options are:

A) 30, 39,50

B)4,10,50

C)4,10,15

D)10,15,18.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ground state is 10E, which matches option D. Then the first excited state is 15E, which is option D's first excited. The second excited state in option D is 18E. So how could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require four particles. Let's see:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E.

n=3: 2 particles → 2*(9E)=18E.

Total: 2E+18E=20E.

But that's not matching 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So no.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2, but that would give 2*4E + 2*9E =8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 20E.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible states. Let me think again. Perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but what about the second excited state? Maybe another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. Then the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the energy would be 2E + 9E +16E=27E. But that's higher than the earlier 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). That's 2E +18E=20E.

So the options don't have 20E, but Option D's second excited is 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). But wait, we have four particles. n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1, n=4 has 1. Wait, but that's four particles. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E =31E. Which is higher than 20E.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible ground, first, and second excited states.

Ground State: 10E.

First Excited State:15E.

Second Excited State: perhaps 18E, which would be when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, because 2*(9E) +2*(1E) =18E +2E=20E. But I'm not getting that. Alternatively, perhaps it's when one is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would give 9E +16E=25E, which isn't 18E.

Wait a minute, perhaps the second excited state is 18E. How can that happen? Let me see: 18E is 2*(9E). So that would imply two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the total energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. That's 20E, not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that's 4E +9E=13E. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the energies are calculated. Let me re-express the possible configurations.

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first), 20E (second). But looking at the options, none have 20E as the second excited state. So perhaps the correct option is option D, which says ground is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E. But how?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a configuration where the second excited state is 18E. Let me think: 18E is 2*(9E), which would mean two particles in n=3, but perhaps in a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, but that would be 2*(9E) + 2*(16E)= 18E +32E=50E, which is option A's third state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and others in lower states, but that would require higher energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the possible configurations and the actual second excited state is 18E, which would imply that the configuration is two particles in n=3 and zero in n=2. But that would require n=3 to have two, which would give 18E plus the two in n=1, giving 20E. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a possible configuration where the total energy is 18E. Let me think: 18E could be 2*9E, which would require two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Which gives 2E + 18E=20E. So that's not 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me list all possible configurations with four particles, each in unique quantum states, and calculate their energies.

Configuration 1: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 10E.

Configuration 2: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Configuration 3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 2E + 18E=20E.

Configuration 4: n=2 (2), n=3 (2) → 8E + 18E=26E.

Configuration 5: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1) → 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Configuration 6: n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1) →2E+9E +16E=27E.

Configuration 7: n=2 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1) →8E +9E +16E=33E.

Configuration 8: n=1 (2), n=4 (2) →2E + 32E=34E.

Wait, but let me organize these energies in order:

10E → ground state.

15E → first excited.

20E → next.

22E.

26E.

27E.

33E.

34E.

So the second excited state would be 20E, which isn't an option. But the options don't have 20E as an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way the excited states are defined.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when another particle is promoted, but in a way that the total energy is lower than 20E. But I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Maybe I'm missing a configuration where the first excited state is lower than 15E.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the particles are arranged in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), giving 15E. The next state would be when two particles are in n=3, leading to 20E. So the second excited state is 20E.

But looking at the options, only option D has ground state 10E and first excited state 15E. Its second excited state is 18E, which doesn't match 20E. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way the particles are filled. Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't when one particle is promoted to n=3, but perhaps another configuration where the energy is lower. But I can't see any such configuration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are fermions, and in the first excited state, one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but the spin state changes somehow. But that wouldn't affect the energy because the energy depends only on n.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the ground state is 10E, the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 20E. But since none of the options have 20E as the second state, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking back at the options, option D says second excited is 18E, which would imply that the configuration is two particles in n=3, but the total energy would be 18E plus the rest.

Wait, if two particles are in n=3, that's 18E. But if the other two are in n=1, that's 2E. So total is 20E. So perhaps my initial assumption about the second excited state being 20E is correct, but the options don't have that. So maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake, and the second excited state is 18E, which would require that the configuration is one particle in n=3 and others in lower states, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the energies for each individual particle and then summing, but I think I'm doing that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option D: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But I'm not seeing how to get 18E as the second excited state.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two are in n=4. That would give 2*(9E) + 2*(16E) = 18E +32E=50E, which is option A's third state. But that can't be the second excited state, as it's higher than 20E.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct option is D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, but how? Because I can't see how the second excited state is 18E. Unless I'm missing a configuration where the energy is 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require the configuration to have n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1), which totals 2E +9E +16E=27E. That's higher than 20E.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should go with the option that matches the ground and first excited states I calculated, which is option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy levels for a single particle are given by:
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]
   Each quantum number \(n\) corresponds to a distinct energy level.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each \(n\) can hold up to two particles (due to spin up and spin down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**: The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest available energy levels. For four particles:
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=2\) (2 particles, energy \(E_2 = 4E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**: The next lowest energy configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\):
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=2\) (1 particle, energy \(E_2 = 4E\)),
   - \(n=3\) (1 particle, energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**: The next configuration is obtained by promoting another particle from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), resulting in:
   - \(n=1\) (2 particles, energy \(E_1 = E\)),
   - \(n=3\) (2 particles, energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).
   The total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected configuration-based progression.
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of \(4E\) is incorrect, as the minimum energy for four particles is \(10E\).
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy of \(4E\) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option B.
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: The ground state energy of \(10E\) and the first excited state energy of \(15E\) match the calculations. However, the second excited state energy of \(18E\) does not align with the calculated \(20E\). Despite this discrepancy, Option D is the closest match to the calculated values.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most consistent option with the calculated ground and first excited states is **Option D**.
