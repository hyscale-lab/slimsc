Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question talks about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I think that's more about how they discovered the planets, so maybe that's not directly relevant to the question itself.

The key points given are ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The options are A to D, with various factors.

Wait, so the question is about the orbital period. Hmm. I think I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the distance from the star and the mass of the star. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, but that's when the mass of the star is much larger than the planets, which is usually the case. So the formula is P^2 ∝ (a^3)/(M), but wait, maybe the exact formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³, but I might be mixing some terms.

But wait, in this problem, they don't mention the mass of the star. They only mention the masses of the planets. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Or maybe the TTV method tells us something about the system's parameters, like the mass ratios affecting the planet's orbits.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods, so perhaps we can relate it through the equilibrium temperatures and the mass ratios. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Let me read more. They have the equilibrium temperature ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, so T_eq2 / T_eq1 = 1.4. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3, so T_eq3 / T_eq2 ≈ 2.3. So overall, T_eq3 / T_eq1 = 1.4 * 2.3 = about 3.22.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * (L / (16πσ D²))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but wait, maybe a simpler version is T_eq ∝ sqrt(R_star/(D)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) * (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) ? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 + e) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 AU) / D )^(1/2) ), but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way is to think that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet radiates as a blackbody, so the temperature scales with the fourth root of the flux, which is proportional to (L/(4πD²)), so T_eq ∝ sqrt( (L/(4π D²) )^{1/2} ) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2D)), where R is the star's radius, D is the distance from the planet to the star. But perhaps for the same star, the T_star and R_star are the same for all planets, so the ratio of equilibrium temperatures would be sqrt(R/(2D)) for each planet. So the ratio of T_eq1 and T_eq2 would be sqrt(D2/D1), since R and 2 are constants.

Wait, because if T_eq is proportional to (L/(D²))^{1/4} (since L is the star's luminosity), and for the same star, L is the same, so T_eq ∝ D^{-1/2}.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (D2 / D1)^{1/2}.

Wait, because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if T_eq1 is for Planet1 at distance D1, T_eq2 is for Planet2 at D2. So T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (D1/D2)^{1/2}.

Wait, no, because if D increases, the temperature decreases. So if D2 = k * D1, then T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (1/sqrt(k)).

So the ratio T_eq2/T_eq1 = (D1/D2)^(1/2).

So given that T_eq2 / T_eq1 = 1.4, then (D1/D2)^(1/2) = 1.4. So D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Therefore, D2 = D1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.5102 D1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio T_eq3 / T_eq2 = 2.3, so (D2/D3)^(1/2) = 2.3 → D2/D3 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 / 5.29.

So let's compute D3 in terms of D1. Since D2 = D1 / 1.96, then D3 = (D1 / 1.96) / 5.29 = D1 / (1.96 *5.29) ≈ D1 / (10.4044) ≈ 0.0961 D1. So Planet3 is much farther than Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Using Kepler's third law, which in the case of a star much more massive than the planets, the period P is given by P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbits is the distance D). So P² ∝ a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, the problem doesn't give the mass of the star, but gives the masses of the planets. Hmm, but the star's mass is dominant, so perhaps the planet masses can be ignored. Alternatively, the question might not require the star's mass and we can assume it's the same for all planets.

Wait, but the main point is that the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. So P ∝ a^{3/2} / sqrt(M), but since M (the star's mass) is the same for all three planets, the periods scale as P ∝ a^{3/2}.

So if Planet3 is at D3, and Planet1 is at D1, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We already found that D3 = D1 / 10.4044. So D3/D1 = 1/10.4044 ≈ 0.0961.

So (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈ (0.0961)^(1.5) → Let's compute that.

0.0961 is approximately (0.31)^2. So square root is 0.31, and then cube is (0.31)^3 ≈ 0.0298. Wait, but wait, 0.0961 is about (1/10.4044) → 10.4044 is approximately 10.4, so D3 is about 0.0961 D1.

Alternatively, compute 0.0961^(3/2) → sqrt(0.0961) is ~0.31, then 0.31^3 ≈ 0.0298 or 0.03.

Wait, but 0.0961 is (0.31)^2, so sqrt is 0.31. Then 0.31^3 is 0.31 * 0.31 * 0.31 → 0.31 * 0.31 is 0.0961, *0.31 is 0.029791, about 0.0298. So P3/P1 ≈ 0.0298. But wait, that would suggest that Planet3's period is much shorter than Planet1's, but that can't be right because it's farther away. Wait, no, because according to Kepler's law, if a planet is farther away, its orbital period is longer. So if D3 is larger than D1, then P3 should be larger. Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I found that D3 is 0.0961 D1, which is smaller than D1. Because Planet3 is much closer. So if Planet3 is at D3 = D1 /10.4, then it's closer. So that would mean Planet3's orbital period is shorter than Planet1's.

But that can't be right because according to Kepler's law, closer planets orbit faster. So if Planet3 is closer, its period is shorter. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. If Planet3 is closer, its period is smaller, so the factor would be less than 1, which doesn't match any of the options given, because all options are greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance ratio. Let me go back.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4 (T1 and T2). So T_eq2 = 1.4 * T_eq1.

But T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (D1/D2)^(1/2) → 1.4 = (D1/D2)^(1/2) → D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = D1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.51 D1.

Similarly, T_eq3 = T_eq2 * 2.3 → T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T_eq1 = 3.22 T_eq1. But T_eq3 = T_eq1 * (D1/D3)^(1/2) → 3.22 = sqrt(D1/D3) → D1/D3 = (3.22)^2 → approximately 10.3684 → D3 = D1 / 10.3684 ≈ 0.0965 D1.

Wait, so D3 is about 0.0965 times D1. So D3 is much closer to the star than D1. So Planet3 is much closer, so it should have a shorter orbital period. So the period ratio P3/P1 is (D3/D1)^(3/2) → (0.0965)^(3/2) → which is a number less than 1.

But the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So if P3 is less than P1, the factor would be less than 1, which would correspond to a ratio of 0.029, for instance. But none of the options are less than 1. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I got the equilibrium temperature inversely. Because if Planet3 is farther away, D3 would be larger, not smaller. Hmm, that would make more sense because the question is giving options for a larger period.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the distance ratios. Let me recheck.

Equilibrium temperature T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D. So T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So if T_eq2 is 1.4 times T_eq1, then T_eq2 = 1.4 * T_eq1.

Which means that D2 is smaller than D1, because temperature is higher when closer. So D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 → (1/1.4)^2 = (5/7)^2 → 25/49 ≈ 0.5102, so D2 ≈ 0.5102 D1.

Similarly, T_eq3 is 2.3 times T_eq2 → T_eq3 = 2.3 * T_eq2 = 2.3 * 1.4 * T_eq1 = 3.22 T_eq1.

So T_eq3 = 3.22 T_eq1 → D3 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 → (1/3.22)^2 ≈ (0.3105)^2 ≈ 0.0964. So D3 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So D3 is about 9.6% of D1. So Planet3 is much closer to the star than Planet1. So its orbital period should be shorter, not longer. But the question is asking by what factor is Planet3's period LARGER than Planet1's. So I must have made a mistake because the options are all larger than 1.

Wait, maybe the question is about the equilibrium temperature in the other direction. Let me read the question again.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So it's Planet1/Planet2?

Wait, no, the question says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." It doesn't specify which way. Oh, that's ambiguous. So perhaps the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, or T2/T1=1.4.

Wait, in the question, it says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, I think that's a bit ambiguous. But earlier I assumed T_eq2/T_eq1 = 1.4, which led to T_eq2 being higher, meaning Planet2 is closer.

But perhaps it's the other way around. Let me try the other possibility: T_eq1/T_eq2 =1.4 → T_eq2 = T_eq1 /1.4 ≈ 0.714 T_eq1 → So D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 → (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = 1.96 D1. So Planet2 is farther away than Planet1. Hmm, that would change things.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

"Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3."

So, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4. I think in my earlier calculation, I assumed T2/T1=1.4, leading to Planet2 being closer. But perhaps the correct way is that T1 is 1.4 times T2, which would mean Planet1 is closer.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. If the planet is closer, its equilibrium temperature is higher. So if Planet1 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet2, that would mean D1 < D2. So Planet1 is closer.

Wait, no, no! If a planet is closer, it's hotter. So higher T_eq means the planet is closer.

So if T_eq1 is higher than T_eq2, D1 < D2.

So in this problem, if the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, it's unclear which way. Let's think about the exact wording: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4."

The ratio could be T1/T2 =1.4. Or T2/T1=1.4. The way the problem is phrased, it's ambiguous. But perhaps the problem lists the ratios as Planet1 to Planet2 and Planet2 to Planet3, so perhaps it's T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 =2.3.

Wait, no, the problem says: the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Without more context, perhaps it's better to assume it's T_eq1 / T_eq2 =1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. But in reality, if Planet1 is hotter, it's closer.

Let me proceed with that assumption.

So:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 =1.4 → T_eq2 = T_eq1 /1.4.

Since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), then D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2 )^2.

So D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 = 1.96 D1.

So Planet2 is farther than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So if we take T_eq2 / T_eq3 =2.3, then T_eq3 = T_eq2 /2.3.

So D3 = D2 * (T_eq2 / T_eq3 )^2 → (2.3)^2 =5.29 → D3= D2 *5.29 = 1.96 D1 *5.29 → D3=1.96*5.29 D1 → 1.96 *5=9.8, 1.96 *0.29=0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 D1.

So Planet3 is at D3=10.3684 D1, which is much farther than Planet1.

Now, the orbital period scales as P² ∝ a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. Since all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same, so P² ∝ a^3.

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.3684 raised to the 3/2 power.

First, find sqrt(10.3684) → approx 3.22.

Then, 3.22 cubed → 3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684, then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.37.

So P3/P1 ≈33.37, which is approximately 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way: 10.3684^3 is (10.3684)^3 = approx 10^3=1000, but more accurately, 10.3684^3 is about (10^3) + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + other terms. But perhaps it's easier to compute 10.3684^(3/2) as (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

We know that sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22, as 3.22^2 = 10.3684. So 3.22^3 = 3.22 *3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684 *3.22.

Compute 10.3684 *3.22:

10 *3.22 =32.2

0.3684 *3.22 ≈ 1.186.

So total ≈32.2 +1.186 =33.386 → approximately 33.4, which matches option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star, i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \). Using the given equilibrium temperature ratios, we calculate the distance ratios and then use Kepler's law to relate the orbital periods to the distances.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratios and Distance Ratios
1. **Between Planet1 and Planet2**:  
   The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is \( \frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = 1.4 \).  
   Since \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), the distance ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{D_2}{D_1} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}}\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]  
   Thus, \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \).

2. **Between Planet2 and Planet3**:  
   The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is \( \frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}} = 2.3 \).  
   Similarly, the distance ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{D_3}{D_2} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}}\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]  
   Thus, \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \).

3. **Overall Distance of Planet3 Relative to Planet1**:  
   Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \):  
   \[
   D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1
   \]  
   Therefore, \( D_3 \approx 10.3684 D_1 \).

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):  
\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]  
Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]  
Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} = 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]  
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):  
\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
\]  
Then, cube this result:  
\[
(3.22)^3 = 3.22 \times 3.22 \times 3.22 \approx 33.4
\]  
Thus, \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.4 \).

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question talks about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I think that's more about how they discovered the planets, so maybe that's not directly relevant to the question itself.

The key points given are ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The options are A to D, with various factors.

Wait, so the question is about the orbital period. Hmm. I think I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the distance from the star and the mass of the star. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, but that's when the mass of the star is much larger than the planets, which is usually the case. So the formula is P^2 ∝ (a^3)/(M), but wait, maybe the exact formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³, but I might be mixing some terms.

But wait, in this problem, they don't mention the mass of the star. They only mention the masses of the planets. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Or maybe the TTV method tells us something about the system's parameters, like the mass ratios affecting the planet's orbits.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods, so perhaps we can relate it through the equilibrium temperatures and the mass ratios. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Let me read more. They have the equilibrium temperature ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, so T_eq2 / T_eq1 = 1.4. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3, so T_eq3 / T_eq2 ≈ 2.3. So overall, T_eq3 / T_eq1 = 1.4 * 2.3 = about 3.22.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * (L / (16πσ D²))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but wait, maybe a simpler version is T_eq ∝ sqrt(R_star/(D)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) * (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) ? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 + e) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 AU) / D )^(1/2) ), but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way is to think that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet radiates as a blackbody, so the temperature scales with the fourth root of the flux, which is proportional to (L/(4πD²)), so T_eq ∝ sqrt( (L/(4π D²) )^{1/2} ) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2D)), where R is the star's radius, D is the distance from the planet to the star. But perhaps for the same star, the T_star and R_star are the same for all planets, so the ratio of equilibrium temperatures would be sqrt(R/(2D)) for each planet. So the ratio of T_eq1 and T_eq2 would be sqrt(D2/D1), since R and 2 are constants.

Wait, because if T_eq is proportional to (L/(D²))^{1/4} (since L is the star's luminosity), and for the same star, L is the same, so T_eq ∝ D^{-1/2}.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (D2 / D1)^{1/2}.

Wait, because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if T_eq1 is for Planet1 at distance D1, T_eq2 is for Planet2 at D2. So T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (D1/D2)^{1/2}.

Wait, no, because if D increases, the temperature decreases. So if D2 = k * D1, then T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (1/sqrt(k)).

So the ratio T_eq2/T_eq1 = (D1/D2)^(1/2).

So given that T_eq2 / T_eq1 = 1.4, then (D1/D2)^(1/2) = 1.4. So D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Therefore, D2 = D1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.5102 D1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio T_eq3 / T_eq2 = 2.3, so (D2/D3)^(1/2) = 2.3 → D2/D3 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 / 5.29.

So let's compute D3 in terms of D1. Since D2 = D1 / 1.96, then D3 = (D1 / 1.96) / 5.29 = D1 / (1.96 *5.29) ≈ D1 / (10.4044) ≈ 0.0961 D1. So Planet3 is much farther than Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Using Kepler's third law, which in the case of a star much more massive than the planets, the period P is given by P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbits is the distance D). So P² ∝ a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, the problem doesn't give the mass of the star, but gives the masses of the planets. Hmm, but the star's mass is dominant, so perhaps the planet masses can be ignored. Alternatively, the question might not require the star's mass and we can assume it's the same for all planets.

Wait, but the main point is that the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. So P ∝ a^{3/2} / sqrt(M), but since M (the star's mass) is the same for all three planets, the periods scale as P ∝ a^{3/2}.

So if Planet3 is at D3, and Planet1 is at D1, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We already found that D3 = D1 / 10.4044. So D3/D1 = 1/10.4044 ≈ 0.0961.

So (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈ (0.0961)^(1.5) → Let's compute that.

0.0961 is approximately (0.31)^2. So square root is 0.31, and then cube is (0.31)^3 ≈ 0.0298. Wait, but wait, 0.0961 is about (1/10.4044) → 10.4044 is approximately 10.4, so D3 is about 0.0961 D1.

Alternatively, compute 0.0961^(3/2) → sqrt(0.0961) is ~0.31, then 0.31^3 ≈ 0.0298 or 0.03.

Wait, but 0.0961 is (0.31)^2, so sqrt is 0.31. Then 0.31^3 is 0.31 * 0.31 * 0.31 → 0.31 * 0.31 is 0.0961, *0.31 is 0.029791, about 0.0298. So P3/P1 ≈ 0.0298. But wait, that would suggest that Planet3's period is much shorter than Planet1's, but that can't be right because it's farther away. Wait, no, because according to Kepler's law, if a planet is farther away, its orbital period is longer. So if D3 is larger than D1, then P3 should be larger. Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I found that D3 is 0.0961 D1, which is smaller than D1. Because Planet3 is much closer. So if Planet3 is at D3 = D1 /10.4, then it's closer. So that would mean Planet3's orbital period is shorter than Planet1's.

But that can't be right because according to Kepler's law, closer planets orbit faster. So if Planet3 is closer, its period is shorter. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. If Planet3 is closer, its period is smaller, so the factor would be less than 1, which doesn't match any of the options given, because all options are greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance ratio. Let me go back.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4 (T1 and T2). So T_eq2 = 1.4 * T_eq1.

But T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So T_eq2 = T_eq1 * (D1/D2)^(1/2) → 1.4 = (D1/D2)^(1/2) → D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = D1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.51 D1.

Similarly, T_eq3 = T_eq2 * 2.3 → T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T_eq1 = 3.22 T_eq1. But T_eq3 = T_eq1 * (D1/D3)^(1/2) → 3.22 = sqrt(D1/D3) → D1/D3 = (3.22)^2 → approximately 10.3684 → D3 = D1 / 10.3684 ≈ 0.0965 D1.

Wait, so D3 is about 0.0965 times D1. So D3 is much closer to the star than D1. So Planet3 is much closer, so it should have a shorter orbital period. So the period ratio P3/P1 is (D3/D1)^(3/2) → (0.0965)^(3/2) → which is a number less than 1.

But the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So if P3 is less than P1, the factor would be less than 1, which would correspond to a ratio of 0.029, for instance. But none of the options are less than 1. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I got the equilibrium temperature inversely. Because if Planet3 is farther away, D3 would be larger, not smaller. Hmm, that would make more sense because the question is giving options for a larger period.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the distance ratios. Let me recheck.

Equilibrium temperature T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D. So T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So if T_eq2 is 1.4 times T_eq1, then T_eq2 = 1.4 * T_eq1.

Which means that D2 is smaller than D1, because temperature is higher when closer. So D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 → (1/1.4)^2 = (5/7)^2 → 25/49 ≈ 0.5102, so D2 ≈ 0.5102 D1.

Similarly, T_eq3 is 2.3 times T_eq2 → T_eq3 = 2.3 * T_eq2 = 2.3 * 1.4 * T_eq1 = 3.22 T_eq1.

So T_eq3 = 3.22 T_eq1 → D3 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 → (1/3.22)^2 ≈ (0.3105)^2 ≈ 0.0964. So D3 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So D3 is about 9.6% of D1. So Planet3 is much closer to the star than Planet1. So its orbital period should be shorter, not longer. But the question is asking by what factor is Planet3's period LARGER than Planet1's. So I must have made a mistake because the options are all larger than 1.

Wait, maybe the question is about the equilibrium temperature in the other direction. Let me read the question again.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So it's Planet1/Planet2?

Wait, no, the question says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." It doesn't specify which way. Oh, that's ambiguous. So perhaps the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, or T2/T1=1.4.

Wait, in the question, it says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, I think that's a bit ambiguous. But earlier I assumed T_eq2/T_eq1 = 1.4, which led to T_eq2 being higher, meaning Planet2 is closer.

But perhaps it's the other way around. Let me try the other possibility: T_eq1/T_eq2 =1.4 → T_eq2 = T_eq1 /1.4 ≈ 0.714 T_eq1 → So D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 → (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = 1.96 D1. So Planet2 is farther away than Planet1. Hmm, that would change things.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

"Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3."

So, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4. I think in my earlier calculation, I assumed T2/T1=1.4, leading to Planet2 being closer. But perhaps the correct way is that T1 is 1.4 times T2, which would mean Planet1 is closer.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. If the planet is closer, its equilibrium temperature is higher. So if Planet1 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet2, that would mean D1 < D2. So Planet1 is closer.

Wait, no, no! If a planet is closer, it's hotter. So higher T_eq means the planet is closer.

So if T_eq1 is higher than T_eq2, D1 < D2.

So in this problem, if the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, it's unclear which way. Let's think about the exact wording: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4."

The ratio could be T1/T2 =1.4. Or T2/T1=1.4. The way the problem is phrased, it's ambiguous. But perhaps the problem lists the ratios as Planet1 to Planet2 and Planet2 to Planet3, so perhaps it's T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 =2.3.

Wait, no, the problem says: the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Without more context, perhaps it's better to assume it's T_eq1 / T_eq2 =1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. But in reality, if Planet1 is hotter, it's closer.

Let me proceed with that assumption.

So:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 =1.4 → T_eq2 = T_eq1 /1.4.

Since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), then D2 = D1 * (T_eq1 / T_eq2 )^2.

So D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 = 1.96 D1.

So Planet2 is farther than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So if we take T_eq2 / T_eq3 =2.3, then T_eq3 = T_eq2 /2.3.

So D3 = D2 * (T_eq2 / T_eq3 )^2 → (2.3)^2 =5.29 → D3= D2 *5.29 = 1.96 D1 *5.29 → D3=1.96*5.29 D1 → 1.96 *5=9.8, 1.96 *0.29=0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 D1.

So Planet3 is at D3=10.3684 D1, which is much farther than Planet1.

Now, the orbital period scales as P² ∝ a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. Since all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same, so P² ∝ a^3.

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.3684 raised to the 3/2 power.

First, find sqrt(10.3684) → approx 3.22.

Then, 3.22 cubed → 3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684, then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.37.

So P3/P1 ≈33.37, which is approximately 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way: 10.3684^3 is (10.3684)^3 = approx 10^3=1000, but more accurately, 10.3684^3 is about (10^3) + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + other terms. But perhaps it's easier to compute 10.3684^(3/2) as (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

We know that sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22, as 3.22^2 = 10.3684. So 3.22^3 = 3.22 *3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684 *3.22.

Compute 10.3684 *3.22:

10 *3.22 =32.2

0.3684 *3.22 ≈ 1.186.

So total ≈32.2 +1.186 =33.386 → approximately 33.4, which matches option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star, i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \). Using the given equilibrium temperature ratios, we calculate the distance ratios and then use Kepler's law to relate the orbital periods to the distances.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratios and Distance Ratios
1. **Between Planet1 and Planet2**:  
   The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is \( \frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = 1.4 \).  
   Since \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), the distance ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{D_2}{D_1} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}}\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]  
   Thus, \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \).

2. **Between Planet2 and Planet3**:  
   The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is \( \frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}} = 2.3 \).  
   Similarly, the distance ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{D_3}{D_2} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}}\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]  
   Thus, \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \).

3. **Overall Distance of Planet3 Relative to Planet1**:  
   Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \):  
   \[
   D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1
   \]  
   Therefore, \( D_3 \approx 10.3684 D_1 \).

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):  
\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]  
Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]  
Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} = 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]  
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):  
\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
\]  
Then, cube this result:  
\[
(3.22)^3 = 3.22 \times 3.22 \times 3.22 \approx 33.4
\]  
Thus, \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.4 \).

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
