Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says each spin S1, S2, and S3 can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, all exponential functions multiplied by coefficients.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), so higher temperature would mean lower beta. But wait, in the options I see terms with beta multiplied by J, like e^(Jβ) and e^(-Jβ), so perhaps the energies are in terms of J.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So the partition function should be a sum of 8 terms, each term being exp(-beta E_i), where E_i is the energy for each state.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 possibilities. Let me think about the symmetry or possible groupings of states.

The Hamiltonian is H = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Alternatively, the energy can be rewritten as H = -J [ (S1 S2) + (S1 S3) + (S2 S3) ].

Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different. So each S_i S_j can be ±1.

Let me think about what the possible values of H can be. Since H is the sum of three terms each being S_i S_j, multiplied by -J.

Wait, S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary.

Let’s try to find all possible values of the sum. Let me consider all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But that's 8 possibilities. Maybe it's easier to categorize the states based on how many pairs are aligned.

Each pair can be aligned (same spins) or anti-aligned (different). But wait, the system is three spins, so if all three are the same, all pairs are aligned. If two are same and one different, then some pairs are aligned and some are not.

Let me think: for three spins, each being ±1, the possible cases are:

1. All three spins are the same: S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1. So two such states.

In this case, each pair S_i S_j is +1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3. So H = -J*(3) = -3J.

So the energy for these two states is E = -3J.

2. Two spins are the same, one different. How many such states are there? Let's see: for each choice of which spin is different, there are two possibilities. So for three spins, there are 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to pick which spin is different, and for each, the different spin can be either +1 or -1, but wait, no—actually, when you flip one spin, the state changes. So maybe for each initial configuration (all same), flipping any one spin gives a different state. So for each of the two all-same states, flipping any one spin gives a different state. So that's 2 * 3 = 6 states where exactly two spins are the same.

Wait, no, let me think again. For the all-up state (+1, +1, +1), flipping S1 gives (-1, +1, +1). Similarly, flipping S2 gives (+1, -1, +1), and S3 gives (+1, +1, -1). That's three states. Similarly, for the all-down state, flipping any spin gives another state where two are down and one is up. So total of 6 states where exactly two spins are aligned, and one is opposite.

Wait, no, wait. No, if two are same and one different, how many such states are there? Let's think:

Each of the three spins can be the one that's different. For each, the different spin can be either +1 or -1, but wait, no—because if the majority are +1, then the different one is -1, and vice versa.

Wait no, perhaps it's easier to count. The number of states with exactly two spins the same and one different is 3 * 2 =6. Because for each of the three possible spins that can be different, the different spin can take either +1 or -1, but only in a way that it's different from the majority. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the number of such states is calculated as:

Total number of states that are not all same: 8 - 2 =6. So all except the two all-same states. So 6 states are where not all are same.

Of these 6, some have two +1 and one -1, others have two -1 and one +1.

Wait, for each spin configuration, the sum S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 depends on how many pairs are aligned.

In the case where two are same and one different, let's say, for example, S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then:

S1 S2 = (+1)(+1)= +1.

S1 S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.

S2 S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.

So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So H = -J * (-1) = J.

Similarly, any state where exactly two spins are same and one is different will have the sum of the three products equal to (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So each of these 6 states has energy E = J.

Wait, no, let's see another case. Suppose two spins are -1, and one is +1. For example, S1 = S2 = -1, S3=+1.

Then S1 S2= 1, S1 S3= -1, S2 S3= -1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1, same as before.

So all 6 such states have E = J.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. How about that? Then:

S1 S2= -1; S1 S3= +1; S2 S3 = -1.

Sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. So yes, same result.

So in all cases where exactly two spins are same and one is different, the sum is -1, so E= J.

Then the third case: all spins are different. Wait, but for three spins, each being ±1, can all three be different? No, because with three spins, each being +1 or -1, you can't have all three different. Because you can have two of one and one of the other, but not all three different. So the only possibilities are all same or two same and one different.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, three spins can't all be different because each spin is either +1 or -1. So the third case isn't possible. So only two types of states: two where all are same, and six where exactly two are same and one different.

Wait, wait, wait—no, wait, no. Because for three spins, it's impossible to have all three different because each spin can only be +1 or -1. So you can't have all three being different; the maximum number of different spins is two. So all states are either all same or two same and one different.

So the possible energies are E = -3J (for all same) and E = J (for two same, one different).

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).

Each of the two all-same states contributes exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3J beta).

Each of the six two-same states contributes exp(-beta*(J)) = exp(-J beta).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 J beta) + 6 exp(-J beta).

Wait, looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}, which is the opposite of what I have. Option B is Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}, which matches what I got.

Wait, wait. Let me check the energy calculation again. Because the energy is E = -J [sum of S_i S_j].

Wait, when all spins are same, each S_i S_j is +1. So sum is 3, so E = -J *3 = -3J. So exp(-beta E) is exp(3J beta).

When two spins are same and one different, the sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. So exp(-beta E) is exp(-J beta).

So the two all-same states contribute 2 * e^{3 J beta}.

The six two-same states contribute 6 * e^{- J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}.

Looking at the options, that's option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but let me double-check if I got the energy right. Because sometimes when I'm doing the math, I might mix up the signs.

Wait, the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So when the sum is 3, E is -3J. When the sum is -1, E is J.

So for all same spins, E is -3J, so the exponential is e^{beta * 3J}.

Wait, no, because beta is 1/(kT), so the exponential is exp(-beta E). So for E=-3J, it's exp(3J beta). Correct.

So the partition function is 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}, which is option B. So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each taking values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the goal is to compute the partition function \( Z \), defined as the sum over all possible states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Possible States and Energies**:
   - Each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states.
   - The energy depends on the pairwise products \( S_iS_j \), which can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)).

2. **Energy Cases**:
   - **Case 1: All spins are the same** (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \)):
     - There are 2 such states: all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \).
     - For all spins the same, \( S_iS_j = +1 \) for all pairs, so the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \).
     - Energy: \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
   - **Case 2: Two spins are the same, one is different**:
     - There are 6 such states (3 choices for which spin is different, and 2 possibilities for its value).
     - For two spins the same and one different, the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \).
     - Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

3. **Partition Function**:
   - The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of \( \exp(-\beta E) \) over all states.
   - For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \): \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).
   - For the 6 states with \( E = J \): \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).
   - Thus, \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option A: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).
   - Option B: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
   - Option C: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, incorrect exponents).
   - Option D: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says each spin S1, S2, and S3 can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, all exponential functions multiplied by coefficients.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), so higher temperature would mean lower beta. But wait, in the options I see terms with beta multiplied by J, like e^(Jβ) and e^(-Jβ), so perhaps the energies are in terms of J.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So the partition function should be a sum of 8 terms, each term being exp(-beta E_i), where E_i is the energy for each state.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 possibilities. Let me think about the symmetry or possible groupings of states.

The Hamiltonian is H = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Alternatively, the energy can be rewritten as H = -J [ (S1 S2) + (S1 S3) + (S2 S3) ].

Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different. So each S_i S_j can be ±1.

Let me think about what the possible values of H can be. Since H is the sum of three terms each being S_i S_j, multiplied by -J.

Wait, S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary.

Let’s try to find all possible values of the sum. Let me consider all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But that's 8 possibilities. Maybe it's easier to categorize the states based on how many pairs are aligned.

Each pair can be aligned (same spins) or anti-aligned (different). But wait, the system is three spins, so if all three are the same, all pairs are aligned. If two are same and one different, then some pairs are aligned and some are not.

Let me think: for three spins, each being ±1, the possible cases are:

1. All three spins are the same: S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1. So two such states.

In this case, each pair S_i S_j is +1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3. So H = -J*(3) = -3J.

So the energy for these two states is E = -3J.

2. Two spins are the same, one different. How many such states are there? Let's see: for each choice of which spin is different, there are two possibilities. So for three spins, there are 3 choose 1 = 3 ways to pick which spin is different, and for each, the different spin can be either +1 or -1, but wait, no—actually, when you flip one spin, the state changes. So maybe for each initial configuration (all same), flipping any one spin gives a different state. So for each of the two all-same states, flipping any one spin gives a different state. So that's 2 * 3 = 6 states where exactly two spins are the same.

Wait, no, let me think again. For the all-up state (+1, +1, +1), flipping S1 gives (-1, +1, +1). Similarly, flipping S2 gives (+1, -1, +1), and S3 gives (+1, +1, -1). That's three states. Similarly, for the all-down state, flipping any spin gives another state where two are down and one is up. So total of 6 states where exactly two spins are aligned, and one is opposite.

Wait, no, wait. No, if two are same and one different, how many such states are there? Let's think:

Each of the three spins can be the one that's different. For each, the different spin can be either +1 or -1, but wait, no—because if the majority are +1, then the different one is -1, and vice versa.

Wait no, perhaps it's easier to count. The number of states with exactly two spins the same and one different is 3 * 2 =6. Because for each of the three possible spins that can be different, the different spin can take either +1 or -1, but only in a way that it's different from the majority. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the number of such states is calculated as:

Total number of states that are not all same: 8 - 2 =6. So all except the two all-same states. So 6 states are where not all are same.

Of these 6, some have two +1 and one -1, others have two -1 and one +1.

Wait, for each spin configuration, the sum S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 depends on how many pairs are aligned.

In the case where two are same and one different, let's say, for example, S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then:

S1 S2 = (+1)(+1)= +1.

S1 S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.

S2 S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.

So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So H = -J * (-1) = J.

Similarly, any state where exactly two spins are same and one is different will have the sum of the three products equal to (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So each of these 6 states has energy E = J.

Wait, no, let's see another case. Suppose two spins are -1, and one is +1. For example, S1 = S2 = -1, S3=+1.

Then S1 S2= 1, S1 S3= -1, S2 S3= -1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1, same as before.

So all 6 such states have E = J.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. How about that? Then:

S1 S2= -1; S1 S3= +1; S2 S3 = -1.

Sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. So yes, same result.

So in all cases where exactly two spins are same and one is different, the sum is -1, so E= J.

Then the third case: all spins are different. Wait, but for three spins, each being ±1, can all three be different? No, because with three spins, each being +1 or -1, you can't have all three different. Because you can have two of one and one of the other, but not all three different. So the only possibilities are all same or two same and one different.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, three spins can't all be different because each spin is either +1 or -1. So the third case isn't possible. So only two types of states: two where all are same, and six where exactly two are same and one different.

Wait, wait, wait—no, wait, no. Because for three spins, it's impossible to have all three different because each spin can only be +1 or -1. So you can't have all three being different; the maximum number of different spins is two. So all states are either all same or two same and one different.

So the possible energies are E = -3J (for all same) and E = J (for two same, one different).

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).

Each of the two all-same states contributes exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3J beta).

Each of the six two-same states contributes exp(-beta*(J)) = exp(-J beta).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 J beta) + 6 exp(-J beta).

Wait, looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}, which is the opposite of what I have. Option B is Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}, which matches what I got.

Wait, wait. Let me check the energy calculation again. Because the energy is E = -J [sum of S_i S_j].

Wait, when all spins are same, each S_i S_j is +1. So sum is 3, so E = -J *3 = -3J. So exp(-beta E) is exp(3J beta).

When two spins are same and one different, the sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. So exp(-beta E) is exp(-J beta).

So the two all-same states contribute 2 * e^{3 J beta}.

The six two-same states contribute 6 * e^{- J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}.

Looking at the options, that's option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but let me double-check if I got the energy right. Because sometimes when I'm doing the math, I might mix up the signs.

Wait, the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So when the sum is 3, E is -3J. When the sum is -1, E is J.

So for all same spins, E is -3J, so the exponential is e^{beta * 3J}.

Wait, no, because beta is 1/(kT), so the exponential is exp(-beta E). So for E=-3J, it's exp(3J beta). Correct.

So the partition function is 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}, which is option B. So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each taking values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \).

   - For the 6 states with \( E = J \): \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

   - Option D: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
