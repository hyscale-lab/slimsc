Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is represented by |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron is in a p orbital because l=1 for each. Then, the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction should be -ħ.

Wait, I remember that for orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues are Lz = mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Since each electron is in a p orbital (l=1), possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So, for each electron, L1z could be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product of the individual states. Because when we're dealing with angular momentum coupling, the total state is a combination of all possible ways the individual states can combine to give the total l and m.

Wait, the coupled state is given as a specific combination, but without knowing the exact combination coefficients, how can I proceed? Oh, wait, maybe the state is already expressed as a product of individual states. Or perhaps, I need to find out the possible ways to get each electron's m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1, and the total l would be 2.

Wait, no, the total quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. The coupling of two angular momenta l1 and l2 gives possible total l values from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, l1=1 and l2=1, so possible l are 0,1,2. So the coupled state is for l=2, m=-1. 

But the question is about the individual m1 and m2 values. Since the total m is m1 + m2 = M = -1. So, for each electron, their individual m values add up to -1.

But the problem says that each electron is in a p orbital, so l1=l2=1. So, each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1. But their sum needs to be -1.

Wait, the measurement is for L1z and L2z both being -ħ. So, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z = m1 ħ, L2z = m2 ħ. So in that case, m1 + m2 = -2, which would imply M = -2. But our coupled state has M = -1. That can't happen, right? Because in the given state, the total m is -1, so the sum of the individual m's must be -1.

Wait, so for the sum m1 + m2 to be -1, possible pairs are:

m1= -1, m2= 0 → sum -1.

m1= 0, m2= -1 → sum -1.

m1= -1, m2= 0: same as above.

But if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total M of -1. So that's not possible.

So, the only possibilities for the individual m's that sum to -1 are when one is -1 and the other is 0. So, let's think about that.

But the problem is, the measurement is of both being -ħ. Which would be m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But their sum would be -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So, in the given coupled state, can this happen?

Wait, so the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to M=-1 and total l=2. But if you have m1=-1 and m2=-1, that would sum to M=-2, which is not the case here. So, this specific combination (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not part of the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total angular momentum quantum number and M is the total z-component. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the two electrons' angular momenta add up to L=2 and M=-1.

But when we express this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, it's a linear combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M=-1. So the possible terms would be m1= -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2= -1.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states. Therefore, when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you can only get the combinations where m1 and m2 sum to -1.

So, in this state, the possible outcomes are either (m1=-1, m2=0) or (m1=0, m2=-1). Therefore, the probability of getting both m1 and m2 as -1 (which would give M=-2) is zero because that outcome isn't possible in this state.

So, in this case, the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -ħ is zero. Because that would require M=-2, which is not what the state is in. Hence, the probability is zero.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state represented as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l=2$ and $m=-1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding $z$-component of the system, respectively. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

For orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are given by $m\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. Since each electron is in a $p$ orbital ($l=1$), the possible $m$ values for each electron are $-1, 0, +1$. The total $z$-component of angular momentum is $m_1 + m_2 = M$, where $M=-1$ in this case.

To measure both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, the corresponding $m_1$ and $m_2$ values must both be $-1$. This would result in $M = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. However, the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has $M=-1$, which means $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. Therefore, the combination $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is not part of the state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible combinations are:
- $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
- $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

Since the combination $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$ is not included in the state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is represented by |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron is in a p orbital because l=1 for each. Then, the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction should be -ħ.

Wait, I remember that for orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues are Lz = mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Since each electron is in a p orbital (l=1), possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So, for each electron, L1z could be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product of the individual states. Because when we're dealing with angular momentum coupling, the total state is a combination of all possible ways the individual states can combine to give the total l and m.

Wait, the coupled state is given as a specific combination, but without knowing the exact combination coefficients, how can I proceed? Oh, wait, maybe the state is already expressed as a product of individual states. Or perhaps, I need to find out the possible ways to get each electron's m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1, and the total l would be 2.

Wait, no, the total quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. The coupling of two angular momenta l1 and l2 gives possible total l values from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, l1=1 and l2=1, so possible l are 0,1,2. So the coupled state is for l=2, m=-1. 

But the question is about the individual m1 and m2 values. Since the total m is m1 + m2 = M = -1. So, for each electron, their individual m values add up to -1.

But the problem says that each electron is in a p orbital, so l1=l2=1. So, each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1. But their sum needs to be -1.

Wait, the measurement is for L1z and L2z both being -ħ. So, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z = m1 ħ, L2z = m2 ħ. So in that case, m1 + m2 = -2, which would imply M = -2. But our coupled state has M = -1. That can't happen, right? Because in the given state, the total m is -1, so the sum of the individual m's must be -1.

Wait, so for the sum m1 + m2 to be -1, possible pairs are:

m1= -1, m2= 0 → sum -1.

m1= 0, m2= -1 → sum -1.

m1= -1, m2= 0: same as above.

But if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total M of -1. So that's not possible.

So, the only possibilities for the individual m's that sum to -1 are when one is -1 and the other is 0. So, let's think about that.

But the problem is, the measurement is of both being -ħ. Which would be m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But their sum would be -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So, in the given coupled state, can this happen?

Wait, so the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to M=-1 and total l=2. But if you have m1=-1 and m2=-1, that would sum to M=-2, which is not the case here. So, this specific combination (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not part of the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total angular momentum quantum number and M is the total z-component. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the two electrons' angular momenta add up to L=2 and M=-1.

But when we express this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, it's a linear combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M=-1. So the possible terms would be m1= -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2= -1.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states. Therefore, when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you can only get the combinations where m1 and m2 sum to -1.

So, in this state, the possible outcomes are either (m1=-1, m2=0) or (m1=0, m2=-1). Therefore, the probability of getting both m1 and m2 as -1 (which would give M=-2) is zero because that outcome isn't possible in this state.

So, in this case, the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -ħ is zero. Because that would require M=-2, which is not what the state is in. Hence, the probability is zero.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state represented as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l=2$ and $m=-1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding $z$-component of the system, respectively. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

For orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are given by $m\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. Since each electron is in a $p$ orbital ($l=1$), the possible $m$ values for each electron are $-1, 0, +1$. The total $z$-component of angular momentum is $m_1 + m_2 = M$, where $M=-1$ in this case.

To measure both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, the corresponding $m_1$ and $m_2$ values must both be $-1$. This would result in $M = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. However, the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has $M=-1$, which means $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. Therefore, the combination $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is not part of the state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible combinations are:
- $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
- $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

Since the combination $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$ is not included in the state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.
