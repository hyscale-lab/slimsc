Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? Because cyclohex-3-ene means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, on carbon 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO) and on carbon 5, a vinyl group (which is CH2=CH-). Oh, and it's a carboxylic acid, so there's a COOH group somewhere. Wait, in the name, the substituents are numbered. So the main chain is the cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 3, 5, and maybe another position.

Wait, the structure. Let me try drawing it mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-ene position. Then, position 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl (CH2CH2? No, wait vinyl is CH2=CH–). So, the substituents are at 2 and 5, with the double bonds in the ring and in the vinyl group.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh right! That's the reaction for the hydrolysis of a carbonyl group, but wait, no. Wait, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it's a type of reduction. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's different. Wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—I think that's used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh no, wait: that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right? Or wait, maybe it's the situation where the carbonyl is being transformed into something else.

Wait, no, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI can also be involved in the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, there's a reaction where ketones or aldehydes are treated with H2O and H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, but that's oxidation. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, wait: I think that when you have an aldehyde or ketone reacting with H2O (and perhaps an acid catalyst), it's just a hydration, but that doesn't seem right here. Wait, but wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, perhaps it's the deoxygenation reaction, where the carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is converted into a methylene group. Wait, that might be the case here.

So, the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO) at position 2. So, if that CHO is transformed, perhaps the reaction is converting the aldehyde group into a CH2 group. Because, thinking about the reaction: I remember that in the presence of a strong reducing agent, an aldehyde can be reduced to a primary alcohol, but with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, wait—another reaction: the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for introducing formyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the deoxygenation of the aldehyde. I think the reaction of aldehydes or ketones with HI and red phosphorus is known for deoxygenation, where the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the aldehyde (CHO) would become CH2. Let me think: the reaction is RCHO + HI (excess) → RCH2I + H2O? Or maybe it's a different product. Alternatively, could it be that the aldehyde group is being converted into an iodinated compound? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds in the molecule. So, if the product has fewer rings or double bonds, the index would change.

So, the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's count the hydrogen deficiencies.

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so that's 1). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has another double bond (so that's 2). The formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl, which is a double bond (so that's 3). The carboxylic acid is COOH, which is a carbonyl (but that's part of the same group as the ring, so the ring has a double bond and the COOH is a carbonyl. Wait, but COOH has a double bond in the carbonyl, yes. So, let's count.

Wait, the structure: cyclohex-3-ene suggests one double bond in the ring. Then, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, no, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So that's another double bond. Then, the formyl group is a CHO (so another double bond). And the COOH group is another double bond. So that's four double bonds? Wait, but wait: the carboxylic acid is a ring substituent. Let me think.

Wait, the main ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond). Then, substituents: at position 2, a formyl group (CHO—so another double bond), at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH–, another double bond), and perhaps the COOH is at position 1 or another position. Wait, the original name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is in position 3? No, the numbering: cyclohexene is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, so the substituents are at 2, 5, and 1. But regardless, the starting molecule has:

- One double bond in the ring (cyclohexene).

- One double bond in the vinyl group.

- One double bond in the formyl group (CHO).

- One double bond in the COOH group (the carbonyl).

Wait, but the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so the ring itself has a double bond, and COOH has another. So that's four double bonds. Plus, any rings? The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one ring. So the total hydrogen deficiency is rings (1) + double bonds (4). Wait, wait, wait: rings and double bonds each count as one each, right? So, the index is 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = 5? But wait, maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait, the molecule is a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, one double bond). Then, the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and another position as the COOH. The COOH is a substituent, not part of a ring. So, the COOH has a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which has a double bond. The CHO is another double bond. So, the ring has one double bond. Then, substituents contribute three more double bonds (CHO, vinyl, COOH). So total of four double bonds? So 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = 5 hydrogen deficiencies. So index of 5.

But wait, the COOH's carbonyl is part of the substituent, so that's another double bond. So, the starting molecule has four double bonds and one ring, so 1 (ring) + 4 (doubles) = 5.

Now, when the reaction occurs with red phosphorus and excess HI. Let's think about what happens.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm trying to remember what this does. Oh wait! I think that when a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it leads to the formation of an iodide. Alternatively, I've heard of this reaction in the context of deoxygenation, where the aldehyde (CHO) is converted into CH2I. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Prins reaction? No, that's for alkenes and alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when an aldehyde reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a reduction. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. The Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Wait, but this is red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, maybe it's the HWE (Hoffmann–Wittig) reaction? No, that's for forming alkenes.

Alternatively, I'm confusing it with another reaction. Let's think about the products. If the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), and after reaction, perhaps that becomes CH2I. Or maybe it's converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, another angle: what is the index of hydrogen deficiency after the reaction?

After the reaction, which parts change? The formyl group would be converted. Let's say the CHO becomes CH2I. Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would it react? Or the COOH group?

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps it's a deoxygenation of the aldehyde group. Wait, I recall that in the presence of HX (like HI) and a reducing agent (like red phosphorus), the aldehyde can be reduced to a primary alcohol. But wait, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reaction where the aldehyde is converted into a methyl iodide. So, the -CHO becomes -CH2I. So, that would change one of the double bonds (the carbonyl in CHO) into a single bond, thus reducing the index by one.

So, in the starting molecule, the index was 5. If the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, that would break one double bond, so the index becomes 4. But wait, let's see.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring), the vinyl group (another double bond), the CHO (third double bond), and the COOH (fourth double bond). So that's four double bonds and one ring: index 5.

After the reaction, the CHO becomes CH2I. So that double bond (the carbonyl) is gone. So, that's minus one. So index becomes 4. But wait, the COOH group is still present. Its carbonyl is a double bond.

Wait, but what about the COOH group? Under these reaction conditions, would it react? Red phosphorus and HI—could it affect the carboxylic acid?

Hmm, carboxylic acids are usually not very reactive towards reducing agents, especially under such conditions. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is converted into something else, but I'm not sure. Let's think about what HI does. HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. But in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is also being converted. For instance, maybe the COOH is being converted into a CH2I group as well. But that's speculative. Or perhaps, more accurately, the COOH might be converted into a CH2I group via a similar mechanism as the aldehyde.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a carbonyl group, so maybe that's also being reduced. So, if both the CHO and the COOH groups are reduced, each would lose a double bond.

So, starting index was 5 (1 ring, 4 double bonds). After reaction, if two double bonds are lost, the index would be 3.

But wait, I'm not sure whether the COOH group is being affected. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is being converted into something else, like an acid chloride or an ester, but that doesn't seem to fit with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is being deprotonated and then reacts, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the overall reaction. The product is formed by reacting 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps the reaction is removing oxygen from the molecule, converting carbonyl groups into CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about the product. The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a CH2 group. So, the formyl becomes CH2I. Similarly, the COOH group (carboxylic acid) would have its carbonyl group converted into CH2I as well. So, each carbonyl group would be reduced. So, if two carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are reduced, each would lose a double bond.

So, starting index: 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds: ring, vinyl, CHO, COOH) = 5.

After reaction, these two double bonds are gone. So, the new index would be 1 (ring) + 2 (vinyl and ring) = 3.

Wait, but the ring itself has a double bond, which is part of the ring structure. So, the ring would still contribute 1 to the index.

Wait, after the reaction, the ring is still present, so that's 1. The vinyl group is still present, which is another double bond. So, total is 2. But wait, what about the other double bonds?

Wait, the starting molecule had:

- 1 ring (counts 1)

- 1 double bond in the ring (same as the ring)

- 1 double bond in the vinyl group (another)

- 1 double bond in the CHO

- 1 double bond in the COOH

So total index of 5.

If the aldehyde (CHO) is reduced to CH2I, that removes one double bond. If the COOH is reduced to CH2I, that removes another. So, the remaining double bonds are: the ring (1) and the vinyl group (1). So, index is 2.

Wait, but wait, the ring has a double bond—so that's one. Vinyl has another. So, two double bonds in total. Plus any rings: the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, so that's one. So, index is 3.

Wait, but wait. The ring itself is a cyclohexene—so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one. Vinyl has one double bond. So, after the reaction, if the CHO and COOH are converted to CH2I, the remaining double bonds are ring (1) and vinyl (1). So, index is 2.

Hmm, but I'm getting confused. Let me recount.

Original molecule:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond (so index 1 for ring, plus 1 for the double bond, but wait, index counts each ring and each double/triple bond as 1, regardless of type. So, each ring is +1, each double bond is +1, each triple bond is +2. So, the starting molecule: cyclohexene is a ring (1) and has one double bond (1), but wait, no: a cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond. So, the ring is one and the double bond is another. So, that's two. Then, the vinyl group adds another double bond (so 3), the CHO adds another (4), and the COOH adds another (5). So, index is 5.

After reaction: if the two carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are converted to CH2 groups, each losing their double bond. So, the ring is still present (1), the vinyl still has its double bond (1), and the other two (CHO and COOH) are gone. So, index becomes 2.

Wait, but the product may not have the COOH group anymore. Let me think again about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of the aldehyde and the COOH group. So, CHO becomes CH2I, and COOH becomes CH2I as well. So, the structure would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still a ring, 1)

- Vinyl group (still a double bond, 1)

So, the index is 2. But looking at the options, there's no option with 2. The options are 1, 3,5, 0.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the COOH group isn't being reduced. Wait, maybe only the aldehyde is being reduced. Let me think.

If only the aldehyde is reduced, then the index would decrease by 1, from 5 to 4. But that's not an option either.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction adds hydrogen and iodine, but doesn't necessarily remove double bonds. Alternatively, maybe the ring itself is opened. Or perhaps the vinyl group is also being hydrogenated.

Wait, the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. HI is a strong acid, and red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. So, perhaps not only the aldehyde is being reduced, but also the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond. If it's hydrogenated, that would remove the ring's double bond, converting it into a cyclohexane. So, the ring would go from having a double bond (so index +2: 1 for ring, 1 for double) to a single bond (so index +1: just the ring). So, that would decrease the index by 1.

So, starting index is 5.

If the aldehyde is reduced (losing one double bond → index down by 1), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated (another → index down by 1), then the index becomes 3.

So, let's recount:

Original index: 5.

After reaction:

- Aldehyde (CHO) → CH2I: -1.

- Ring's double bond (cyclohexene) → cyclohexane: -1.

- Vinyl group's double bond: +1.

- COOH group: still has a double bond, so +1.

Wait, but COOH would still have a double bond (the carbonyl), so that's another.

Wait, wait, no: if the COOH is not affected, then:

After reaction, the index would be:

- Ring: 1 (but without double bond, so 0? Wait, no. Wait, the ring with a double bond is a cyclohexene (so index 2: 1 for ring, 1 for double bond). If the ring's double bond is hydrogenated, the ring remains (so +1) but the double bond is gone (so -1). So, the index for the ring part is 1.

Plus, the vinyl group's double bond is still present: +1.

Plus, the aldehyde's double bond is gone: so we had +1 before, now 0.

Plus, the COOH's double bond is still present: +1.

So, total index: 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 3.

So, the index is 3. So the correct answer would be option B) 3.

Wait, but why would the ring's double bond be hydrogenated? Because HI is a source of H and I. Red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent, perhaps leading to hydrogenation of the double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are such that all carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are reduced, as well as the ring's double bond.

Wait, let's step back. Another approach: Let's think about the product structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the aldehyde and the carboxylic acid groups are both converted into CH2I groups.

So, the product would be 2-(iodomethyl)-5-vinylcyclohexane with something else.

Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring with substituents:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO)

- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-)

- At position 3: the ring has a double bond (cyclohexene)

- At another position (perhaps position 1): the carboxylic acid group (COOH).

So, when the reaction occurs, the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted to CH2I. The COOH group is converted to CH2I.

So, the substituents would be:

- Position 2: CH2I

- Position 5: CH2=CH-

- The ring is now cyclohexane (as the double bond is hydrogenated)

Plus, the COOH group at position 1 becomes CH2I.

Wait, but that depends on whether the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

So, the ring is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.

So, the product would be 2-(iodomethyl)-5-vinylcyclohexane with another substituent (CH2I) at position 1.

So, the substituents are:

- Position 1: CH2I

- Position 2: CH2I

- Position 5: CH2=CH-

So, the ring is now cyclohexane (no double bond, so no contribution from the ring itself except as a single ring).

So, the double bonds present in the product:

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → one double bond.

- The COOH group was converted to CH2I, so no more double bond there.

- The aldehyde group (CHO) converted to CH2I, so no more double bond.

- Ring is now cyclohexane, so no double bond.

So, the product has only one double bond (in the vinyl group). The rings are present as a cyclohexane (so one ring).

So, index of hydrogen deficiency is rings (1) + double bonds (1) = 2.

But wait, this isn't matching any of the options. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the vinyl group is also hydrogenated, so the product has no double bonds.

If that's the case, then the product has only the cyclohexane ring (so index 1).

But let's see: would the reaction conditions hydrogenate the vinyl group as well?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction that can add hydrogen to double bonds. So, perhaps in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would be hydrogenated to CH2–CH2. So, all double bonds would be gone.

So, in that case, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, just the ring).

- All substituents converted to single bonds.

So, index of hydrogen deficiency would be 1 (from the ring) + 0 (no double bonds) = 1.

Which is option A.

But wait, how?

Starting index was 5.

After reaction:

- Ring remains as cyclohexane (so +1 for the ring).

- All substituents: aldehyde and COOH converted to CH2I, so no double bonds.

- Vinyl group converted to single bond, so no double bond.

So, the product has only the cyclohexane ring, giving an index of 1.

Thus, the answer would be A)1.

But earlier I thought that the index would be 3. Now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, N is nitrogens.

But wait, maybe the product has different H and X counts, so perhaps I can calculate using that method.

But perhaps it's easier to think about how many rings and double bonds are present after the reaction.

But perhaps it's easier to think about the initial and final structures.

Alternative approach: The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI.

I think that in this reaction, the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I. The COOH group is converted into CH2I. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The vinyl group's double bond is also hydrogenated to a single bond.

So, the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-(iodomethyl)cyclohexane.

Wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, the starting structure:

- Cyclohexene ring with substituents: CHO at C2, CH2=CH– at C5, and COOH at C1.

After reaction:

- CHO becomes CH2I.

- COOH becomes CH2I.

- The cyclohexene ring (C3 double bond) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is hydrogenated to CH2–CH2.

So, the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-(ethyliodide)-cyclohexane. No, wait, the vinyl group would be hydrogenated to ethyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-ethylcyclohexane.

But wait, no, because the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2–CH2–, so ethyl group?

Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2–CH2, but that's actually ethyl. So, perhaps the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring.

- At C2: CH2I.

- At C5: CH2CH2 (which is ethyl).

Wait, but that can't be because the substituents were at C2 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally.

After all, the product structure would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (so one ring).

- At position 2: CH2I.

- At position 5: CH2CH2 (since the vinyl was CH2=CH–, which becomes CH2–CH2– after hydrogenation).

Wait, but CH2–CH2– would be a single bond, so it's an ethyl group.

So, the product is 2-iodomethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.

So, the rings: 1 (cyclohexane).

Double bonds: None.

So, index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

That would correspond to option A.

But wait, why would the vinyl group be hydrogenated? Because HI is a source of H, and red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So, yes, the double bonds in the vinyl group would be hydrogenated.

So, in that case, the product's index is 1.

Hmm, but wait, what about the COOH group? Oh, wait, the COOH is converted into CH2I. So, the product would have that group as CH2I, not a double bond anymore.

So, the product has:

- No double bonds.

- One ring (cyclohexane).

So, index is 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is A)1.

But wait, the options don't have 1 as the only option, but yes, option A is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought of an index of 3, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the ring's double bond is hydrogenated, the aldehyde and COOH groups are converted to CH2I, and the vinyl group is hydrogenated. So, all double bonds are gone, leaving only the ring.

So, index is 1.

So, the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds (each counted as 1) and triple bonds (counted as 2) in the molecule.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
- A cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond).
- A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2 (1 double bond).
- A vinyl group (-CH=CH-) at position 5 (1 double bond).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) (1 double bond).

Thus, the starting molecule has:
- 1 ring.
- 4 double bonds.
- Total hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = **5**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. Under these conditions:
1. The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-).
2. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-).
3. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, converting the ring into a cyclohexane ring.
4. The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH-) is hydrogenated, converting it into a single bond.

### Step 3: Analyze the product
After the reaction, the product is 2-iodomethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:
- The cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexane ring (1 ring, no double bond).
- The formyl group (-CHO) and carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are converted into -CH2I groups (no double bonds).
- The vinyl group (-CH=CH-) is hydrogenated into an ethyl group (-CH2-CH2-; no double bond).

Thus, the product has:
- 1 ring (cyclohexane).
- 0 double bonds.
- Total hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 0 (double bonds) = **1**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
The options provided are:
- A) 1
- B) 3
- C) 5
- D) 0

From the analysis, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? Because cyclohex-3-ene means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, on carbon 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO) and on carbon 5, a vinyl group (which is CH2=CH-). Oh, and it's a carboxylic acid, so there's a COOH group somewhere. Wait, in the name, the substituents are numbered. So the main chain is the cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 3, 5, and maybe another position.

Wait, the structure. Let me try drawing it mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-ene position. Then, position 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl (CH2CH2? No, wait vinyl is CH2=CH–). So, the substituents are at 2 and 5, with the double bonds in the ring and in the vinyl group.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh right! That's the reaction for the hydrolysis of a carbonyl group, but wait, no. Wait, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it's a type of reduction. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's different. Wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—I think that's used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh no, wait: that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right? Or wait, maybe it's the situation where the carbonyl is being transformed into something else.

Wait, no, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI can also be involved in the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, there's a reaction where ketones or aldehydes are treated with H2O and H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, but that's oxidation. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, wait: I think that when you have an aldehyde or ketone reacting with H2O (and perhaps an acid catalyst), it's just a hydration, but that doesn't seem right here. Wait, but wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, perhaps it's the deoxygenation reaction, where the carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is converted into a methylene group. Wait, that might be the case here.

So, the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO) at position 2. So, if that CHO is transformed, perhaps the reaction is converting the aldehyde group into a CH2 group. Because, thinking about the reaction: I remember that in the presence of a strong reducing agent, an aldehyde can be reduced to a primary alcohol, but with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, wait—another reaction: the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for introducing formyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the deoxygenation of the aldehyde. I think the reaction of aldehydes or ketones with HI and red phosphorus is known for deoxygenation, where the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the aldehyde (CHO) would become CH2. Let me think: the reaction is RCHO + HI (excess) → RCH2I + H2O? Or maybe it's a different product. Alternatively, could it be that the aldehyde group is being converted into an iodinated compound? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds in the molecule. So, if the product has fewer rings or double bonds, the index would change.

So, the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's count the hydrogen deficiencies.

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so that's 1). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has another double bond (so that's 2). The formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl, which is a double bond (so that's 3). The carboxylic acid is COOH, which is a carbonyl (but that's part of the same group as the ring, so the ring has a double bond and the COOH is a carbonyl. Wait, but COOH has a double bond in the carbonyl, yes. So, let's count.

Wait, the structure: cyclohex-3-ene suggests one double bond in the ring. Then, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, no, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So that's another double bond. Then, the formyl group is a CHO (so another double bond). And the COOH group is another double bond. So that's four double bonds? Wait, but wait: the carboxylic acid is a ring substituent. Let me think.

Wait, the main ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond). Then, substituents: at position 2, a formyl group (CHO—so another double bond), at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH–, another double bond), and perhaps the COOH is at position 1 or another position. Wait, the original name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is in position 3? No, the numbering: cyclohexene is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, so the substituents are at 2, 5, and 1. But regardless, the starting molecule has:

- One double bond in the ring (cyclohexene).

- One double bond in the vinyl group.

- One double bond in the formyl group (CHO).

- One double bond in the COOH group (the carbonyl).

Wait, but the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so the ring itself has a double bond, and COOH has another. So that's four double bonds. Plus, any rings? The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one ring. So the total hydrogen deficiency is rings (1) + double bonds (4). Wait, wait, wait: rings and double bonds each count as one each, right? So, the index is 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = 5? But wait, maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait, the molecule is a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, one double bond). Then, the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and another position as the COOH. The COOH is a substituent, not part of a ring. So, the COOH has a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which has a double bond. The CHO is another double bond. So, the ring has one double bond. Then, substituents contribute three more double bonds (CHO, vinyl, COOH). So total of four double bonds? So 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = 5 hydrogen deficiencies. So index of 5.

But wait, the COOH's carbonyl is part of the substituent, so that's another double bond. So, the starting molecule has four double bonds and one ring, so 1 (ring) + 4 (doubles) = 5.

Now, when the reaction occurs with red phosphorus and excess HI. Let's think about what happens.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm trying to remember what this does. Oh wait! I think that when a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it leads to the formation of an iodide. Alternatively, I've heard of this reaction in the context of deoxygenation, where the aldehyde (CHO) is converted into CH2I. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Prins reaction? No, that's for alkenes and alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when an aldehyde reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a reduction. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. The Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Wait, but this is red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, maybe it's the HWE (Hoffmann–Wittig) reaction? No, that's for forming alkenes.

Alternatively, I'm confusing it with another reaction. Let's think about the products. If the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), and after reaction, perhaps that becomes CH2I. Or maybe it's converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, another angle: what is the index of hydrogen deficiency after the reaction?

After the reaction, which parts change? The formyl group would be converted. Let's say the CHO becomes CH2I. Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would it react? Or the COOH group?

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps it's a deoxygenation of the aldehyde group. Wait, I recall that in the presence of HX (like HI) and a reducing agent (like red phosphorus), the aldehyde can be reduced to a primary alcohol. But wait, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reaction where the aldehyde is converted into a methyl iodide. So, the -CHO becomes -CH2I. So, that would change one of the double bonds (the carbonyl in CHO) into a single bond, thus reducing the index by one.

So, in the starting molecule, the index was 5. If the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, that would break one double bond, so the index becomes 4. But wait, let's see.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring), the vinyl group (another double bond), the CHO (third double bond), and the COOH (fourth double bond). So that's four double bonds and one ring: index 5.

After the reaction, the CHO becomes CH2I. So that double bond (the carbonyl) is gone. So, that's minus one. So index becomes 4. But wait, the COOH group is still present. Its carbonyl is a double bond.

Wait, but what about the COOH group? Under these reaction conditions, would it react? Red phosphorus and HI—could it affect the carboxylic acid?

Hmm, carboxylic acids are usually not very reactive towards reducing agents, especially under such conditions. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is converted into something else, but I'm not sure. Let's think about what HI does. HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. But in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is also being converted. For instance, maybe the COOH is being converted into a CH2I group as well. But that's speculative. Or perhaps, more accurately, the COOH might be converted into a CH2I group via a similar mechanism as the aldehyde.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a carbonyl group, so maybe that's also being reduced. So, if both the CHO and the COOH groups are reduced, each would lose a double bond.

So, starting index was 5 (1 ring, 4 double bonds). After reaction, if two double bonds are lost, the index would be 3.

But wait, I'm not sure whether the COOH group is being affected. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is being converted into something else, like an acid chloride or an ester, but that doesn't seem to fit with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is being deprotonated and then reacts, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the overall reaction. The product is formed by reacting 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps the reaction is removing oxygen from the molecule, converting carbonyl groups into CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about the product. The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a CH2 group. So, the formyl becomes CH2I. Similarly, the COOH group (carboxylic acid) would have its carbonyl group converted into CH2I as well. So, each carbonyl group would be reduced. So, if two carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are reduced, each would lose a double bond.

So, starting index: 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds: ring, vinyl, CHO, COOH) = 5.

After reaction, these two double bonds are gone. So, the new index would be 1 (ring) + 2 (vinyl and ring) = 3.

Wait, but the ring itself has a double bond, which is part of the ring structure. So, the ring would still contribute 1 to the index.

Wait, after the reaction, the ring is still present, so that's 1. The vinyl group is still present, which is another double bond. So, total is 2. But wait, what about the other double bonds?

Wait, the starting molecule had:

- 1 ring (counts 1)

- 1 double bond in the ring (same as the ring)

- 1 double bond in the vinyl group (another)

- 1 double bond in the CHO

- 1 double bond in the COOH

So total index of 5.

If the aldehyde (CHO) is reduced to CH2I, that removes one double bond. If the COOH is reduced to CH2I, that removes another. So, the remaining double bonds are: the ring (1) and the vinyl group (1). So, index is 2.

Wait, but wait, the ring has a double bond—so that's one. Vinyl has another. So, two double bonds in total. Plus any rings: the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, so that's one. So, index is 3.

Wait, but wait. The ring itself is a cyclohexene—so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one. Vinyl has one double bond. So, after the reaction, if the CHO and COOH are converted to CH2I, the remaining double bonds are ring (1) and vinyl (1). So, index is 2.

Hmm, but I'm getting confused. Let me recount.

Original molecule:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond (so index 1 for ring, plus 1 for the double bond, but wait, index counts each ring and each double/triple bond as 1, regardless of type. So, each ring is +1, each double bond is +1, each triple bond is +2. So, the starting molecule: cyclohexene is a ring (1) and has one double bond (1), but wait, no: a cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond. So, the ring is one and the double bond is another. So, that's two. Then, the vinyl group adds another double bond (so 3), the CHO adds another (4), and the COOH adds another (5). So, index is 5.

After reaction: if the two carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are converted to CH2 groups, each losing their double bond. So, the ring is still present (1), the vinyl still has its double bond (1), and the other two (CHO and COOH) are gone. So, index becomes 2.

Wait, but the product may not have the COOH group anymore. Let me think again about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of the aldehyde and the COOH group. So, CHO becomes CH2I, and COOH becomes CH2I as well. So, the structure would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still a ring, 1)

- Vinyl group (still a double bond, 1)

So, the index is 2. But looking at the options, there's no option with 2. The options are 1, 3,5, 0.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the COOH group isn't being reduced. Wait, maybe only the aldehyde is being reduced. Let me think.

If only the aldehyde is reduced, then the index would decrease by 1, from 5 to 4. But that's not an option either.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction adds hydrogen and iodine, but doesn't necessarily remove double bonds. Alternatively, maybe the ring itself is opened. Or perhaps the vinyl group is also being hydrogenated.

Wait, the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. HI is a strong acid, and red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. So, perhaps not only the aldehyde is being reduced, but also the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond. If it's hydrogenated, that would remove the ring's double bond, converting it into a cyclohexane. So, the ring would go from having a double bond (so index +2: 1 for ring, 1 for double) to a single bond (so index +1: just the ring). So, that would decrease the index by 1.

So, starting index is 5.

If the aldehyde is reduced (losing one double bond → index down by 1), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated (another → index down by 1), then the index becomes 3.

So, let's recount:

Original index: 5.

After reaction:

- Aldehyde (CHO) → CH2I: -1.

- Ring's double bond (cyclohexene) → cyclohexane: -1.

- Vinyl group's double bond: +1.

- COOH group: still has a double bond, so +1.

Wait, but COOH would still have a double bond (the carbonyl), so that's another.

Wait, wait, no: if the COOH is not affected, then:

After reaction, the index would be:

- Ring: 1 (but without double bond, so 0? Wait, no. Wait, the ring with a double bond is a cyclohexene (so index 2: 1 for ring, 1 for double bond). If the ring's double bond is hydrogenated, the ring remains (so +1) but the double bond is gone (so -1). So, the index for the ring part is 1.

Plus, the vinyl group's double bond is still present: +1.

Plus, the aldehyde's double bond is gone: so we had +1 before, now 0.

Plus, the COOH's double bond is still present: +1.

So, total index: 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 3.

So, the index is 3. So the correct answer would be option B) 3.

Wait, but why would the ring's double bond be hydrogenated? Because HI is a source of H and I. Red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent, perhaps leading to hydrogenation of the double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are such that all carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH) are reduced, as well as the ring's double bond.

Wait, let's step back. Another approach: Let's think about the product structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the aldehyde and the carboxylic acid groups are both converted into CH2I groups.

So, the product would be 2-(iodomethyl)-5-vinylcyclohexane with something else.

Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring with substituents:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO)

- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-)

- At position 3: the ring has a double bond (cyclohexene)

- At another position (perhaps position 1): the carboxylic acid group (COOH).

So, when the reaction occurs, the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted to CH2I. The COOH group is converted to CH2I.

So, the substituents would be:

- Position 2: CH2I

- Position 5: CH2=CH-

- The ring is now cyclohexane (as the double bond is hydrogenated)

Plus, the COOH group at position 1 becomes CH2I.

Wait, but that depends on whether the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

So, the ring is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.

So, the product would be 2-(iodomethyl)-5-vinylcyclohexane with another substituent (CH2I) at position 1.

So, the substituents are:

- Position 1: CH2I

- Position 2: CH2I

- Position 5: CH2=CH-

So, the ring is now cyclohexane (no double bond, so no contribution from the ring itself except as a single ring).

So, the double bonds present in the product:

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → one double bond.

- The COOH group was converted to CH2I, so no more double bond there.

- The aldehyde group (CHO) converted to CH2I, so no more double bond.

- Ring is now cyclohexane, so no double bond.

So, the product has only one double bond (in the vinyl group). The rings are present as a cyclohexane (so one ring).

So, index of hydrogen deficiency is rings (1) + double bonds (1) = 2.

But wait, this isn't matching any of the options. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the vinyl group is also hydrogenated, so the product has no double bonds.

If that's the case, then the product has only the cyclohexane ring (so index 1).

But let's see: would the reaction conditions hydrogenate the vinyl group as well?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction that can add hydrogen to double bonds. So, perhaps in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would be hydrogenated to CH2–CH2. So, all double bonds would be gone.

So, in that case, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, just the ring).

- All substituents converted to single bonds.

So, index of hydrogen deficiency would be 1 (from the ring) + 0 (no double bonds) = 1.

Which is option A.

But wait, how?

Starting index was 5.

After reaction:

- Ring remains as cyclohexane (so +1 for the ring).

- All substituents: aldehyde and COOH converted to CH2I, so no double bonds.

- Vinyl group converted to single bond, so no double bond.

So, the product has only the cyclohexane ring, giving an index of 1.

Thus, the answer would be A)1.

But earlier I thought that the index would be 3. Now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, N is nitrogens.

But wait, maybe the product has different H and X counts, so perhaps I can calculate using that method.

But perhaps it's easier to think about how many rings and double bonds are present after the reaction.

But perhaps it's easier to think about the initial and final structures.

Alternative approach: The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI.

I think that in this reaction, the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I. The COOH group is converted into CH2I. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The vinyl group's double bond is also hydrogenated to a single bond.

So, the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-(iodomethyl)cyclohexane.

Wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, the starting structure:

- Cyclohexene ring with substituents: CHO at C2, CH2=CH– at C5, and COOH at C1.

After reaction:

- CHO becomes CH2I.

- COOH becomes CH2I.

- The cyclohexene ring (C3 double bond) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is hydrogenated to CH2–CH2.

So, the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-(ethyliodide)-cyclohexane. No, wait, the vinyl group would be hydrogenated to ethyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-(iodomethyl)-5-ethylcyclohexane.

But wait, no, because the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2–CH2–, so ethyl group?

Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2–CH2, but that's actually ethyl. So, perhaps the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring.

- At C2: CH2I.

- At C5: CH2CH2 (which is ethyl).

Wait, but that can't be because the substituents were at C2 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally.

After all, the product structure would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (so one ring).

- At position 2: CH2I.

- At position 5: CH2CH2 (since the vinyl was CH2=CH–, which becomes CH2–CH2– after hydrogenation).

Wait, but CH2–CH2– would be a single bond, so it's an ethyl group.

So, the product is 2-iodomethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.

So, the rings: 1 (cyclohexane).

Double bonds: None.

So, index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

That would correspond to option A.

But wait, why would the vinyl group be hydrogenated? Because HI is a source of H, and red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So, yes, the double bonds in the vinyl group would be hydrogenated.

So, in that case, the product's index is 1.

Hmm, but wait, what about the COOH group? Oh, wait, the COOH is converted into CH2I. So, the product would have that group as CH2I, not a double bond anymore.

So, the product has:

- No double bonds.

- One ring (cyclohexane).

So, index is 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is A)1.

But wait, the options don't have 1 as the only option, but yes, option A is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought of an index of 3, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the ring's double bond is hydrogenated, the aldehyde and COOH groups are converted to CH2I, and the vinyl group is hydrogenated. So, all double bonds are gone, leaving only the ring.

So, index is 1.

So, the answer is A.


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds (each counted as 1) and triple bonds (counted as 2) in the molecule.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
- A cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond).
- A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2 (1 double bond).
- A vinyl group (-CH=CH-) at position 5 (1 double bond).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) (1 double bond).

Thus, the starting molecule has:
- 1 ring.
- 4 double bonds.
- Total hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 4 (double bonds) = **5**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. Under these conditions:
1. The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-).
2. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-).
3. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, converting the ring into a cyclohexane ring.
4. The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH-) is hydrogenated, converting it into a single bond.

### Step 3: Analyze the product
After the reaction, the product is 2-iodomethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:
- The cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexane ring (1 ring, no double bond).
- The formyl group (-CHO) and carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are converted into -CH2I groups (no double bonds).
- The vinyl group (-CH=CH-) is hydrogenated into an ethyl group (-CH2-CH2-; no double bond).

Thus, the product has:
- 1 ring (cyclohexane).
- 0 double bonds.
- Total hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 0 (double bonds) = **1**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
The options provided are:
- A) 1
- B) 3
- C) 5
- D) 0

From the analysis, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A
