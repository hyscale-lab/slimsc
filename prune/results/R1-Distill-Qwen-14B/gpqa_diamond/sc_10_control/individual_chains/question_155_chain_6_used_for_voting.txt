Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is provided as a column vector, and I need to calculate ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔP_z, I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The given state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute its norm. The elements are (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the given state is expressed in the P_z basis. So to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ, since the basis is already the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, actually, P_z is diagonal in its own basis. Let me look at the matrix form of P_z given in the problem. It's a 3x3 matrix with elements:

Row 1: [h, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -h]
Wait, but h is actually h-bar, right? Because the problem uses ħ. So P_z matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0    0  -ħ ]

So for any state, the expectation value of P_z is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is just the weighted sum.

The state |ψ> has components a, b, c: a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

So the probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2. Let's compute these.

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

Now, the eigenvalues for each basis state are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So for each component:

First component: |a|^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ
Second component: |b|^2 * 0 = 0
Third component: |c|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)*(-ħ)

So ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Wait, but I should double-check that. Because the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component's eigenvalue is directly multiplied by the squared magnitude of the component. So yes, that's correct.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z squared would be:

[ (ħ)^2   0       0    ]
[ 0       0       0    ]
[ 0       0      (-ħ)^2 ]

Which is:

[ ħ²   0    0 ]
[ 0    0    0 ]
[ 0    0   ħ² ]

Wait, no, wait. Because (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So all diagonal elements are either ħ², 0, or ħ² again. Wait, no, the third diagonal element is (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

Wait, the original P_z matrix is [ ħ, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0,-ħ ]. So when we square that, each diagonal element becomes (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2. So the diagonal elements of P_z² are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, when calculating ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of the components |a|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ)^2.

So substituting the values:

|a|^2 = 1/4, so (1/4) * ħ²
|b|^2 = 1/2, but multiplied by 0 → 0
|c|^2 = 1/4, so (1/4) * ħ²
Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2), so that's the answer.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the state vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, weighted by the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states.

The squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with diagonal elements being the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, so the eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$.

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is provided as a column vector, and I need to calculate ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔP_z, I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The given state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute its norm. The elements are (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the given state is expressed in the P_z basis. So to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ, since the basis is already the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, actually, P_z is diagonal in its own basis. Let me look at the matrix form of P_z given in the problem. It's a 3x3 matrix with elements:

Row 1: [h, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -h]
Wait, but h is actually h-bar, right? Because the problem uses ħ. So P_z matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0    0  -ħ ]

So for any state, the expectation value of P_z is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is just the weighted sum.

The state |ψ> has components a, b, c: a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

So the probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2. Let's compute these.

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

Now, the eigenvalues for each basis state are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So for each component:

First component: |a|^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ
Second component: |b|^2 * 0 = 0
Third component: |c|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)*(-ħ)

So ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Wait, but I should double-check that. Because the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component's eigenvalue is directly multiplied by the squared magnitude of the component. So yes, that's correct.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z squared would be:

[ (ħ)^2   0       0    ]
[ 0       0       0    ]
[ 0       0      (-ħ)^2 ]

Which is:

[ ħ²   0    0 ]
[ 0    0    0 ]
[ 0    0   ħ² ]

Wait, no, wait. Because (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So all diagonal elements are either ħ², 0, or ħ² again. Wait, no, the third diagonal element is (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

Wait, the original P_z matrix is [ ħ, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0,-ħ ]. So when we square that, each diagonal element becomes (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2. So the diagonal elements of P_z² are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, when calculating ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of the components |a|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ)^2.

So substituting the values:

|a|^2 = 1/4, so (1/4) * ħ²
|b|^2 = 1/2, but multiplied by 0 → 0
|c|^2 = 1/4, so (1/4) * ħ²
Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2), so that's the answer.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the state vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, weighted by the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states.

The squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with diagonal elements being the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, so the eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$.

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
