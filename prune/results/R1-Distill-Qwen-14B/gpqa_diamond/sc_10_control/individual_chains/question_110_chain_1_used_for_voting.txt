Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the V magnitude is a measure of brightness, but lower numbers mean brighter stars. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because like, a magnitude of 1 is brighter than 6. So, ESPRESSO can see stars with V <17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So V <16.

So, a star must be observable by both if it's V magnitude is less than both 17 and 16, which would mean it must be less than 16. So a star that's V=15 would be okay, but V=16.5 wouldn't because HIRES can't see beyond 16.

Wait, no, wait again. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, so if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it's observed. So, if a star is V=16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Same for HIRES: "brighter than 16 V mag", so V<16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So both can see it.

Wait, but wait. Are we talking about apparent or absolute magnitude here? Because the question mentions the apparent V magnitude for some stars, and for others, absolute magnitude and distance. Oh right, because some stars have apparent V given, others we have to calculate.

So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust reddening), and then see if that apparent V is less than 16. If it is, then both telescopes can see it.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So I can calculate its apparent magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10, log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5 +5*1 = 25.5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Oh yes, I think I messed up. Let me redo.

The correct formula is m = M + 5*(log10(d) -1). So for d=10 pc, log10(10) is 1. So 5*(1-1)=0. So m = M =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Now, what about extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so I think we can assume no reddening. So m=15.5. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. So it's less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it because 15.5 <16. So Star1 is a candidate.

Wait, but wait, no, check the numbers again. Because ESPRESSO can see up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So Star1's m=15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. ESPRESSO can definitely see it. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: apparent V is 16.5. So, is 16.5 less than 16? No. So HIRES can't see it. So for both, Star2 is out.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, but wait, no, wait.

Wait, Star3 has an E(B-V) of 0.6. Oh, so there's extinction. The question mentions that the total absorption (extinction) in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. Wait, wait, in the V band, the extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + A_V. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the observed magnitude is dimmer, so the apparent magnitude increases because extinction makes it appear fainter. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction.

Wait, but wait, actually, the star's light is dimmed, so the apparent magnitude is higher. So if the star's actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m, then with extinction, it's m + A_V.

Wait, but wait, in this case, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before considering extinction, right? Because the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6..." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but extinction would make it appear fainter. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = 15.5 + 3.1 * 0.6 = 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says that the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's without considering extinction. Because E(B-V) is given, which is the color excess, so probably the star's light is reddened. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m + A_V. So m_observed = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So that's higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But wait, ESPRESSO can see up to 17. So m_observed is 17.36, which is higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it either. So Star3 cannot be detected by either. So Star3 is out.

Wait, no, maybe I messed up. Let me read the question again. For Star3: the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but perhaps that's after reddening. Or before. Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. The question says: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.'

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which means that the star's light is redder than it actually is. So the extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the star's observed V magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So m=17.36. So with HIRES, which can see up to V=16, this is too faint. So Star3 can't be seen by either. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, located at 10 pc. So let's compute the apparent magnitude without extinction. Using the formula m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). d=10, so log d=1, so m=15.5 +5*(1-1)=15.5. Now, the E(B-V) is 0.4, so A_V =3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74, which is greater than 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.74 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star4 is visible only by ESPRESSO, not both. So Star4 is not a candidate for both.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Star4's apparent mag without extinction is 15.5. With extinction, m =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, 16.74 is too high. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So Star4 is out.

Star5: Absolute V magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc. Let's compute its apparent magnitude. So m = M +5*(log10(5) -1). Log10(5) is about 0.69897, so 0.69897 -1 = -0.30103. Multiply by 5: 5*(-0.30103) = -1.50515. So m=16.5 -1.50515 ≈14.995, which is about 15.0. Now, any extinction? I don't see E(B-V) given for Star5, so perhaps it's zero. So m=15.0. So both telescopes can see it because 15 <16 and 15 <17. So Star5 is a candidate.

So the stars that can be observed by both are Star1 and Star5?

Wait, but let's double-check each star:

Star1: m=15.5. No extinction. So apparent V is 15.5. Both can detect (as 15.5 <16 and <17). So yes.

Star5: m=15.0. No extinction. So both can detect.

Wait, but the options don't include Star1 and Star5. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so according to my analysis, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't have that combination. Wait, did I miscalculate something?

Wait, let me recheck the stars. Maybe I made a mistake in Star1. Let's go back.

Star1: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Because d=10, log10(10)=1. So 5*1=5. So m =15.5 +5 -5=15.5. Correct.

So Star1's m is 15.5. So for HIRES, m must be less than 16, which 15.5 is. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star5: m=15.0, so yes for both.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes Star5 is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option A (Star4 and Star5). But Star3 can't be detected by either, and Star4 only by ESPRESSO. So maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5's distance. Star5 is at 5 pc.

Wait, for Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

So m = M +5*(log10(5) -1). Let me compute log10(5)=0.69897. So log10(5) -1= -0.30103. Multiply by 5: -1.50515. So m =16.5 -1.50515= about 14.995, which is 15.0. So yes, m=15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0, which is less than 16 and 17, so both can detect.

So the two stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options have both. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm. So according to my analysis, Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0) can be detected by both. So the correct answer should be a combination of these two, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Star5. Let me check again.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc.

m = M +5*(log10(5) -1).

log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5*(0.69897-1)=5*(-0.30103)= -1.50515.

So m=16.5 -1.50515=15.0, correct.

So with no extinction, Star5 would have m=15.0.

So both can see it.

Now, looking again at the options, perhaps I missed that Star5 is not in any option that includes a star that can be seen by both.

Wait, the options are A to D, and none of them include Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Star1 and Star4.

Wait, but Star4's m is 16.74, which is not <16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star4.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 => A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74, which is greater than 16. So only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So the only stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again about the apparent magnitude calculation.

Wait, the formula for calculating apparent magnitude from absolute magnitude is:

m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10 pc )

Which is same as m = M +5*(log10 d -1).

So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1, so m = M +5*(1-1)= M. So Star1 has m=15.5.

Star5: d=5 pc. log10(5)=0.69897.

So m=16.5 +5*(0.69897-1) =16.5 +5*(-0.30103)=16.5 -1.50515=14.99485 ≈15.0.

So that's correct.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that combination. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction for Star3.

Wait, Star3: the apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V) of 0.6.

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude. So to find the intrinsic magnitude, we have to subtract the extinction.

Wait, that would change things. Let me think again.

If the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but it's affected by extinction (dust), then the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_true = m_observed - A_V.

So A_V=3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, that's a much brighter star. Because the extinction makes it appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is higher than the true.

So if m_observed=15.5, then m_true=13.64.

So for Star3, m_true is 13.64. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude is 13.64.

But wait, that's without considering the distance. Wait, no, the distance is given, but wait, the apparent magnitude would be calculated from the absolute magnitude and distance, but if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction, then what's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude after extinction. So the true apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - A_V.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without extinction.

When a star is at distance d, the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = M +5 log10(d/10) = M +5(log10 d -1).

But if there's extinction, the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m + A_V.

So in the case of Star3, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction.

So m_observed = m_true + A_V.

So m_true = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, that would mean that the apparent magnitude without extinction is 13.64, which is way brighter than 15.5. So the star would be brighter than the 15.5 mag.

But then, can we compute the absolute magnitude from that?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

Each star's apparent magnitude (as observed) must be less than 16 (for HIRES) and less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) to be detectable by both.

So for each star, calculate the observed apparent magnitude, considering any extinction, and see if it's <16.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. So yes for both.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES requires <16, so no.

Star3: m_observed is given as 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So observed m = m_true + A_V. Wait, no, the given m is already the observed. So m_observed =15.5. With A_V=1.86, that is, the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's without extinction.

Wait, but wait, if the observed m is 15.5, which includes extinction, then to find the true m, it's 13.64. But that doesn't affect the detectability because the observed m is 15.5. Wait, no, the observed m is 15.5, which is what the telescope measures. So if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, is that less than 16? Yes. So HIRES can detect it because 15.5 <16.

Wait, but wait! Oh, no! Because the question says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's the apparent magnitude observed, including extinction. So m_observed=15.5. So for HIRES, which requires m<16, 15.5 is acceptable. So Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's observed m is 17.36, but that's only if the apparent magnitude is calculated as m=15.5 +1.86 =17.36. But now I'm getting confused because the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, so perhaps that's the observed magnitude, and extinction doesn't need to be applied again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify:

If a star's apparent magnitude is given as m, that's the observed value, already including any extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is after considering extinction. So no need to add A_V again. So Star3's m is 15.5.

So Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. And ESPRESSO can see it as 15.5<17. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, this changes everything. I think I made a mistake earlier by adding the extinction again to an already observed magnitude.

So let me reevaluate each star:

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. Both can see.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't see (needs <16). So no.

Star3: m=15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, which is still less than 16. So both can see.

Star4: m=15.5 (no extinction?), but wait, Star4's m has to be computed from M and distance, considering extinction.

Wait, Star4's data:

Absolute V magnitude: 15.5.

Distance:10 pc.

So, m_true (without extinction) is M +5(log10(10) -1) =15.5 +0=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So the observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it.

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction. Both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but let's check:

Star3: m=15.5, which is <16 and <17. So yes.

Star1: m=15.5, same.

Star5: m=15.0, same.

So which of these stars are in the options?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

So if both Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, then option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m was 15.5, which is acceptable. But earlier, I thought the given m for Star3 was before considering extinction. So perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, the question says for Star3: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.'

But if the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's already the observed value. Because if the apparent magnitude was calculated without extinction, and then extinction is applied, then the observed m would be larger. But the way the question is phrased, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to interpret it is:

For Star1, Star4, and Star5, the absolute magnitude and distance are given, so we must compute their apparent magnitude without extinction, and then add the extinction (if any) to find the observed m.

But for Star2 and Star3, the apparent magnitude is given, which might include or exclude extinction.

This is a bit confusing.

Alternative approach:

Each star's apparent magnitude after considering extinction must be less than 16 for both telescopes to detect.

So for each star:

Calculate m_observed = (calculated apparent magnitude) + A_V.

Except for the stars where the apparent magnitude is given, which may already include extinction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the way to look at it is:

- For stars with given apparent magnitudes (like Star2 and Star3), if they have E(B-V), then the observed m is m + A_V.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the given apparent magnitude is observed, then extinction is already included.

So perhaps in Star2 and Star3, the given m is the observed (after extinction), so no need to add A_V again.

In that case:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction.

m =15.5. So m_observed=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=0.6. A_V=1.86. So m_observed =16.5 +1.86=18.36? No, that can't be right because if the given m is already observed, then you don't add A_V again.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to find a clear approach.

The correct way is:

- For stars where the apparent magnitude is given, if E(B-V) is provided, then the observed m is m + A_V.

Wait, no. The observed m is the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth, which already accounts for extinction. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true, and it has extinction A_V, then the observed m is m_true + A_V.

But when the problem gives "apparent V magnitude", that's the observed value. So for Star2, the m is 16.5, which includes A_V.

But wait, no. Because if the star is at a certain distance, the apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

So when you're given m as apparent magnitude, that's the observed value, which includes A_V.

So for Star2: m=16.5 (observed). So for HIRES, which requires m <16, it's too faint.

For Star3: m=15.5 (observed), which is <16. So both can detect.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m_true (without extinction) is 15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4→A_V=1.24.

So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74. So >16. HIRES can't detect.

Star5: m=15.0 (observed, no extinction). Both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, Star1's m is 15.5, which is <16. So it can be detected by both.

So why isn't Star1 in the options? Because the options don't include it. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, Star1's data:

Star1 has M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m_true (without extinction) is 15.5. No E(B-V) given, so A_V=0. So m_observed=15.5.

So both can detect.

So why isn't Star1 included in any option?

Looking again at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So if Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, and Star1 can as well, but the only option that includes any of them is B and D.

Hmm. But according to this, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but in this scenario, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is acceptable by both.

Star5's m_observed is 15.0.

So the correct answer should include both.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought that Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is acceptable. But when the question says that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, perhaps this 15.5 is the true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude, not the observed. That would change things.

Wait, that's the confusion. Let me clarify:

If the question says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then the observed m is 15.5 + A_V.

So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So in that case, Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it.

But earlier, I thought that the apparent magnitude given already includes extinction, so m_observed=15.5.

This is the crux of the confusion.

The question says: for Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..."

So, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed (after extinction). So no need to add A_V again. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5.

Thus, it can be detected by both.

So in that case, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, making option B correct.

But wait, Star5's m is 15.0, which is also acceptable.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering extinction where applicable. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). A star must satisfy $m < 16$ to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
- No extinction is mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$  
- Extinction is not mentioned.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 16.5 > 16$, so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES.

#### **Star3**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
- Total absorption in V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]  
- The question does not explicitly state whether the given $m = 15.5$ includes extinction. Assuming it is the observed magnitude (already accounting for extinction), $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star4**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
- Total absorption in V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
- Observed magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 16.74 > 16$, so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES.

#### **Star5**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 16.5$  
- Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 = 16.5 - 1.50515 \approx 15.0
  \]  
- No extinction is mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.0$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.0 < 16$, so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.  
**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the V magnitude is a measure of brightness, but lower numbers mean brighter stars. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because like, a magnitude of 1 is brighter than 6. So, ESPRESSO can see stars with V <17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So V <16.

So, a star must be observable by both if it's V magnitude is less than both 17 and 16, which would mean it must be less than 16. So a star that's V=15 would be okay, but V=16.5 wouldn't because HIRES can't see beyond 16.

Wait, no, wait again. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, so if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it's observed. So, if a star is V=16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Same for HIRES: "brighter than 16 V mag", so V<16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So both can see it.

Wait, but wait. Are we talking about apparent or absolute magnitude here? Because the question mentions the apparent V magnitude for some stars, and for others, absolute magnitude and distance. Oh right, because some stars have apparent V given, others we have to calculate.

So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust reddening), and then see if that apparent V is less than 16. If it is, then both telescopes can see it.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So I can calculate its apparent magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10, log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5 +5*1 = 25.5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Oh yes, I think I messed up. Let me redo.

The correct formula is m = M + 5*(log10(d) -1). So for d=10 pc, log10(10) is 1. So 5*(1-1)=0. So m = M =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Now, what about extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so I think we can assume no reddening. So m=15.5. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. So it's less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it because 15.5 <16. So Star1 is a candidate.

Wait, but wait, no, check the numbers again. Because ESPRESSO can see up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So Star1's m=15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. ESPRESSO can definitely see it. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: apparent V is 16.5. So, is 16.5 less than 16? No. So HIRES can't see it. So for both, Star2 is out.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, but wait, no, wait.

Wait, Star3 has an E(B-V) of 0.6. Oh, so there's extinction. The question mentions that the total absorption (extinction) in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. Wait, wait, in the V band, the extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + A_V. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the observed magnitude is dimmer, so the apparent magnitude increases because extinction makes it appear fainter. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction.

Wait, but wait, actually, the star's light is dimmed, so the apparent magnitude is higher. So if the star's actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m, then with extinction, it's m + A_V.

Wait, but wait, in this case, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before considering extinction, right? Because the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6..." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but extinction would make it appear fainter. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = 15.5 + 3.1 * 0.6 = 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says that the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's without considering extinction. Because E(B-V) is given, which is the color excess, so probably the star's light is reddened. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m + A_V. So m_observed = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So that's higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But wait, ESPRESSO can see up to 17. So m_observed is 17.36, which is higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it either. So Star3 cannot be detected by either. So Star3 is out.

Wait, no, maybe I messed up. Let me read the question again. For Star3: the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but perhaps that's after reddening. Or before. Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. The question says: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.'

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which means that the star's light is redder than it actually is. So the extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the star's observed V magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So m=17.36. So with HIRES, which can see up to V=16, this is too faint. So Star3 can't be seen by either. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, located at 10 pc. So let's compute the apparent magnitude without extinction. Using the formula m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). d=10, so log d=1, so m=15.5 +5*(1-1)=15.5. Now, the E(B-V) is 0.4, so A_V =3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74, which is greater than 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.74 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star4 is visible only by ESPRESSO, not both. So Star4 is not a candidate for both.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Star4's apparent mag without extinction is 15.5. With extinction, m =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, 16.74 is too high. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So Star4 is out.

Star5: Absolute V magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc. Let's compute its apparent magnitude. So m = M +5*(log10(5) -1). Log10(5) is about 0.69897, so 0.69897 -1 = -0.30103. Multiply by 5: 5*(-0.30103) = -1.50515. So m=16.5 -1.50515 ≈14.995, which is about 15.0. Now, any extinction? I don't see E(B-V) given for Star5, so perhaps it's zero. So m=15.0. So both telescopes can see it because 15 <16 and 15 <17. So Star5 is a candidate.

So the stars that can be observed by both are Star1 and Star5?

Wait, but let's double-check each star:

Star1: m=15.5. No extinction. So apparent V is 15.5. Both can detect (as 15.5 <16 and <17). So yes.

Star5: m=15.0. No extinction. So both can detect.

Wait, but the options don't include Star1 and Star5. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so according to my analysis, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't have that combination. Wait, did I miscalculate something?

Wait, let me recheck the stars. Maybe I made a mistake in Star1. Let's go back.

Star1: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Because d=10, log10(10)=1. So 5*1=5. So m =15.5 +5 -5=15.5. Correct.

So Star1's m is 15.5. So for HIRES, m must be less than 16, which 15.5 is. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star5: m=15.0, so yes for both.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes Star5 is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option A (Star4 and Star5). But Star3 can't be detected by either, and Star4 only by ESPRESSO. So maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5's distance. Star5 is at 5 pc.

Wait, for Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

So m = M +5*(log10(5) -1). Let me compute log10(5)=0.69897. So log10(5) -1= -0.30103. Multiply by 5: -1.50515. So m =16.5 -1.50515= about 14.995, which is 15.0. So yes, m=15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0, which is less than 16 and 17, so both can detect.

So the two stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options have both. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm. So according to my analysis, Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0) can be detected by both. So the correct answer should be a combination of these two, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Star5. Let me check again.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc.

m = M +5*(log10(5) -1).

log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5*(0.69897-1)=5*(-0.30103)= -1.50515.

So m=16.5 -1.50515=15.0, correct.

So with no extinction, Star5 would have m=15.0.

So both can see it.

Now, looking again at the options, perhaps I missed that Star5 is not in any option that includes a star that can be seen by both.

Wait, the options are A to D, and none of them include Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Star1 and Star4.

Wait, but Star4's m is 16.74, which is not <16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star4.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 => A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74, which is greater than 16. So only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So the only stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again about the apparent magnitude calculation.

Wait, the formula for calculating apparent magnitude from absolute magnitude is:

m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10 pc )

Which is same as m = M +5*(log10 d -1).

So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1, so m = M +5*(1-1)= M. So Star1 has m=15.5.

Star5: d=5 pc. log10(5)=0.69897.

So m=16.5 +5*(0.69897-1) =16.5 +5*(-0.30103)=16.5 -1.50515=14.99485 ≈15.0.

So that's correct.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that combination. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction for Star3.

Wait, Star3: the apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V) of 0.6.

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude. So to find the intrinsic magnitude, we have to subtract the extinction.

Wait, that would change things. Let me think again.

If the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but it's affected by extinction (dust), then the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_true = m_observed - A_V.

So A_V=3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, that's a much brighter star. Because the extinction makes it appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is higher than the true.

So if m_observed=15.5, then m_true=13.64.

So for Star3, m_true is 13.64. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude is 13.64.

But wait, that's without considering the distance. Wait, no, the distance is given, but wait, the apparent magnitude would be calculated from the absolute magnitude and distance, but if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction, then what's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude after extinction. So the true apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - A_V.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without extinction.

When a star is at distance d, the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = M +5 log10(d/10) = M +5(log10 d -1).

But if there's extinction, the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m + A_V.

So in the case of Star3, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction.

So m_observed = m_true + A_V.

So m_true = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, that would mean that the apparent magnitude without extinction is 13.64, which is way brighter than 15.5. So the star would be brighter than the 15.5 mag.

But then, can we compute the absolute magnitude from that?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

Each star's apparent magnitude (as observed) must be less than 16 (for HIRES) and less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) to be detectable by both.

So for each star, calculate the observed apparent magnitude, considering any extinction, and see if it's <16.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. So yes for both.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES requires <16, so no.

Star3: m_observed is given as 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So observed m = m_true + A_V. Wait, no, the given m is already the observed. So m_observed =15.5. With A_V=1.86, that is, the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's without extinction.

Wait, but wait, if the observed m is 15.5, which includes extinction, then to find the true m, it's 13.64. But that doesn't affect the detectability because the observed m is 15.5. Wait, no, the observed m is 15.5, which is what the telescope measures. So if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, is that less than 16? Yes. So HIRES can detect it because 15.5 <16.

Wait, but wait! Oh, no! Because the question says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's the apparent magnitude observed, including extinction. So m_observed=15.5. So for HIRES, which requires m<16, 15.5 is acceptable. So Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's observed m is 17.36, but that's only if the apparent magnitude is calculated as m=15.5 +1.86 =17.36. But now I'm getting confused because the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, so perhaps that's the observed magnitude, and extinction doesn't need to be applied again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify:

If a star's apparent magnitude is given as m, that's the observed value, already including any extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is after considering extinction. So no need to add A_V again. So Star3's m is 15.5.

So Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. And ESPRESSO can see it as 15.5<17. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, this changes everything. I think I made a mistake earlier by adding the extinction again to an already observed magnitude.

So let me reevaluate each star:

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. Both can see.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't see (needs <16). So no.

Star3: m=15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, which is still less than 16. So both can see.

Star4: m=15.5 (no extinction?), but wait, Star4's m has to be computed from M and distance, considering extinction.

Wait, Star4's data:

Absolute V magnitude: 15.5.

Distance:10 pc.

So, m_true (without extinction) is M +5(log10(10) -1) =15.5 +0=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So the observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it.

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction. Both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but let's check:

Star3: m=15.5, which is <16 and <17. So yes.

Star1: m=15.5, same.

Star5: m=15.0, same.

So which of these stars are in the options?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

So if both Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, then option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m was 15.5, which is acceptable. But earlier, I thought the given m for Star3 was before considering extinction. So perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, the question says for Star3: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.'

But if the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's already the observed value. Because if the apparent magnitude was calculated without extinction, and then extinction is applied, then the observed m would be larger. But the way the question is phrased, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to interpret it is:

For Star1, Star4, and Star5, the absolute magnitude and distance are given, so we must compute their apparent magnitude without extinction, and then add the extinction (if any) to find the observed m.

But for Star2 and Star3, the apparent magnitude is given, which might include or exclude extinction.

This is a bit confusing.

Alternative approach:

Each star's apparent magnitude after considering extinction must be less than 16 for both telescopes to detect.

So for each star:

Calculate m_observed = (calculated apparent magnitude) + A_V.

Except for the stars where the apparent magnitude is given, which may already include extinction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the way to look at it is:

- For stars with given apparent magnitudes (like Star2 and Star3), if they have E(B-V), then the observed m is m + A_V.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the given apparent magnitude is observed, then extinction is already included.

So perhaps in Star2 and Star3, the given m is the observed (after extinction), so no need to add A_V again.

In that case:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction.

m =15.5. So m_observed=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=0.6. A_V=1.86. So m_observed =16.5 +1.86=18.36? No, that can't be right because if the given m is already observed, then you don't add A_V again.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to find a clear approach.

The correct way is:

- For stars where the apparent magnitude is given, if E(B-V) is provided, then the observed m is m + A_V.

Wait, no. The observed m is the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth, which already accounts for extinction. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true, and it has extinction A_V, then the observed m is m_true + A_V.

But when the problem gives "apparent V magnitude", that's the observed value. So for Star2, the m is 16.5, which includes A_V.

But wait, no. Because if the star is at a certain distance, the apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

So when you're given m as apparent magnitude, that's the observed value, which includes A_V.

So for Star2: m=16.5 (observed). So for HIRES, which requires m <16, it's too faint.

For Star3: m=15.5 (observed), which is <16. So both can detect.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m_true (without extinction) is 15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4→A_V=1.24.

So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74. So >16. HIRES can't detect.

Star5: m=15.0 (observed, no extinction). Both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, Star1's m is 15.5, which is <16. So it can be detected by both.

So why isn't Star1 in the options? Because the options don't include it. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, Star1's data:

Star1 has M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m_true (without extinction) is 15.5. No E(B-V) given, so A_V=0. So m_observed=15.5.

So both can detect.

So why isn't Star1 included in any option?

Looking again at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So if Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, and Star1 can as well, but the only option that includes any of them is B and D.

Hmm. But according to this, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but in this scenario, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is acceptable by both.

Star5's m_observed is 15.0.

So the correct answer should include both.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought that Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is acceptable. But when the question says that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, perhaps this 15.5 is the true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude, not the observed. That would change things.

Wait, that's the confusion. Let me clarify:

If the question says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then the observed m is 15.5 + A_V.

So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So in that case, Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it.

But earlier, I thought that the apparent magnitude given already includes extinction, so m_observed=15.5.

This is the crux of the confusion.

The question says: for Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..."

So, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed (after extinction). So no need to add A_V again. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5.

Thus, it can be detected by both.

So in that case, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, making option B correct.

But wait, Star5's m is 15.0, which is also acceptable.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering extinction where applicable. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). A star must satisfy $m < 16$ to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
- No extinction is mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$  
- Extinction is not mentioned.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 16.5 > 16$, so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES.

#### **Star3**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
- Total absorption in V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]  
- The question does not explicitly state whether the given $m = 15.5$ includes extinction. Assuming it is the observed magnitude (already accounting for extinction), $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star4**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
- Total absorption in V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
- Observed magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 16.74 > 16$, so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES.

#### **Star5**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 16.5$  
- Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 = 16.5 - 1.50515 \approx 15.0
  \]  
- No extinction is mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.0$.  
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.0 < 16$, so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
