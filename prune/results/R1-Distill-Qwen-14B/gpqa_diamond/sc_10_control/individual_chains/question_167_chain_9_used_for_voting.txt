Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are more complex, like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Wait, so this is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, so their superposition should be non-Gaussian, especially for certain values of phi and alpha.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me write that down: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) e^{-2α²}).

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is a measure of how different two probability distributions are. In quantum terms, it's used here to compare the non-Gaussian state's entropy with that of a Gaussian state. The difference in entropies would give the non-Gaussianity.

So the task is to compute this del_b for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition, so rho = |psi><psi|. Let me compute that.

But before that, perhaps I should compute N. Let's plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha =0.5.

Compute sin(2phi): 2phi is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²): alpha is 0.5, so alpha² is 0.25. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2phi)* exp(...) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + that value). So 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Compute cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Cos is even, so cos(pi/4)=√2/2 ≈0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -√2/2 ≈-0.7071.

So the state becomes approximately [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Alternatively, factor out 0.7071: [ |0.5> - | -0.5> ] multiplied by 0.7071 /0.6275.

Wait, 0.7071 divided by 0.6275 is approx 1.127. So |psi> ≈ 1.127 (|0.5> - |-0.5>).

But maybe I don't need the exact state vector right now. Let me think about the non-Gaussianity measure. The measure is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau, the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but what is tau? The reference Gaussian state. Since the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a coherent state with the same displacement as the original, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a thermal state or something else.

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which one? Because the choice of tau can affect the calculation. But perhaps the problem is considering the reference state as the closest Gaussian state to the given state, so the minimal relative entropy. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps for a two-mode cat state, the reference Gaussian state is a squeezed vacuum or something else, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps for the relative entropy, the reference state is the state that minimizes Tr(rho ln tau), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the relative entropy is given as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Wait, no. The formula is Tr(rho ln rho) is the entropy S(rho), and similarly for tau. So del_b is the difference in the entropies.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the measure. Because relative entropy is usually a directed measure, meaning S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where the latter is Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau). Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me correct that.

The relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence) between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the formula given here is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit different. So it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau.

Wait, so del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). That's the measure they're using here. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in von Neumann entropies between the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state.

But wait, Gaussian states have certain entropy properties. For example, coherent states are pure, so their entropy is zero. Squeezed states are also pure, so their entropy is zero. But mixed Gaussian states, like thermal states, have non-zero entropy.

So if the given state is a non-Gaussian state (a cat state), then rho would be a mixed state, I believe. Because when you take a superposition of coherent states, the density matrix becomes a mixture of terms, leading to decoherence and thus mixedness. So S(rho) would be positive.

On the other hand, the reference Gaussian state tau would have some entropy S(tau). But what is tau? Maybe the reference is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for the relative entropy measure, tau is a specific Gaussian state, like the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the completely mixed state, but that might not make sense because Gaussian states can have varying entropies.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the reference Gaussian state tau is the most mixed Gaussian state possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific form of rho and then compute its von Neumann entropy.

So rho is |psi><psi|. Let me compute rho.

The state |psi> is a normalized state, so rho = |psi><psi|.

Given that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, and the state is a superposition of these, the density matrix rho would be:

rho = (|alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) | -alpha><-alpha| + sin(2phi) |alpha><-alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + cos(2phi) | -alpha><alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / N^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute rho as |psi><psi|.

Wait, the state is:

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So the density matrix is:

rho = ( |alpha><alpha| cos^2(phi) + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N^2.

Wait, because when you multiply [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] by its conjugate transpose, you get:

cos^2(phi)|alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|.

But because |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. But when you take |alpha><-alpha|, that's not diagonal in the number basis. How does that affect the density matrix?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the purity or the von Neumann entropy directly.

Wait, another approach: The von Neumann entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). But rho is a pure state if the state is a superposition, but wait, is |psi> a pure state?

Wait, no. Wait, because |psi> is normalized. So rho is a pure state, right? Because |psi> is a normalized vector, so rho = |psi><psi| is a pure state, and hence S(rho) = 0? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if |psi> is a pure state, then rho is pure, and hence S(rho) is zero. But wait, that can't be right, because the relative entropy measure would then be [0 - S(tau)].

Hmm, but wait, the problem is about non-Gaussianity. For a pure state, the entropy is zero. So if tau is a Gaussian pure state (like a coherent state), then S(tau) would also be zero. Thus, del_b would be zero, which would suggest the non-Gaussianity is zero, but that's not correct because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have misunderstood something.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a mixed state. No, wait, the state is a pure state because it's a normalized superposition of two coherent states. So rho has rank 1, and S(rho) is zero.

Wait, this is confusing. If rho is a pure state, then its entropy S(rho) is zero. But if tau is a Gaussian pure state, then its entropy is also zero. So del_b would be zero, which suggests the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is not necessarily pure. Maybe tau is a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the one that is closest to rho in some sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of rho. The given state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. But the reference state tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a thermal state or a squeezed state, but if it's a Gaussian pure state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b would be zero in that case.

But this can't be because the problem is asking for non-zero non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in fact considering the relative entropy in a different way. Wait, the formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. But for a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. If tau is a Gaussian pure state, Tr(tau ln tau) is also zero. So del_b would be zero. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the relative entropy measure here. Wait, maybe the formula is actually the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is Tr(rho ln (rho/tau)). Then, that would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the given formula is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

Wait, that's different. The given formula is not the standard relative entropy. The standard relative entropy is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). So the given del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), which is the difference in their entropies.

But if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, and if tau is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0.

But that can't be correct for this problem because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Therefore, perhaps tau is not a pure Gaussian state but a mixed Gaussian state. For example, if the reference Gaussian state is a completely mixed state, then S(tau) would be maximum, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to rho, such that tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me think about the structure of rho.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix rho would have terms like |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, and cross terms |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|.

In the Fock basis, the cross terms would involve terms like |n> <m|, where n and m are different. Because coherent states have Poissonian distributions, the off-diagonal terms would have elements that are not Gaussian.

Now, the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state would compare their entropies. But if rho is a pure state, perhaps tau is a different state. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem is looking for the non-Gaussianity in a different way. Perhaps the given state is not a pure state but a mixed state, but that can't be because |psi> is normalized.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the state is not a product state, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should compute N, rho, and then find the entropy of rho and some reference Gaussian state.

Given phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

Compute N as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}).

Compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N is approximately 0.6275.

Now, express rho.

rho = ( |alpha><alpha| cos^2(phi) + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N^2.

Wait, because when you expand |psi><psi|, each term's coefficient is [cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] multiplied by [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ], divided by N^2.

So the cross terms will have coefficients cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{- alpha^2} times the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>?

Wait, the inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2 - | - alpha |^2} ... wait, no. Wait, coherent states are defined as |alpha> = e^{-|alpha|²/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. So <alpha | beta> = e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{alpha* beta}.

So for <alpha | -alpha>, that would be e^{ - ( alpha² + (-alpha)^2 ) / 2 } e^{ alpha*(-alpha) }.

Since alpha is real (I think in this problem, alpha is a real number, because it's used as |-alpha>), so alpha is real. So alpha squared is alpha^2, same for (-alpha)^2. So the exponent is e^{ - (alpha² + alpha²)/2 } e^{ - alpha^2 }.

So that's e^{ - alpha² } e^{ - alpha^2 } = e^{-2 alpha²}.

So the inner product <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Therefore, the cross terms in rho would be cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ), all divided by N^2.

So putting it all together, rho is:

[ cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha|) ] / N^2.

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can compute the expectation values or the purity of rho.

Wait, the von Neumann entropy of rho is -Tr(rho ln rho). But since rho is a pure state, rho^2 = rho, so the von Neumann entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, rho is a projection operator, so its eigenvalues are 1 and 0, except for the state itself. So S(rho)=0.

Wait, but that would make del_b = 0 - S(tau). So if tau is a Gaussian state with some entropy, then del_b is negative of that. But the options don't include negative numbers, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the state is not pure. Wait, no, because |psi> is normalized, so rho is a pure state. So S(rho)=0.

So unless tau is a different kind of state. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a maximally mixed state, but that's not a Gaussian state necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the state |psi> as a mixed state, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in assuming rho is pure. Wait, no. Because |psi> is a normalized superposition, rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So S(rho)=0.

But then the problem must have del_b = 0 - S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is negative of the entropy of tau. But looking at the options, D is 0, which would imply S(tau)=0, but that would require tau to be a pure Gaussian state. So then del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But wait, the state is a non-Gaussian state. But the relative entropy measure here is the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian state's entropy. If both are zero, then the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that doesn't make sense. So I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct reference state. What's the reference Gaussian state? Maybe the problem is considering the reference state as the closest Gaussian state to rho, so that the relative entropy is minimal. Or perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments (like mean photon number and photon number variance) determine the state. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the one with the same first and second moments as rho.

In that case, tau would have the same first and second moments, but being Gaussian, and thus have a certain entropy. Then, the non-Gaussianity would be the difference between S(rho) and S(tau), which in this case, as rho is pure (S=0), and tau is a Gaussian state which may have non-zero entropy.

Wait, but if rho is pure, S(rho)=0. So if tau is a Gaussian state with, say, some entropy S_tau, then del_b would be 0 - S_tau = - S_tau. But the non-Gaussianity can't be negative, so perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the formula. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The problem says del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

Since rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau).

But Tr(tau ln tau) is the entropy of tau, S(tau). So del_b = - S(tau).

But if the non-Gaussianity is supposed to be a positive measure, perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value, so del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau).

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the non-Gaussianity should be a positive value indicating how non-Gaussian the state is.

So perhaps the formula is actually del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = -(S(tau)).

But the problem says del_b is defined as that. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this case, since rho is pure, S(rho||tau) = - Tr(rho ln tau).

But the problem's formula is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the opposite sign, so that del_b is the entropy difference in the other direction.

But regardless, perhaps I should compute the entropy of tau.

But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute it. So maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reference state is a coherent state. Let's say tau is a coherent state |beta>. Then, the density matrix tau would be |beta><beta|, a pure state with S(tau)=0. So del_b would be 0 - 0 =0, which would make the non-Gaussianity zero. But that's option D.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the given state is a non-Gaussian state. So perhaps the problem is not expecting that approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the state |psi> is a mixed state. But it's a pure state, as I thought earlier. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the normalization constant N. Let me recheck that.

Given phi = -pi/4, so 2phi = -pi/2. So sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. So exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 -0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Okay, correct.

Now, perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition, so the probability of being in |alpha> is cos^2(phi), but with N squared.

Wait, the probability of measuring |alpha> is |cos(phi)|^2 / N^2.

Because |psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So |a|^2 is |cos(phi)|^2 / N². Similarly for |b|^2 = |sin(phi)|^2 / N². Because N is a normalization factor, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, let's compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² = cos²(phi) / N².

Similarly, |b|² = sin²(phi) / N².

But N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}), which is sqrt(1 + (-1)*e^{-0.5}) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N² ≈ 0.3935.

So |a|² = (cos²(-pi/4)) / 0.3935.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, so cos² is 0.5. So |a|² = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈1.270.

But that's not possible because |a|² should be less than or equal to 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, because N² is the denominator. So if N² is 0.3935, then |a|² = 0.5 /0.3935 ≈1.27, which is greater than 1. That can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1. So that suggests I must have made a mistake in computing N.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for N. Let me re-express N.

N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}).

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, sin(2phi)=sin(-pi/2)=-1.

So N²=1 + (-1) e^{-2 (0.5)^2} = 1 - e^{-0.5} ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈0.3935.

So N² is approximately 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |a|² = cos²(phi) / N².

Wait, but wait. |a|² should be (cos phi)^2 / N².

Wait, but N is the normalization factor for the state vector. So |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N.

So the squared norm is [cos phi]^2 + [sin phi]^2 e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos phi sin phi e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha> .

Wait, no. Wait, no, because |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. So the correct normalization is:

N² = cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha>.

Wait, wait a minute. Earlier, I thought that <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}, because the inner product <alpha|beta> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2} e^{alpha beta^*}.

But alpha and -alpha are real numbers, so beta is -alpha.

So <alpha | -alpha> = e^{ - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 } e^{ alpha*(-alpha) } = e^{- alpha^2} e^{- alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So N² = cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha> ?

Wait, no. Wait, when you compute the norm squared of |psi>, you have to compute the inner product <psi|psi>:

<psi|psi> = [ cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] / N * [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ] / N.

Which expands to:

[ cos^2(phi) <alpha|alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) < -alpha | alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | -alpha> ] / N^2.

Now, <alpha|alpha> =1, < -alpha | -alpha> =1.

<alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha | alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So N² = [ cos^2(phi) *1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2(phi) * 1 ].

So N² = cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Wait, that's because the cross terms have e^{-2 alpha^2}, but the other terms are 1.

Wait, but that's only correct if I'm computing the inner product correctly. Because the state is |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Compute N²:

cos^2(phi) = cos^2(-pi/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.

sin^2(phi) = sin^2(-pi/4) = 0.5.

2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} = 2*(cos(-pi/4) sin(-pi/4)) e^{-0.5}.

cos(-pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2.

So their product is (-0.5), so 2 * (-0.5) e^{-0.5} = - e^{-0.5} ≈ -0.6065.

So N² = 0.5 + 0.5 + (-0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Which matches the earlier calculation. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

Thus, the probabilities |a|^2 = cos^2(phi) / N² = 0.5 /0.3935 ≈1.27. Wait, that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here. Because you can't have a probability greater than 1.

Wait, but wait, no. Because |a|^2 is the probability of the state being in |alpha>, but in this case, it's divided by N². Wait, no. Wait, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2 where a and b are the coefficients in the state |psi> = a |alpha> + b | -alpha>.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have a state expressed as (a |x> + b |y> ), the probabilities of measuring |x> and |y> are |a|^2 and |b|^2, provided that |x> and |y> are orthonormal. But |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal.

Therefore, the probabilities are not simply |a|^2 and |b|^2. So perhaps I should compute the correct probabilities.

The correct way to find the probabilities is to compute the density matrix rho and find its eigenvalues, which correspond to the probabilities of the state being in each eigenstate.

But rho is |psi><psi|, and since |psi> is a pure state, rho has rank 1, so it's a projection operator. The eigenvalues are 1 (with multiplicity 1) and 0 (with multiplicity N-1), where N is the dimension. But in this case, it's an infinite-dimensional space, so the density matrix is a pure state, with S(rho)=0.

But earlier, I thought that all Gaussian states are pure, but that's not the case. Wait, no. Coherent states are pure Gaussian states. But a superposition of two coherent states can be a pure state but non-Gaussian.

But in any case, I'm getting stuck because the problem's formula for non-Gaussianity seems to suggest that del_b is zero, but the options include D) 0, which would be the case if S(rho) and S(tau) are the same. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in fact using the relative entropy between the state and a specific Gaussian state, such as the completely mixed state. But then, the entropy of the completely mixed state in the limit would be maximum, which may not be applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero, and the reference Gaussian state is also a pure state (like a coherent state), so the entropy difference is zero. Hence, the non-Gaussianity is zero, which would be option D.

But that seems counterintuitive because the state is a superposition and thus non-Gaussian. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula. Let me think again: the relative entropy del_b is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). If tau is a Gaussian state with entropy S(tau), then del_b would be negative of that. But the options are all positive, so perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value. So del_b would be S(tau) -0.

But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute S(tau). So perhaps the problem is expecting us to realize that the state is a pure state, and thus the relative entropy difference is zero, leading to del_b=0, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? Because if tau is a reference Gaussian pure state, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of non-Gaussianity. Another approach is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, but the question is about relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state, but that's not the case because it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases.

Wait, wait. Wait, when phi is such that sin(2 phi) is zero, the state becomes a coherent state, which is Gaussian. But when phi is not zero, it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

But in this problem, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero, so the state is non-Gaussian.

But if the state is pure, del_b=0, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. For example, perhaps the reference state is the completely mixed state, but that's not Gaussian. Or perhaps the reference is the vacuum state, but that's Gaussian.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the given formula, but given that I can't compute the entropy of tau without knowing what it is, perhaps the answer is zero because the state is pure, and the reference Gaussian state is also pure, leading to del_b=0.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the state is a cat state, which is a non-Gaussian state, and the non-Gaussianity is non-zero, so option D can't be the answer.

But this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. But the state itself is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity must be non-zero. So the answer can't be D) 0. So options A, B, or C are possible.

But I'm not seeing a clear way forward. So perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given that the options include 0, but the state is non-Gaussian, I think the non-Gaussianity must be positive, so the answer is option C) 1.38.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a pure state and the reference Gaussian state is also a pure state. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer D)0 because the formula given in the question implies that, regardless of the state, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that's not correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or recall that the relative entropy between a pure state and a Gaussian state could be zero only if the state is Gaussian. But in this case, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But without further information, perhaps the intended answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.

The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]

where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]

where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Normalization**:  
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is calculated as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) (\(\sin(2\phi) = -1\)) and \(\alpha = 0.5\) (\(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\)), we find:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

2. **Density Matrix of the State**:  
   The density matrix \(\rho\) is given by:
   \[
   \rho = |\psi\rangle \langle\psi| = \frac{1}{N^2} \left[\cos^2(\phi)|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| + \sin^2(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha| + \cos(\phi)\sin(\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}(|\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha| + |-\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha|)\right].
   \]
   Since \(|\psi\rangle\) is a normalized superposition of coherent states, \(\rho\) represents a pure state. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).

3. **Reference Gaussian State**:  
   The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is not explicitly defined in the problem. However, Gaussian states (e.g., coherent or squeezed states) are typically pure, with \(S(\tau) = 0\). If \(\tau\) is a pure Gaussian state, then \(\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) = 0\).

4. **Relative Entropy Measure**:  
   Substituting \(S(\rho) = 0\) and \(S(\tau) = 0\) into the formula for \(\text{del}_b\), we find:
   \[
   \text{del}_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) = 0 - 0 = 0.
   \]

5. **Interpretation of Non-Gaussianity**:  
   The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of coherent states, making it non-Gaussian. However, the relative entropy measure as defined in the problem does not capture the non-Gaussianity in this case, as both \(\rho\) and \(\tau\) have zero entropy. This suggests that the problem's definition of non-Gaussianity leads to \(\text{del}_b = 0\), despite the state being non-Gaussian.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given formula and the analysis, the non-Gaussianity \(\text{del}_b\) is calculated to be zero. This result aligns with option D.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are more complex, like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Wait, so this is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, so their superposition should be non-Gaussian, especially for certain values of phi and alpha.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me write that down: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) e^{-2α²}).

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is a measure of how different two probability distributions are. In quantum terms, it's used here to compare the non-Gaussian state's entropy with that of a Gaussian state. The difference in entropies would give the non-Gaussianity.

So the task is to compute this del_b for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition, so rho = |psi><psi|. Let me compute that.

But before that, perhaps I should compute N. Let's plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha =0.5.

Compute sin(2phi): 2phi is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²): alpha is 0.5, so alpha² is 0.25. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2phi)* exp(...) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + that value). So 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Compute cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Cos is even, so cos(pi/4)=√2/2 ≈0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -√2/2 ≈-0.7071.

So the state becomes approximately [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Alternatively, factor out 0.7071: [ |0.5> - | -0.5> ] multiplied by 0.7071 /0.6275.

Wait, 0.7071 divided by 0.6275 is approx 1.127. So |psi> ≈ 1.127 (|0.5> - |-0.5>).

But maybe I don't need the exact state vector right now. Let me think about the non-Gaussianity measure. The measure is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau, the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but what is tau? The reference Gaussian state. Since the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a coherent state with the same displacement as the original, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a thermal state or something else.

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which one? Because the choice of tau can affect the calculation. But perhaps the problem is considering the reference state as the closest Gaussian state to the given state, so the minimal relative entropy. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps for a two-mode cat state, the reference Gaussian state is a squeezed vacuum or something else, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps for the relative entropy, the reference state is the state that minimizes Tr(rho ln tau), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the relative entropy is given as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Wait, no. The formula is Tr(rho ln rho) is the entropy S(rho), and similarly for tau. So del_b is the difference in the entropies.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the measure. Because relative entropy is usually a directed measure, meaning S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where the latter is Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau). Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me correct that.

The relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence) between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the formula given here is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit different. So it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau.

Wait, so del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). That's the measure they're using here. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in von Neumann entropies between the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state.

But wait, Gaussian states have certain entropy properties. For example, coherent states are pure, so their entropy is zero. Squeezed states are also pure, so their entropy is zero. But mixed Gaussian states, like thermal states, have non-zero entropy.

So if the given state is a non-Gaussian state (a cat state), then rho would be a mixed state, I believe. Because when you take a superposition of coherent states, the density matrix becomes a mixture of terms, leading to decoherence and thus mixedness. So S(rho) would be positive.

On the other hand, the reference Gaussian state tau would have some entropy S(tau). But what is tau? Maybe the reference is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for the relative entropy measure, tau is a specific Gaussian state, like the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the completely mixed state, but that might not make sense because Gaussian states can have varying entropies.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the reference Gaussian state tau is the most mixed Gaussian state possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific form of rho and then compute its von Neumann entropy.

So rho is |psi><psi|. Let me compute rho.

The state |psi> is a normalized state, so rho = |psi><psi|.

Given that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, and the state is a superposition of these, the density matrix rho would be:

rho = (|alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) | -alpha><-alpha| + sin(2phi) |alpha><-alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + cos(2phi) | -alpha><alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / N^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute rho as |psi><psi|.

Wait, the state is:

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So the density matrix is:

rho = ( |alpha><alpha| cos^2(phi) + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N^2.

Wait, because when you multiply [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] by its conjugate transpose, you get:

cos^2(phi)|alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|.

But because |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. But when you take |alpha><-alpha|, that's not diagonal in the number basis. How does that affect the density matrix?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the purity or the von Neumann entropy directly.

Wait, another approach: The von Neumann entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). But rho is a pure state if the state is a superposition, but wait, is |psi> a pure state?

Wait, no. Wait, because |psi> is normalized. So rho is a pure state, right? Because |psi> is a normalized vector, so rho = |psi><psi| is a pure state, and hence S(rho) = 0? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if |psi> is a pure state, then rho is pure, and hence S(rho) is zero. But wait, that can't be right, because the relative entropy measure would then be [0 - S(tau)].

Hmm, but wait, the problem is about non-Gaussianity. For a pure state, the entropy is zero. So if tau is a Gaussian pure state (like a coherent state), then S(tau) would also be zero. Thus, del_b would be zero, which would suggest the non-Gaussianity is zero, but that's not correct because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have misunderstood something.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a mixed state. No, wait, the state is a pure state because it's a normalized superposition of two coherent states. So rho has rank 1, and S(rho) is zero.

Wait, this is confusing. If rho is a pure state, then its entropy S(rho) is zero. But if tau is a Gaussian pure state, then its entropy is also zero. So del_b would be zero, which suggests the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is not necessarily pure. Maybe tau is a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the one that is closest to rho in some sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of rho. The given state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. But the reference state tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a thermal state or a squeezed state, but if it's a Gaussian pure state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b would be zero in that case.

But this can't be because the problem is asking for non-zero non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in fact considering the relative entropy in a different way. Wait, the formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. But for a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. If tau is a Gaussian pure state, Tr(tau ln tau) is also zero. So del_b would be zero. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the relative entropy measure here. Wait, maybe the formula is actually the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is Tr(rho ln (rho/tau)). Then, that would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the given formula is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

Wait, that's different. The given formula is not the standard relative entropy. The standard relative entropy is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). So the given del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), which is the difference in their entropies.

But if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, and if tau is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0.

But that can't be correct for this problem because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Therefore, perhaps tau is not a pure Gaussian state but a mixed Gaussian state. For example, if the reference Gaussian state is a completely mixed state, then S(tau) would be maximum, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to rho, such that tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me think about the structure of rho.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix rho would have terms like |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, and cross terms |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|.

In the Fock basis, the cross terms would involve terms like |n> <m|, where n and m are different. Because coherent states have Poissonian distributions, the off-diagonal terms would have elements that are not Gaussian.

Now, the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state would compare their entropies. But if rho is a pure state, perhaps tau is a different state. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem is looking for the non-Gaussianity in a different way. Perhaps the given state is not a pure state but a mixed state, but that can't be because |psi> is normalized.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the state is not a product state, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should compute N, rho, and then find the entropy of rho and some reference Gaussian state.

Given phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

Compute N as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}).

Compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N is approximately 0.6275.

Now, express rho.

rho = ( |alpha><alpha| cos^2(phi) + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N^2.

Wait, because when you expand |psi><psi|, each term's coefficient is [cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] multiplied by [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ], divided by N^2.

So the cross terms will have coefficients cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{- alpha^2} times the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>?

Wait, the inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2 - | - alpha |^2} ... wait, no. Wait, coherent states are defined as |alpha> = e^{-|alpha|²/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. So <alpha | beta> = e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{alpha* beta}.

So for <alpha | -alpha>, that would be e^{ - ( alpha² + (-alpha)^2 ) / 2 } e^{ alpha*(-alpha) }.

Since alpha is real (I think in this problem, alpha is a real number, because it's used as |-alpha>), so alpha is real. So alpha squared is alpha^2, same for (-alpha)^2. So the exponent is e^{ - (alpha² + alpha²)/2 } e^{ - alpha^2 }.

So that's e^{ - alpha² } e^{ - alpha^2 } = e^{-2 alpha²}.

So the inner product <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Therefore, the cross terms in rho would be cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ), all divided by N^2.

So putting it all together, rho is:

[ cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha|) ] / N^2.

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can compute the expectation values or the purity of rho.

Wait, the von Neumann entropy of rho is -Tr(rho ln rho). But since rho is a pure state, rho^2 = rho, so the von Neumann entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, rho is a projection operator, so its eigenvalues are 1 and 0, except for the state itself. So S(rho)=0.

Wait, but that would make del_b = 0 - S(tau). So if tau is a Gaussian state with some entropy, then del_b is negative of that. But the options don't include negative numbers, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the state is not pure. Wait, no, because |psi> is normalized, so rho is a pure state. So S(rho)=0.

So unless tau is a different kind of state. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a maximally mixed state, but that's not a Gaussian state necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the state |psi> as a mixed state, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in assuming rho is pure. Wait, no. Because |psi> is a normalized superposition, rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So S(rho)=0.

But then the problem must have del_b = 0 - S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is negative of the entropy of tau. But looking at the options, D is 0, which would imply S(tau)=0, but that would require tau to be a pure Gaussian state. So then del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But wait, the state is a non-Gaussian state. But the relative entropy measure here is the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian state's entropy. If both are zero, then the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that doesn't make sense. So I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct reference state. What's the reference Gaussian state? Maybe the problem is considering the reference state as the closest Gaussian state to rho, so that the relative entropy is minimal. Or perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments (like mean photon number and photon number variance) determine the state. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the one with the same first and second moments as rho.

In that case, tau would have the same first and second moments, but being Gaussian, and thus have a certain entropy. Then, the non-Gaussianity would be the difference between S(rho) and S(tau), which in this case, as rho is pure (S=0), and tau is a Gaussian state which may have non-zero entropy.

Wait, but if rho is pure, S(rho)=0. So if tau is a Gaussian state with, say, some entropy S_tau, then del_b would be 0 - S_tau = - S_tau. But the non-Gaussianity can't be negative, so perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the formula. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The problem says del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

Since rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau).

But Tr(tau ln tau) is the entropy of tau, S(tau). So del_b = - S(tau).

But if the non-Gaussianity is supposed to be a positive measure, perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value, so del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau).

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the non-Gaussianity should be a positive value indicating how non-Gaussian the state is.

So perhaps the formula is actually del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = -(S(tau)).

But the problem says del_b is defined as that. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this case, since rho is pure, S(rho||tau) = - Tr(rho ln tau).

But the problem's formula is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the opposite sign, so that del_b is the entropy difference in the other direction.

But regardless, perhaps I should compute the entropy of tau.

But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute it. So maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reference state is a coherent state. Let's say tau is a coherent state |beta>. Then, the density matrix tau would be |beta><beta|, a pure state with S(tau)=0. So del_b would be 0 - 0 =0, which would make the non-Gaussianity zero. But that's option D.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the given state is a non-Gaussian state. So perhaps the problem is not expecting that approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the state |psi> is a mixed state. But it's a pure state, as I thought earlier. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the normalization constant N. Let me recheck that.

Given phi = -pi/4, so 2phi = -pi/2. So sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. So exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 -0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Okay, correct.

Now, perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition, so the probability of being in |alpha> is cos^2(phi), but with N squared.

Wait, the probability of measuring |alpha> is |cos(phi)|^2 / N^2.

Because |psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So |a|^2 is |cos(phi)|^2 / N². Similarly for |b|^2 = |sin(phi)|^2 / N². Because N is a normalization factor, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, let's compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² = cos²(phi) / N².

Similarly, |b|² = sin²(phi) / N².

But N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}), which is sqrt(1 + (-1)*e^{-0.5}) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N² ≈ 0.3935.

So |a|² = (cos²(-pi/4)) / 0.3935.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, so cos² is 0.5. So |a|² = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈1.270.

But that's not possible because |a|² should be less than or equal to 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, because N² is the denominator. So if N² is 0.3935, then |a|² = 0.5 /0.3935 ≈1.27, which is greater than 1. That can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1. So that suggests I must have made a mistake in computing N.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for N. Let me re-express N.

N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}).

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, sin(2phi)=sin(-pi/2)=-1.

So N²=1 + (-1) e^{-2 (0.5)^2} = 1 - e^{-0.5} ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈0.3935.

So N² is approximately 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |a|² = cos²(phi) / N².

Wait, but wait. |a|² should be (cos phi)^2 / N².

Wait, but N is the normalization factor for the state vector. So |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N.

So the squared norm is [cos phi]^2 + [sin phi]^2 e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos phi sin phi e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha> .

Wait, no. Wait, no, because |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. So the correct normalization is:

N² = cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha>.

Wait, wait a minute. Earlier, I thought that <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}, because the inner product <alpha|beta> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2} e^{alpha beta^*}.

But alpha and -alpha are real numbers, so beta is -alpha.

So <alpha | -alpha> = e^{ - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 } e^{ alpha*(-alpha) } = e^{- alpha^2} e^{- alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So N² = cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) e^{-4 alpha^2} + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} <alpha| -alpha> ?

Wait, no. Wait, when you compute the norm squared of |psi>, you have to compute the inner product <psi|psi>:

<psi|psi> = [ cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] / N * [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ] / N.

Which expands to:

[ cos^2(phi) <alpha|alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) < -alpha | alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | -alpha> ] / N^2.

Now, <alpha|alpha> =1, < -alpha | -alpha> =1.

<alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha | alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So N² = [ cos^2(phi) *1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2(phi) * 1 ].

So N² = cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Wait, that's because the cross terms have e^{-2 alpha^2}, but the other terms are 1.

Wait, but that's only correct if I'm computing the inner product correctly. Because the state is |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Compute N²:

cos^2(phi) = cos^2(-pi/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.

sin^2(phi) = sin^2(-pi/4) = 0.5.

2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} = 2*(cos(-pi/4) sin(-pi/4)) e^{-0.5}.

cos(-pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2.

So their product is (-0.5), so 2 * (-0.5) e^{-0.5} = - e^{-0.5} ≈ -0.6065.

So N² = 0.5 + 0.5 + (-0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Which matches the earlier calculation. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

Thus, the probabilities |a|^2 = cos^2(phi) / N² = 0.5 /0.3935 ≈1.27. Wait, that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here. Because you can't have a probability greater than 1.

Wait, but wait, no. Because |a|^2 is the probability of the state being in |alpha>, but in this case, it's divided by N². Wait, no. Wait, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2 where a and b are the coefficients in the state |psi> = a |alpha> + b | -alpha>.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have a state expressed as (a |x> + b |y> ), the probabilities of measuring |x> and |y> are |a|^2 and |b|^2, provided that |x> and |y> are orthonormal. But |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal.

Therefore, the probabilities are not simply |a|^2 and |b|^2. So perhaps I should compute the correct probabilities.

The correct way to find the probabilities is to compute the density matrix rho and find its eigenvalues, which correspond to the probabilities of the state being in each eigenstate.

But rho is |psi><psi|, and since |psi> is a pure state, rho has rank 1, so it's a projection operator. The eigenvalues are 1 (with multiplicity 1) and 0 (with multiplicity N-1), where N is the dimension. But in this case, it's an infinite-dimensional space, so the density matrix is a pure state, with S(rho)=0.

But earlier, I thought that all Gaussian states are pure, but that's not the case. Wait, no. Coherent states are pure Gaussian states. But a superposition of two coherent states can be a pure state but non-Gaussian.

But in any case, I'm getting stuck because the problem's formula for non-Gaussianity seems to suggest that del_b is zero, but the options include D) 0, which would be the case if S(rho) and S(tau) are the same. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in fact using the relative entropy between the state and a specific Gaussian state, such as the completely mixed state. But then, the entropy of the completely mixed state in the limit would be maximum, which may not be applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero, and the reference Gaussian state is also a pure state (like a coherent state), so the entropy difference is zero. Hence, the non-Gaussianity is zero, which would be option D.

But that seems counterintuitive because the state is a superposition and thus non-Gaussian. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula. Let me think again: the relative entropy del_b is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). If tau is a Gaussian state with entropy S(tau), then del_b would be negative of that. But the options are all positive, so perhaps the problem is taking the absolute value. So del_b would be S(tau) -0.

But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute S(tau). So perhaps the problem is expecting us to realize that the state is a pure state, and thus the relative entropy difference is zero, leading to del_b=0, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? Because if tau is a reference Gaussian pure state, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of non-Gaussianity. Another approach is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, but the question is about relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state, but that's not the case because it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases.

Wait, wait. Wait, when phi is such that sin(2 phi) is zero, the state becomes a coherent state, which is Gaussian. But when phi is not zero, it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

But in this problem, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero, so the state is non-Gaussian.

But if the state is pure, del_b=0, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. For example, perhaps the reference state is the completely mixed state, but that's not Gaussian. Or perhaps the reference is the vacuum state, but that's Gaussian.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the given formula, but given that I can't compute the entropy of tau without knowing what it is, perhaps the answer is zero because the state is pure, and the reference Gaussian state is also pure, leading to del_b=0.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the state is a cat state, which is a non-Gaussian state, and the non-Gaussianity is non-zero, so option D can't be the answer.

But this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. But the state itself is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity must be non-zero. So the answer can't be D) 0. So options A, B, or C are possible.

But I'm not seeing a clear way forward. So perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given that the options include 0, but the state is non-Gaussian, I think the non-Gaussianity must be positive, so the answer is option C) 1.38.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a pure state and the reference Gaussian state is also a pure state. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer D)0 because the formula given in the question implies that, regardless of the state, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that's not correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or recall that the relative entropy between a pure state and a Gaussian state could be zero only if the state is Gaussian. But in this case, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But without further information, perhaps the intended answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]

where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]

where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Normalization**:  
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is calculated as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) (\(\sin(2\phi) = -1\)) and \(\alpha = 0.5\) (\(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\)), we find:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

2. **Density Matrix of the State**:  
   The density matrix \(\rho\) is given by:
   \[
   \rho = |\psi\rangle \langle\psi| = \frac{1}{N^2} \left[\cos^2(\phi)|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| + \sin^2(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha| + \cos(\phi)\sin(\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}(|\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha| + |-\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha|)\right].
   \]
   Since \(|\psi\rangle\) is a normalized superposition of coherent states, \(\rho\) represents a pure state. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).

3. **Reference Gaussian State**:  
   The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is not explicitly defined in the problem. However, Gaussian states (e.g., coherent or squeezed states) are typically pure, with \(S(\tau) = 0\). If \(\tau\) is a pure Gaussian state, then \(\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) = 0\).

4. **Relative Entropy Measure**:  
   Substituting \(S(\rho) = 0\) and \(S(\tau) = 0\) into the formula for \(\text{del}_b\), we find:
   \[
   \text{del}_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) = 0 - 0 = 0.
   \]

5. **Interpretation of Non-Gaussianity**:  
   The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of coherent states, making it non-Gaussian. However, the relative entropy measure as defined in the problem does not capture the non-Gaussianity in this case, as both \(\rho\) and \(\tau\) have zero entropy. This suggests that the problem's definition of non-Gaussianity leads to \(\text{del}_b = 0\), despite the state being non-Gaussian.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given formula and the analysis, the non-Gaussianity \(\text{del}_b\) is calculated to be zero. This result aligns with option D.
