Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. So, you apply a regularization method to make these infinities manageable, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. The idea is to make the calculations finite and then remove the regularization by taking a limit, like letting the cutoff go to infinity or returning to four dimensions.

But some theories might not need regularization because they're already finite, meaning their calculations don't produce these problematic infinities. So the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization ever.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? In classical theories, I don't think regularization is a thing because they don't have the same divergences as quantum theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have loop diagrams or renormalization issues. So classical theories probably don't need regularization because they don't have the divergences that quantum theories do. So maybe option D is the correct answer.

But wait, I should think about the others just to be sure.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory, and I remember that it does require renormalization. Because when you calculate things like the electron's charge or mass, you get these loop corrections that lead to divergences. So you need to regularize these, maybe using a cutoff or something like that. So QED does require regularization, so option C is not the answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with the strong force, and I think it's a non-Abelian gauge theory. It does require regularization because of similar divergences, especially due to the running coupling. The theory is also asymptotically free, but that doesn't change the fact that you need to regularize loop integrals. So QCD would require regularization. So option B isn't the answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. String theory aims to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. I think in string theory, the perturbative expansion is a sum over different topologies of the string worldsheet, leading to loop diagrams. But because strings have a length scale (the string length), which is a natural cutoff, maybe string theories don't require the same kind of regularization. Or perhaps they handle divergences in a different way because the fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require traditional regularization because the stringy nature introduces a natural scale that prevents the same types of infinities. Or wait, I'm not so sure. Do string theories still have renormalization issues? I think they do, but perhaps they're handled differently, maybe through background field methods or other techniques. Alternatively, maybe some string theories are finite, but I'm not certain. So I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, going back, the question is which theory never requires regularization. So which of these don't have any divergences that need regularization.

In classical theories, like option D, there are no infinities from quantum loops because they're not part of the theory. So regularization isn't needed. Therefore, D should be the correct answer.

So the options are: the question is about theories that never require regularization. So the answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on whether regularization is necessary. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences—infinites that arise in calculations. The question asks for a theory that does not require regularization, meaning it does not produce such divergences.

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring theory is a quantum theory that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics. While it deals with loop diagrams and divergences, its fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles, and it introduces a natural scale (the string length). This unique structure may reduce or eliminate the need for traditional regularization. However, it is not entirely clear if superstring theory completely avoids regularization, as some divergences may still require special handling.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is a quantum field theory describing the strong interaction. It involves non-Abelian gauge fields and loop corrections, which lead to divergences. Regularization is necessary in QCD to manage these infinities, making it a theory that requires regularization.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is a quantum field theory describing the electromagnetic interaction. It also involves loop corrections and divergences, such as in the calculation of the electron's charge and mass. Regularization is required in QED to handle these issues, so it is not the correct answer.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory based on Maxwell's equations. It does not involve quantum loops or divergences, and therefore does not require regularization. This makes it the correct answer.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only classical electrodynamics does not require regularization at high energies because it is a classical theory without the divergences that necessitate regularization in quantum field theories.
