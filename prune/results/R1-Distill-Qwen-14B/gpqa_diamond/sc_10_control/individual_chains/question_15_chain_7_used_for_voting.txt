Okay, so I've got this question about transit detection probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think it's something to do with the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But since both planets are already detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, maybe that gives us some info about their orbits.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass of the planet, but it doesn't tell us the inclination of the orbit directly. Oh, but wait, the RV method is more sensitive to planets with higher velocities, which depends on the mass and the inclination. So maybe the RV's detection tells us something about their orbital planes?

But in this question, the focus is on the transit probability. I think the transit probability formula is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star's orbit or something. Wait, no, the probability is given by the formula P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but wait, no, I think for Earth-like planets, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so that term is negligible. So the main factor is R_star over a_planet.

Wait, no, I think the probability is more accurately given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is the area of the star as seen from Earth, divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, so the chance is proportional to the star's apparent size relative to the planet's orbit. So the formula is roughly (R_star / a_planet)^2. But wait, wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else... Or perhaps it's (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet? Or is it (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + sin i), but wait, no, the RV method gives information based on the velocity, which relates to the sine of the inclination. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet is closer to the star because a_planet is smaller. So that would make (R_star / a_planet) larger. So a planet with a smaller orbital period (since period is shorter) would be closer to the star. Because from Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G(M+m) P^2)/(4π²), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M is the star's mass. So a is proportional to (P^(2/3)) * (M_star)^(1/3). So for Planet_1, which has a period three times shorter than Planet_2, its a is smaller than Planet_2's.

Wait, let me think. Let's say M1 is the mass of Planet_1's star, which is twice that of Planet_2's star, M2 = M, so M1 = 2M.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 / 3.

Using Kepler's third law: a^3 = [G(M + m) P^2]/(4π²). Since m is much smaller than M, a^3 ∝ (M * P^2). So for Planet_1, a1^3 = (2M) * (P1^2) = 2M * (P2/3)^2.

For Planet_2, a2^3 = M * P2^2.

So a1^3 = (2M) * (P2^2 /9) ) = (2/9) M P2².

a2^3 = M P2².

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Hmm, what's (2/9)^(1/3)? 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is around 0.6, maybe 0.6 something. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than Planet_2's. So R_star is same for both because the host stars have same radii. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can ignore it.

So P1_transit = R_star / a1.

P2_transit = R_star / a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.6 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666... So P1 is 1.666 times higher than P2, so approximately 1.65 times higher.

So Planet_1 has higher probability. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times. That's probably from a wrong calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the orbital periods and the a calculation.

Given P1 = P2/3.

So a1^3 = (2 M) (P1^2) / (something), but in the Kepler law, the exact proportionality is a^3 ∝ M * P^2.

So a1^3 = 2M * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M P2² /9.

a2^3 = M P2².

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Which is a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)).

Wait, 9^(1/3) is cube root of 9, which is about 2.08.

2^(1/3) is about 1.26.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 is about 0.605 a2.

So when I take a2/a1, it's 1 /0.605 ≈1.653. So about 1.65 times. So P1's probability is 1.65 times higher than P2's.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking again at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, with ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct choice.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius, the key factor is the semi-major axis of the planets' orbits.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1, the host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

1. **Calculate \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \):**
   - For Planet_1: \( a_1^3 \propto 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9} \).
   - For Planet_2: \( a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \).

   Taking the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}}{M_2P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \).

   Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \):
   - \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \), \( 9^{1/3} \approx 2.08 \), so \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.605 \).
   - Therefore, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \).

2. **Compare transit probabilities:**
   The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
   \]
   Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \):
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.605 \cdot a_2} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.653.
   \]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Using Kepler's third law: a^3 = [G(M + m) P^2]/(4π²). Since m is much smaller than M, a^3 ∝ (M * P^2). So for Planet_1, a1^3 = (2M) * (P1^2) = 2M * (P2/3)^2.

For Planet_2, a2^3 = M * P2^2.

So a1^3 = (2M) * (P2^2 /9) ) = (2/9) M P2².

a2^3 = M P2².

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Hmm, what's (2/9)^(1/3)? 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is around 0.6, maybe 0.6 something. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So P1_transit = R_star / a1.

P2_transit = R_star / a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.6 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666... So P1 is 1.666 times higher than P2, so approximately 1.65 times higher.

So Planet_1 has higher probability. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Which is a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)).

2^(1/3) is about 1.26.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 is about 0.605 a2.

So when I take a2/a1, it's 1 /0.605 ≈1.653. So about 1.65 times. So P1's probability is 1.65 times higher than P2's.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should observe Planet_1.

The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1, the host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

1. **Calculate \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \):**
   - For Planet_1: \( a_1^3 \propto 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9} \).
   - For Planet_2: \( a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \).

   Taking the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}}{M_2P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \).

   Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \):
   - \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \), \( 9^{1/3} \approx 2.08 \), so \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.605 \).
   - Therefore, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \).

2. **Compare transit probabilities:**
   The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
   \]
   Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \):
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.605 \cdot a_2} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.653.
   \]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
