Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillates, so it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction at theta=30 degrees and what f looks like.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the power depends on the polarization and the direction. Oh right, the dipole radiation comes into play here. For a dipole oscillating in the z-direction, the radiation pattern is maximum along the z-axis (theta=0) and depends on theta.

The power radiated per unit solid angle is given by the radiation formula. I think the formula for the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is something like ( (dipole moment)^2 ) / (some constants) multiplied by (1/(lambda^4)) or something like that. Oh wait, I recall that the power is proportional to the square of the angular frequency and the square of the dipole moment, and inversely proportional to the fifth power of the wavelength? Or wait, maybe it's the fourth power. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the general expression for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is ( ( (e^2) (omega^4) (sin^2 theta) ) / (6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ) ) multiplied by something. So the power per unit solid angle (like, the intensity) would have a dependence on sin^2(theta) or something like that.

Wait, but the exact formula for the power per unit solid angle in the far field (radiation zone) for a dipole is ( ( (p0^2) sin^2(theta) ) / (something * c^3) ) ) multiplied by omega^4. Since p0 is the amplitude of the dipole moment, and omega is the angular frequency. And since lambda = 2 pi c / omega, omega is proportional to 1/lambda. So omega^4 would be (1/lambda)^4. So the power per unit solid angle (f) would have a dependence of lambda^-4 multiplied by sin^2(theta), perhaps?

So the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) and lambda^-4. So looking at the options, let's see. Option A has lambda^-4, but other options have different exponents.

But wait, the maximum power A is the maximum value of f multiplied by the solid angle element in the radiation zone. The maximum occurs when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees, wait no, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum when theta is 90 degrees? Or is it when theta is 0?

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern is maximum along the axis where the dipole is oriented. Wait, no, I think the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole direction. Oh, wait, no, that's for a magnetic dipole. For an electric dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, meaning theta = 90 degrees. So at theta=0, the radiation could be zero or maximum? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the electric dipole radiation in the far field has a radiation pattern that's maximum at theta=90 degrees, and falls off with theta. Because the radiation is due to the changing dipole moment, and the far field depends on the sin(theta) squared term. So the maximum occurs when sin(theta) is maximum, which is theta=90 degrees. So for the intensity (f), which is the power per unit solid angle, the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, not at theta=0. So when theta is 90, sin(theta)=1, so that's when f is maximum.

So if the question is asking about theta=30 degrees, which is 30 degrees from the z-axis, so within the first octant, but not the plane. So sin(theta) would be 0.5. So the fraction of the maximum power would be (sin(theta))^2 divided by the maximum, which is (sin(90 degrees))^2 = 1. So (0.5)^2=0.25, so 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to (sin(theta))^2 times lambda^-4.

Looking back at the options, let me check. The question asks for the fraction of A (the maximum) that is radiated at theta=30 degrees. So the fraction is 1/4, right? Because (sin(theta))^2 is 0.25. So the fraction is 25% of the maximum.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4. Option B is 1/4 and lambda^-3. So I think the function f is proportional to sin^2(theta) and lambda^-4. So the function would have the form f proportional to (sin(theta))^2 / lambda^4.

Wait, but let me think again about the dependence on lambda. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (omega^4) times sin^2(theta), and since omega is 2pi c / lambda, omega^4 is (2 pi c / lambda)^4 = (c^4)/(lambda^4) * (2pi)^4. So the f would have a 1/lambda^4 term, multiplied by sin^2(theta). So yes, f is proportional to sin^2(theta) * lambda^-4.

So the function f would have the form of f(theta) ~ sin^2(theta)/lambda^4. So among the options, looking for the fraction and the form.

So the fraction is 1/4 (since sin(30)=0.5, squared is 0.25), and the form is lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4. Option C is "C) 1/4, lambda^(-4)". So that would be the correct option.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've heard that some radiation patterns have a different angular dependence. Maybe I'm confusing with the magnetic dipole. For an electric dipole, the radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta), but for a magnetic dipole, I think it's the same. So no, no confusion there; the function is the same.

So the fraction is 1/4, and f is proportional to lambda^-4 and sin^2(theta). So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The charge distribution radiates at a wavelength \(\lambda\), and the power radiated per unit solid angle in the radiation zone is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is \(A\), and the goal is to determine the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For an oscillating electric dipole, the power radiated per unit solid angle in the far field is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\) and inversely proportional to \(\lambda^4\). This is derived from the radiation formula for a dipole, where the angular dependence arises from the \(\sin^2(\theta)\) term, and the wavelength dependence comes from \(\omega^4\), with \(\omega \propto 1/\lambda\). Thus, the function \(f\) has the form:

\[
f \propto \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\lambda^4}.
\]

The maximum power \(A\) occurs when \(\sin^2(\theta)\) is maximized, which happens at \(\theta = 90^\circ\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\). Therefore, the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = 0.25 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

From the options provided, the fraction is \(1/4\), and the function \(f\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches option C.

The maximum power \(A\) occurs when \(\sin^2(\theta)\) is maximized, which happens at \(\theta = 90^\circ\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\). Therefore, the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = 0.25 = \frac{1}{4}.

From the options provided, the fraction is \(1/4\), and the function \(f\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches option C.
