Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with partial differential equations, especially heat equations, we often use numerical methods like finite differences to approximate the solutions. But this question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, which I think involves some kind of splitting or decomposition.

The question mentions matrix exponential functions being approximated by a fractional approximation. Matrix exponentials come up in the context of solving systems of linear differential equations, right? Like when you have a system that can be written as du/dt = Au, the solution is u(t) = e^(At)u0. So, if we're using finite differences, maybe the matrix A is from the discretized version of the PDE.

When moving to a parallel algorithm, I think about how to split the problem so that different parts can be computed concurrently. One approach might be to partition the domain or the equations in a way that allows each part to be solved independently and then combined. Another thought is about the structure of the matrix A—if it can be decomposed into smaller matrices, maybe each part can be exponentiated in parallel.

The key factor here is what makes the sequential approach turn into a parallel one. The options given are about stability analysis, nonlocal boundary conditions, complex roots, and linear partial fractions.

Stability analysis (Option A) is important in ensuring that the numerical method doesn't blow up or produce nonsensical results. But I'm not sure how directly it's involved in converting an algorithm to be parallel. It's more about the accuracy and reliability of the method, not the parallelization per se.

Option B is about nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions can complicate the solution, requiring more involved methods. But how does that tie into parallel splitting? Maybe certain types of boundary conditions allow for easier decomposition, but I'm not certain. I'm not recalling a direct link between nonlocal boundaries and parallel algorithms.

Option C is complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like those used in exponential splitting, perhaps rely on the properties of the roots of certain polynomials. If the approximation uses a rational function with complex roots, that might affect the stability or the splitting. Wait, matrix exponential splitting often uses techniques like the Padé approximation, which is a rational function. The roots of the denominator could influence whether the approximation can be split into parallel components. For example, if the approximation's denominator factors into terms that can be handled separately, each part can be computed in parallel. So complex roots might indicate that the approximation can't be easily split, but perhaps if they have certain properties, it allows for decomposition.

Option D is linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to decompose complex rational functions into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be broken down into a sum of simpler terms, each of which can be exponentiated and computed separately, then this would enable parallel processing. So if the fractional approximation allows for a linear partial fraction decomposition, that would be the key for parallel splitting. That makes sense because each term in the partial fraction can be handled in parallel.

Thinking about how matrix exponentials are computed, methods like the exponential splitting use approximations like the Padé method. If the approximation can be written as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices or scalar multiples, each part can be computed independently. For example, if the approximation is e^{At} ≈ sum (c_i e^{a_i t}), each e^{a_i t} can be computed in parallel. So the ability to split the approximation into such terms would be crucial.

So what's the key factor? The question says the key factor is converting sequential to parallel, which relies on whether the approximation can be decomposed. So if the fractional approximation allows for a linear partial fraction decomposition, that's the key. Therefore, option D would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I also thought about complex roots. If the approximation's denominator has complex roots, that might affect whether it can be split. But I'm not as confident about that. Alternatively, linear partial fractions directly relate to how the function is split. So I think D is the right choice.

When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting, the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one hinges on the ability to decompose the problem into independent components that can be computed concurrently. The matrix exponential function, often approximated by fractional methods like Padé approximations, plays a central role in this context. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (Stability analysis):** While stability is crucial for ensuring the numerical method's reliability, it does not directly address the conversion to a parallel algorithm. Stability analysis is more about ensuring accuracy and preventing nonsensical results, not about enabling parallel computation.

- **Option B (Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions):** Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate the solution process, but they are not inherently linked to the parallelization of the algorithm. Their presence might influence the numerical method but does not directly facilitate parallel splitting.

- **Option C (Complex roots of fractional approximation):** The roots of the denominator in a fractional approximation can influence the stability and accuracy of the approximation. However, the key factor for parallelization is not the nature of these roots but rather how the approximation can be decomposed for parallel computation.

- **Option D (Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation):** Linear partial fraction decomposition is a method to break down complex rational functions into simpler terms. If the fractional approximation of the matrix exponential can be decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions, each term can be exponentiated and computed independently in parallel. This decomposition is the critical factor enabling parallel splitting, as it allows the problem to be divided into concurrent tasks.

Given that the ability to decompose the fractional approximation into linear partial fractions is the key enabler of parallel computation, the correct answer is:
