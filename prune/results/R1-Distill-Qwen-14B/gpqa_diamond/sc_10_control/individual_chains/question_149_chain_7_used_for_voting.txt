Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question says that a small peptidic compound was synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each peak is integrating to about half a proton, maybe? And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm.

Wait, if the two peaks are from the same proton, but they're split into two, what else could cause that? Maybe something about the environment of that proton changing. Oh, because in an NMR, if a proton is split into multiple peaks, it's usually due to coupling with neighboring protons. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not coupling to adjacent protons.

Another thought: could it be that the molecule has some kind of symmetry or that the proton is experiencing different environments in different parts of the molecule? Or perhaps the molecule is in a dynamic process, like some kind of equilibrium. Wait, but if it's dynamic, the peaks might broaden or average out, not split into two distinct peaks. So maybe not.

Looking at the LC-MS data: the crude compound has two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass but different something else? Because same mass would mean same molecular weight. Oh, but same mass but different retention times. So two different compounds with the same mass. Wait, same mass and same mass spectrum. So same molecular formula, same mass. So it's either constitutional isomers or stereoisomers.

If it were constitutional isomers, the NMR would have different shifts for protons because the structures are different. But the NMR shows the same expected shifts except for this one proton. So that suggests it's not constitutional isomers. So it's probably a case of stereoisomers.

Now, the options: Option A says the compound is contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the LC-MS would have a peak with a lower mass (the precursor) and the main product. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected, so A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for direction of rotation and how they interact with chiral environments. So in NMR, if the molecule is chiral and has a chiral center, the alpha proton might be split into different environments. Wait, but enantiomers are mirror images. So in an achiral environment (like in NMR without chiral shift reagents), the NMR spectrum would be the same for both enantiomers. So you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Unless the molecule has some internal asymmetry. Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a singlet for any symmetric protons, but if the proton is chiral and attached to a stereocenter, maybe the environment would cause splitting. Hmm, but in a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers are present, and each would have the same NMR spectrum because the environment is the same, so the peaks would merge, not split into two. So I'm not sure about B. Maybe not the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure what that means. Double coupling sounds like maybe a scenario where a proton couples with two different sets of neighboring protons. But if that's the case, you'd see more splitting, not two peaks. Alternatively, could it be that during the reaction, two different coupling partners cause the same proton to split into two doublets? Wait, but the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, same shift but two peaks. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, in this case, the NMR shows that except for these two peaks, everything else looks expected. So the same alpha-proton is appearing as two peaks. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, then each isomer would have a different environment for that proton, leading to different shifts. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe not diastereomers either?

Wait, but the question states that the two peaks have similar chemical shifts and same integral together as 1H. So each is about 0.5H. If it's from the same proton, then maybe it's an example of a so-called "AB system" where two protons are coupled to each other, but in this case, it's the same proton. Or perhaps an internal standard or something else.

Wait, another possibility: is it due to exchange processes, like in a tautomerism or something where the proton environment changes rapidly on the NMR timescale, causing a peak that's a doublet? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the crude compound contains a diastereomer, which can cause the same shift if the environments are identical except for one part, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the two peaks in the NMR are from the same proton but split into two. So maybe the compound has two different diastereomers, each with a slightly different environment for that proton. But the shifts are similar, so maybe the diastereomers are close in structure, causing the same alpha proton to have similar shifts but split into two. But then, for diastereomers, the integration would be for each isomer. Wait, the integrals add up to 1H, which suggests that each peak is 0.5H. So maybe each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? But that doesn’t quite make sense because each diastereomer would have a whole proton. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture. But as I thought earlier, the NMR would not show two separate peaks for the same proton. So that's probably not it.

Wait, going back to the options. Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Amide bonds can sometimes form with different coupling partners. Could double coupling lead to each proton coupling to two different sets of protons, leading to a doublet of doublets? But in the question, the two peaks are for the same alpha proton, so perhaps there's something else.

Wait, another possibility: the crude compound has a byproduct from the synthesis. For example, during the amide formation, maybe a side product forms with an extra group, but that would have a different mass, which the LC-MS would show as a different peak. But the question says the two peaks have same mass, so that's not it.

Hmm, maybe the issue is with the NMR itself. Could it be an artifact? But the question says the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule, except for these two peaks. So probably not an instrument error.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each with a different configuration at a chiral center, then the alpha-proton would have a slightly different environment in each isomer. So the same proton in each diastereomer would have a slightly different chemical shift. But since they are in a 1:1 ratio, maybe you'd see two peaks. But the shifts would be similar because the environments are not too different. Also, the integrals would add up to 1H because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each molecule would have one alpha proton. So if you have 50% of each diastereomer, each would contribute their own set of peaks. So the integral would add up to 1H. That could fit.

But wait, diastereomers have different properties, so their NMR shifts would differ. But the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule is a diastereomeric mixture, each would have a different shift for that proton. So the two peaks would have different shifts, but in the question, the shifts are similar. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, could it be that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, leading to the same proton being split into two due to coupling within the molecule? Like perhaps a vicinal coupling between two identical protons? But that would cause a doublet. Hmm, but the initial problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. So the two peaks aren't from coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture, but with the presence of a chiral shift reagent. In that case, the enantiomers would have different shifts, and you'd see two separate peaks. But I think without a shift reagent, the NMR of a racemic mixture would show a single set of peaks because the two enantiomers are identical in the NMR environment. So the peaks would merge, not split into two. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has an internal double bond or some other feature that allows for different configurations, leading to diastereomers. But again, the NMR shifts would differ more than described.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight, same retention time? No, same mass but different retention times. Because same mass and same intensity. So they must be two different structures with same molecular formula. So constitutional isomers maybe, but then the NMR would be different. Or stereoisomers.

If it's stereoisomers (like diastereomers), then their NMRs would differ in shift. So the same alpha proton would have a different shift in each isomer, leading to two peaks. But the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts. So perhaps that's possible if the diastereomers are very similar, like epimers at a single stereocenter, which could cause a small shift.

Wait, but then the question mentions that the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule except for two peaks. So if it's a diastereomeric mixture, perhaps one of the diastereomers is the desired product and the other is a byproduct with a similar structure, leading to similar shifts but not identical. Thus, the same alpha-proton appears as two peaks with similar shifts.

But why would the integrals add up to 1H? If the mixture is 50:50, each would contribute 0.5H. Since each molecule has one proton, each isomer contributes 0.5H each, so total is 1H. That makes sense.

But why would the LC-MS show two peaks of the same mass? Because each peak is a different diastereomer, but same molecular formula. So same mass, but different structures. So same mass, but different retention times because they have different physical properties.

So this would fit with option D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but option B is about enantiomers. Would enantiomers have same retention times on LC? Because enantiomers are not separated by normal LC columns unless a chiral stationary phase is used. So if the LC was run under normal conditions, the two enantiomers would co-elute, giving a single peak. But the question says two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity. So that suggests that the LC is separating them, which would require a chiral column. But the question doesn't mention that. Hmm, so if the LC was using a chiral column, the enantiomers would split into two peaks. But the mass spec would show same mass. So that's another possibility.

But the question is about the NMR as well. If it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would have a single peak for each proton, unless a chiral shift reagent is present, which the question doesn't mention. So if they have a racemic mixture, the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So maybe it's not B.

So if the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass, that suggests stereoisomers. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So considering that, the most likely explanation is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but another thought: if the crude compound hasn't been purified and the impurity is a diastereomer, then the diastereomer would have the same molecular formula but a different structure, leading to a different NMR. So in the NMR, the alpha proton in the diastereomer would have a different shift, but similar because it's only a small structural change. So the two peaks would be for the same proton in each diastereomer. Thus, the NMR would have two peaks for that proton, each integrating to 0.5H. Then the LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass, different retention times.

So that points to option D.

The question involves analyzing a crude peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, suggesting two compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Contamination with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a lower molecular mass than the expected product. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and, in the absence of a chiral shift reagent, would produce identical NMR spectra. This would not result in two distinct peaks for the same proton. Additionally, LC-MS typically does not separate enantiomers unless a chiral column is used, which is not mentioned here. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation**  
   Double coupling refers to a proton coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. However, this would typically result in a more complex splitting pattern (e.g., a doublet of doublets) rather than two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts. This explanation does not fit the observations.

4. **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers with different physical properties, including NMR shifts. If the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the alpha-proton in each isomer would experience slightly different environments, leading to two peaks with similar chemical shifts. The integrals of these peaks would add up to 1H if the mixture is approximately 50:50. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula but different structures.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS data.

Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to think it through step by step.
