Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given from A to D.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Typically, it's around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but the exact value can vary based on the reaction. Also, the enthalpy change is usually calculated per mole of H+ or OH- ions reacting.

First, I think I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, releasing heat.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives 1 H+ ion.
Molarity is moles per liter. So HCl is 0.2 M in 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So moles H+ from HCl is 0.1.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
But wait, in the first dissociation, it's complete, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is not completely dissociated. Oh wait, but in dilute solutions, it's often approximated as completely dissociated for neutralization purposes, especially in such problems. So I think for this problem, each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions.
So the moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Thus, H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Now the Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-.
The solution is 0.5 M in 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from acids and OH- from base will react. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but H+ is more than OH- here. So the OH- will neutralize part of the H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. HCl gives 0.1 H+; H2SO4 gives 0.18 H+ (because 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+). So total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until one is exhausted. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here.

So moles of H+ that react: 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). The remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ neutralized. So the heat released depends on the moles of H+ that react with OH-.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of heat. Let's recall that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) when strong acid and strong base are used.

But wait, in this problem, the acids and base are of different strengths. HCl is strong, H2SO4 is strong in first dissociation but the second is weak. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can treat all H+ as available, but perhaps not.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is completely dissociated, but the second may not be. So in 0.3 M H2SO4, the first H+ is 0.3 M, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles, leading to 0.09 H+ from first dissociation. The second H+ (as HSO4^-) may not fully dissociate. So perhaps in this case, only 0.09 * 1 (from H2SO4) is available for neutralization, and the second H+ isn't considered unless it's a strong acid. Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to treat H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per molecule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate based on all H+ available, regardless of dissociation. Let me proceed with the initial calculation, then see if any options match.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.1
H+ from H2SO4: 0.18
Total H+ = 0.28
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. So the amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So, we have 0.2 moles of OH- reacting with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2, OH- is 0.2.

The heat released would be based on the moles of H+ (or OH-) that react.

But wait, what's the enthalpy change per mole in this scenario? Because the reactants are HCl (strong acid), H2SO4 (strong acid, but maybe only first H+ is considered strong?), and Ba(OH)2 (strong base).

Wait, the standard molar enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol. But when mixing different acids and bases, maybe we have to compute each reaction separately and sum them up.

Wait, perhaps each H+ neutralization contributes -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * (-57) kJ.

Wait, but wait, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and only the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second isn't. So perhaps only 0.09 moles of H+ from H2SO4 is considered for neutralization?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, so for H2SO4, 2 H+ per mole.

Hmm, let me think again.

When H2SO4 is a strong acid, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- in the first step. But wait, actually, the first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-) is only about 100% for the first H+ (since H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the second H+ comes from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is weak, around 1% dissociation). So in practice, the first H+ is fully available, and the second is not.

So for H2SO4, with 0.3 M in 0.3 L, moles of H2SO4 is 0.09. So moles of H+ from first dissociation is 0.09 * 1 = 0.09. The second H+ is negligible for a 0.3 M solution, so only 0.09 H+ can be considered as available for neutralization.

Wait, but this complicates things. So in our case, H+ comes from HCl (0.1), H2SO4 (0.09), and any other sources? No, because the base is Ba(OH)2, which provides OH-.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I considered H2SO4 as contributing 0.18 H+ (0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18). But if only the first H+ is available, then it's 0.09.

So maybe I should re-calculate the H+ as:

HCl: 0.1
H2SO4: 0.09 (only first H+)
Total H+ available for neutralization: 0.19.

But wait, is that the case?

Wait, the initial problem statement doesn't specify the extent of H2SO4's dissociation, so perhaps we should take all H+ into account as if they are available. This is a common assumption in textbook problems unless stated otherwise.

So let me proceed with the initial calculation where H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+.

So, H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

They neutralize each other up to the OH- amount, so 0.2 H+ reacts, producing 0.2 H2O.

The heat released is 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 × (1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ) → wait no, wait.

Wait wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, I was considering the enthalpy in kJ, but the options have kcal and kJ.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

So if the neutralization is 0.2 moles, and each mole releases 57 kJ, then 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ × (1 kcal/4.184 kJ) ≈ -2.72 kcal. Because 11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But the enthalpy is negative because it's exothermic. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

The neutralization releases heat. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ released, which is exothermic, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, another point: the problem mixes three solutions. But wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 mol reaction → 0.2 × (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is much higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is considering the neutralization of both H+ and OH- as a single reaction, but perhaps the H2SO4 contributes two H+ but only one is neutralized.

Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting factor here. So the OH- (0.2) will neutralize 0.2 H+, regardless of their source.

Wait, but let me think again: in the reaction, each mole of H+ (from any source) reacts with OH- to form water, each such reaction releases 57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ is the heat released. Now, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) = -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ from the acid, but considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid which may not fully dissociate, so perhaps only the first H+ is considered. So in that case, H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles of H+.

So total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19, and OH- is 0.2. So H+ is the limiting factor here, because we need 0.19 moles of OH- to neutralize all H+. But OH- is 0.2, which is more than 0.19. So all H+ (0.19) would react, and 0.01 moles of OH- would remain.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.19, which would release 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → approximately 10.83 kJ. Converting to kcal: 10.83 / 4.184 ≈ 2.587 kcal. So the enthalpy would be approximately -2.59 kcal, which is not exactly among the options. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But why is there this discrepancy? It's because in the first approach, I considered both H+ from H2SO4 (assumed fully dissociated), leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-; in this approach, only 0.19 H+ reacts.

But the problem might not consider the second H+ from H2SO4 as available for neutralization, so the total H+ is 0.19. Then, OH- is 0.2, so H+ is the limiting factor, and all 0.19 H+ would react, leaving 0.01 OH-.

In that case, the enthalpy change is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → 10.83 kJ is 10.83 × (1 kcal/4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.587 kcal → approximately -2.59 kcal, but the options don't have this. The next option is A) -2.72 kcal, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, including the second from H2SO4. So in that case, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, so 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2×57=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ. That's way larger. How?

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the enthalpy per mole being 57 kJ is wrong. Maybe the problem uses a different value, such as 25 kJ per mole or so, but that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction also involves the neutralization of the sulfate ions or something else, but I don't think that's the case. Neutralization is just H+ + OH- → H2O.

Alternatively, maybe I got the moles wrong. Let me recheck:

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol H2SO4. If each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ is 0.1 +0.18=0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ and OH- will neutralize in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH- react, producing 0.2 moles H2O.

So the heat released is 0.2 ×57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Let me calculate that: 11.4 kJ × (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy would be approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but considering the entire mixing. So, the total heat released is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. So the option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -2.72 kcal in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options have both units. Let's see the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

So, 11.4 kJ is not among the options as a kJ value, but option D is -16 kJ.

So why the discrepancy? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, maybe the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole, but considering all the H+ from all acids. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers Ba(OH)2 as a diprotic base, but that's not the case. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives two OH-, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 gives 2 H+ but only 1 is neutralized because the second is weak. So maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09, not 0.18.

So total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is 0.19, OH- 0.2 → H+ is limiting. So all 0.19 H+ reacts, OH- left is 0.01.

Heat released is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → 10.83 kJ, which is about 2.587 kcal, but this isn't an option exactly.

Hmm, the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, regardless of dissociation, leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. Converting to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal → so -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. That would be if 0.28 H+ reacts, but that's more than the available OH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the initial moles. Let me sum up the H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+ (if fully dissociated) or 0.09 H+ (if only first H+ is considered).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So if H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+:

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- = 0.2.

So H+ is in excess. Neutralization of 0.2 H+ → 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → option A's value in kcal.

If H2SO4 contributes 0.09 H+:

H+ = 0.19; OH- = 0.2 → neutralization of 0.19 H+ → 10.83 kJ → ≈2.587 kcal. Not matching any options except option A is close but not exact.

But the options don't have 2.58 kcal. The closest is option A: -2.72.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options have some in kJ and some in kcal. So option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, 16 kJ would be if 0.28 H+ reacts, but that's more than the available OH- (0.2). So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4, but the neutralization isn't limited by OH-.

Wait, no. Because OH- is 0.2, which can only neutralize 0.2 H+.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the H+ from H2SO4 is only 0.09, so the total H+ is 0.19. Then, OH- is 0.2, which is more than 0.19. So all H+ is neutralized, and some OH- remains.

So heat released is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → about -2.587 kcal, which would round to -2.6 kcal, but that's not an option. The closest option is A) -2.72.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all three solutions are being mixed, and the total volume affects the molarity, but that's not relevant for the moles calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me redo the moles:

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mole → H+ = 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M = 0.09 mole → 2 H+ → 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M = 0.1 mole → 2 OH- → 0.2.

So total H+ = 0.28; OH- = 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 H+ neutralized → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

Convert to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726 → approx 2.73 kcal → -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal; that's very close.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each molecule of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 \( \text{H}^+ \) ions, so moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each molecule of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 \( \text{OH}^- \) ions, so moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which releases heat.  
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), which neutralizes \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

3. **Heat released:**
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

4. **Match with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) directly converted to kcal, but this is inconsistent with the enthalpy per mole.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is much larger and does not match the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given from A to D.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Typically, it's around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but the exact value can vary based on the reaction. Also, the enthalpy change is usually calculated per mole of H+ or OH- ions reacting.

First, I think I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, releasing heat.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives 1 H+ ion.
Molarity is moles per liter. So HCl is 0.2 M in 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So moles H+ from HCl is 0.1.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
But wait, in the first dissociation, it's complete, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is not completely dissociated. Oh wait, but in dilute solutions, it's often approximated as completely dissociated for neutralization purposes, especially in such problems. So I think for this problem, each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions.
So the moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Thus, H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Now the Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-.
The solution is 0.5 M in 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from acids and OH- from base will react. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but H+ is more than OH- here. So the OH- will neutralize part of the H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. HCl gives 0.1 H+; H2SO4 gives 0.18 H+ (because 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+). So total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until one is exhausted. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here.

So moles of H+ that react: 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). The remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ neutralized. So the heat released depends on the moles of H+ that react with OH-.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of heat. Let's recall that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) when strong acid and strong base are used.

But wait, in this problem, the acids and base are of different strengths. HCl is strong, H2SO4 is strong in first dissociation but the second is weak. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can treat all H+ as available, but perhaps not.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is completely dissociated, but the second may not be. So in 0.3 M H2SO4, the first H+ is 0.3 M, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles, leading to 0.09 H+ from first dissociation. The second H+ (as HSO4^-) may not fully dissociate. So perhaps in this case, only 0.09 * 1 (from H2SO4) is available for neutralization, and the second H+ isn't considered unless it's a strong acid. Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to treat H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per molecule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate based on all H+ available, regardless of dissociation. Let me proceed with the initial calculation, then see if any options match.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.1
H+ from H2SO4: 0.18
Total H+ = 0.28
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. So the amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So, we have 0.2 moles of OH- reacting with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2, OH- is 0.2.

The heat released would be based on the moles of H+ (or OH-) that react.

But wait, what's the enthalpy change per mole in this scenario? Because the reactants are HCl (strong acid), H2SO4 (strong acid, but maybe only first H+ is considered strong?), and Ba(OH)2 (strong base).

Wait, the standard molar enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol. But when mixing different acids and bases, maybe we have to compute each reaction separately and sum them up.

Wait, perhaps each H+ neutralization contributes -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * (-57) kJ.

Wait, but wait, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and only the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second isn't. So perhaps only 0.09 moles of H+ from H2SO4 is considered for neutralization?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, so for H2SO4, 2 H+ per mole.

Hmm, let me think again.

When H2SO4 is a strong acid, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- in the first step. But wait, actually, the first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-) is only about 100% for the first H+ (since H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the second H+ comes from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is weak, around 1% dissociation). So in practice, the first H+ is fully available, and the second is not.

So for H2SO4, with 0.3 M in 0.3 L, moles of H2SO4 is 0.09. So moles of H+ from first dissociation is 0.09 * 1 = 0.09. The second H+ is negligible for a 0.3 M solution, so only 0.09 H+ can be considered as available for neutralization.

Wait, but this complicates things. So in our case, H+ comes from HCl (0.1), H2SO4 (0.09), and any other sources? No, because the base is Ba(OH)2, which provides OH-.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I considered H2SO4 as contributing 0.18 H+ (0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18). But if only the first H+ is available, then it's 0.09.

So maybe I should re-calculate the H+ as:

HCl: 0.1
H2SO4: 0.09 (only first H+)
Total H+ available for neutralization: 0.19.

But wait, is that the case?

Wait, the initial problem statement doesn't specify the extent of H2SO4's dissociation, so perhaps we should take all H+ into account as if they are available. This is a common assumption in textbook problems unless stated otherwise.

So let me proceed with the initial calculation where H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+.

So, H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

They neutralize each other up to the OH- amount, so 0.2 H+ reacts, producing 0.2 H2O.

The heat released is 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 × (1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ) → wait no, wait.

Wait wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, I was considering the enthalpy in kJ, but the options have kcal and kJ.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

So if the neutralization is 0.2 moles, and each mole releases 57 kJ, then 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ × (1 kcal/4.184 kJ) ≈ -2.72 kcal. Because 11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But the enthalpy is negative because it's exothermic. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

The neutralization releases heat. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ released, which is exothermic, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, another point: the problem mixes three solutions. But wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 mol reaction → 0.2 × (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is much higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is considering the neutralization of both H+ and OH- as a single reaction, but perhaps the H2SO4 contributes two H+ but only one is neutralized.

Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting factor here. So the OH- (0.2) will neutralize 0.2 H+, regardless of their source.

Wait, but let me think again: in the reaction, each mole of H+ (from any source) reacts with OH- to form water, each such reaction releases 57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ is the heat released. Now, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) = -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ from the acid, but considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid which may not fully dissociate, so perhaps only the first H+ is considered. So in that case, H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles of H+.

So total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19, and OH- is 0.2. So H+ is the limiting factor here, because we need 0.19 moles of OH- to neutralize all H+. But OH- is 0.2, which is more than 0.19. So all H+ (0.19) would react, and 0.01 moles of OH- would remain.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.19, which would release 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → approximately 10.83 kJ. Converting to kcal: 10.83 / 4.184 ≈ 2.587 kcal. So the enthalpy would be approximately -2.59 kcal, which is not exactly among the options. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But why is there this discrepancy? It's because in the first approach, I considered both H+ from H2SO4 (assumed fully dissociated), leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-; in this approach, only 0.19 H+ reacts.

But the problem might not consider the second H+ from H2SO4 as available for neutralization, so the total H+ is 0.19. Then, OH- is 0.2, so H+ is the limiting factor, and all 0.19 H+ would react, leaving 0.01 OH-.

In that case, the enthalpy change is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → 10.83 kJ is 10.83 × (1 kcal/4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.587 kcal → approximately -2.59 kcal, but the options don't have this. The next option is A) -2.72 kcal, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, including the second from H2SO4. So in that case, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, so 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2×57=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ. That's way larger. How?

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the enthalpy per mole being 57 kJ is wrong. Maybe the problem uses a different value, such as 25 kJ per mole or so, but that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction also involves the neutralization of the sulfate ions or something else, but I don't think that's the case. Neutralization is just H+ + OH- → H2O.

Alternatively, maybe I got the moles wrong. Let me recheck:

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol H2SO4. If each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ is 0.1 +0.18=0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ and OH- will neutralize in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH- react, producing 0.2 moles H2O.

So the heat released is 0.2 ×57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Let me calculate that: 11.4 kJ × (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy would be approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but considering the entire mixing. So, the total heat released is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. So the option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -2.72 kcal in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options have both units. Let's see the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

So, 11.4 kJ is not among the options as a kJ value, but option D is -16 kJ.

So why the discrepancy? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, maybe the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole, but considering all the H+ from all acids. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers Ba(OH)2 as a diprotic base, but that's not the case. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives two OH-, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 gives 2 H+ but only 1 is neutralized because the second is weak. So maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09, not 0.18.

So total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is 0.19, OH- 0.2 → H+ is limiting. So all 0.19 H+ reacts, OH- left is 0.01.

Heat released is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → 10.83 kJ, which is about 2.587 kcal, but this isn't an option exactly.

Hmm, the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to treat all H+ as available, regardless of dissociation, leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. Converting to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal → so -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. That would be if 0.28 H+ reacts, but that's more than the available OH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the initial moles. Let me sum up the H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+ (if fully dissociated) or 0.09 H+ (if only first H+ is considered).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So if H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+:

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- = 0.2.

So H+ is in excess. Neutralization of 0.2 H+ → 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → option A's value in kcal.

If H2SO4 contributes 0.09 H+:

H+ = 0.19; OH- = 0.2 → neutralization of 0.19 H+ → 10.83 kJ → ≈2.587 kcal. Not matching any options except option A is close but not exact.

But the options don't have 2.58 kcal. The closest is option A: -2.72.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options have some in kJ and some in kcal. So option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, 16 kJ would be if 0.28 H+ reacts, but that's more than the available OH- (0.2). So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4, but the neutralization isn't limited by OH-.

Wait, no. Because OH- is 0.2, which can only neutralize 0.2 H+.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the H+ from H2SO4 is only 0.09, so the total H+ is 0.19. Then, OH- is 0.2, which is more than 0.19. So all H+ is neutralized, and some OH- remains.

So heat released is 0.19 ×57 = 10.83 kJ → about -2.587 kcal, which would round to -2.6 kcal, but that's not an option. The closest option is A) -2.72.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all three solutions are being mixed, and the total volume affects the molarity, but that's not relevant for the moles calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me redo the moles:

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mole → H+ = 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M = 0.09 mole → 2 H+ → 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M = 0.1 mole → 2 OH- → 0.2.

So total H+ = 0.28; OH- = 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 H+ neutralized → 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

Convert to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726 → approx 2.73 kcal → -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal; that's very close.

So the answer should be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each molecule of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 \( \text{H}^+ \) ions, so moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each molecule of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 \( \text{OH}^- \) ions, so moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which releases heat.  
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), which neutralizes \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

3. **Heat released:**
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

4. **Match with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) directly converted to kcal, but this is inconsistent with the enthalpy per mole.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is much larger and does not match the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
