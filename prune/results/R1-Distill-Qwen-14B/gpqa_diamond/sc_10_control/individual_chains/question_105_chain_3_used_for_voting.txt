Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is about how this situation can mimic an exoplanet's effect, and what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm. So the main point is comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots. The problem wants to know the exoplanet radius relative to the star's radius so that the dip in brightness (the signal) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait. The question states that to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So if the star wasn't spotted, what would cause the same brightness variation? An exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So we're comparing the brightness drop from the planet to the brightness drop from the spots.

So first, I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let's break it down. The star's brightness (or luminosity) comes from its surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the total brightness is a bit less. But because only one hemisphere is spotted, the amount of spots that are visible depends on the star's rotation.

Wait, no. The problem says that when the star is observed, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum and minimum brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots are moving, but the star's overall brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas. So the observed brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area that we see as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere. So when we view the star, we see part of the spotted hemisphere and part not. So the brightness will vary depending on how much of the spotted area is facing us.

Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star. So if the star's rotation axis is such that only one hemisphere is spotted, then as it rotates, the amount of the spotted area in our view changes. So when the spot is at the edge, we see a part, and when it's facing us, we see the full extent. But I'm not sure if the star's rotation is such that the spots are entirely in view or moving in and out.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) )? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the hemisphere's area is (4π R² / 2) = 2 π R². Wait, no. A hemisphere's surface area is half of the total surface area of a sphere, which is 4π R². So each hemisphere is 2π R². But the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the full spots, so the dip in brightness would be the area of the spots times the temperature difference, I think.

Wait, no. The star's brightness is determined by the sum of the emission from all its surface. Each small patch of the star emits according to its temperature. So the total flux (brightness) is the sum of fluxes from each part.

The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. So the total flux from the star when part of it is cooler (spots) is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

So the star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R^2). But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the flux lost due to the spots. 

Wait, no. The total flux when spots are present is the sum of the normal flux minus the spots' contribution. Let me think again. 

The total flux when spots are present is [ (Area without spots) * F_unspotted + (Area with spots) * F_spotted ].

Because F_unspotted is σ T_eff^4, and F_spotted is σ (T_eff - 1000 K)^4? Wait, no. The problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Does that mean T_spot = T_eff - 1000? Or is it a temperature difference of 1000 K, perhaps in the opposite direction? Hmm, the problem states "temperature difference of 1000 K," but it's unclear which way. But since the spots are dark, they're cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K, I suppose.

Wait, wait. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So the flux from each spot is σ*(5000)^4, and the flux from the rest of the star is σ*(6000)^4.

The total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us is F = (Area_unspotted * σ 6000^4) + (Area_spotted * σ 5000^4).

But when the spots are on the other side, the flux is F0 = 4π R^2 * σ 6000^4.

The variation in flux is the change when the star rotates, bringing the spots into view. But wait, the star is rotating, but only one hemisphere is spotted. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. When it's not, the flux is at its maximum.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spot coverage is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 π R^2) ) = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 - (0.4 π R²) * (σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)).

Wait, no, because the spots are at a lower temperature. So the flux from the spots is less than the surrounding. So the total flux is (F0) minus the (difference in flux per unit area) multiplied by the area of the spots.

The difference in flux per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4) * σ.

Wait, but when the star's not spotted, the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (Area_spotted) * (σ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ).

So the change in flux, ΔF, is the difference between F0 and F, which is (Area_spotted) * (σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The flux without spots is F0 = (4 π R^2) * σ 6000^4.

With spots, the flux is F = (4 π R^2 - Area_spotted) * σ 6000^4 + Area_spotted * σ 5000^4.

So the flux variation when the spots are visible is (F - F0) = - Area_spotted * σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

The maximum dip in brightness is when the spotted area is fully visible. So the maximum dip is ΔF = F0 - F = Area_spotted * σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

Wait, but the flux would be lower when the spots are visible, so the variation would be a decrease of ΔF.

The relative change is ΔF / F0, which is the fractional dip. 

So the fractional dip (δ) is [ (Area_spotted) * (6000^4 -5000^4) ) / (4 π R^2 * 6000^4) ) ].

Simplify this:

δ = (Area_spotted) * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 π R^2 * 6000^4 )

We can factor 6000^4 as 6^4 * 10^12 (since 6000 is 6e3, so 6^4 is 1296, 10^3^4 is 1e12) but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical values.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625)*1e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Now, the Area_spotted is 0.4 π R^2.

So δ = (0.4 π R²) * (6.71e14) / (4 π R² * 1.296e15 )

Simplify this: The R² and π cancel out.

δ = (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Compute numerator: 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

So δ = (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 ) ≈ 0.0517.

So about 5.17% dip.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the photometric time-series is showing variation due to the spots, which can mimic an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the dip due to the planet would need to match this 5.17% dip.

Now, what's the dip caused by an exoplanet? When a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2, so the ratio is (R_p / R_s)^2.

So we set this ratio equal to the dip we calculated, which is 0.0517.

So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.0517.

Take square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but wait. The dip from the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2, which is 0.0517, so R_p is about 0.227 times R_s. But none of the options are around 0.227. Let's check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, 0.227 isn't among them. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check calculations.

Wait, in the spot calculation, I assumed that when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the dip is maximum. But perhaps that's not correct. Because the star is a sphere, and when we view the star, the area of the hemisphere that is visible is 2 pi R², as before.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. The area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the visible portion of the spotted hemisphere varies. Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, so the spots are not visible, and the star's flux is at maximum.

Wait, but for a star, when you have a hemisphere covered in spots, the maximum dip occurs when the hemisphere is facing us. So the dip is as computed.

Wait, but wait, when a planet transits, it covers a circular area. So the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. So the dip from the planet is when the planet is in front, covering a circular area. So if the dip from the planet is the same as the dip from the spots, then R_p is sqrt(δ) times R_s.

Wait, in our calculation δ is 0.0517, so sqrt(0.0517) is approximately 0.227, which is about 0.23 R_s. But none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute the dip calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate in and out of view, so the maximum dip isn't when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, but perhaps when only part is visible. No, because the maximum dip would occur when the maximum area of the spots is visible. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum would be when that hemisphere is fully visible, so the dip is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere has spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. So the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2. So spots' area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. That part seems correct.

Then, the flux change when the spots are visible is (0.4 pi R^2) * (sigma) * (6000^4 -5000^4).

Wait, but the star's total flux without spots is sigma * 6000^4 * 4 pi R^2. So the dip is (0.4 pi R²) * (6000^4 -5000^4) * sigma divided by (4 pi R² sigma 6000^4).

Simplify: The dip delta is (0.4 pi R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4)) / (4 pi R^2 6000^4 ) ) * sigma/sigma cancels. So numerator: 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4), denominator:4 *6000^4.

Wait, so delta = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 *6000^4 ].

Wait, 0.4 /4 is 0.1.

So delta = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4 )

Hmm, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e15, 5e3^4 is 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 =1.296e15 -6.25e14= 6.71e14.

So delta = 0.1 * 6.71e14 /1.296e15.

Compute 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = approximately 0.517.

So delta = 0.1 *0.517 = 0.0517, which is about 5.17% dip. So that part is correct.

So the dip from the spots is 5.17%, and the dip from the planet must be the same. So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the star's brightness is affected by both the spots and the unspotted areas, but perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness over time, not the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct area. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. The spotted area in one hemisphere is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. So when the spotted hemisphere is viewed, the area of spots is 0.4 pi R^2.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2 ) * 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 *5000^4 ] * sigma.

Wait, no, because 4 pi R^2 is the entire area. Hmm, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots; when it's not, we don't. So the maximum dip is when the hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but the star's total flux without any spots would be when no spots are present. But when spots are present, the flux is lower. So when the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is not visible (like when it's on the far side), the flux is at its maximum (F0). When the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us, the flux is at its minimum (F_min).

The dip is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = [(F0 - F_min)]/F0.

Wait, F0 is the flux without any spots, which is sigma 6000^4 * 4 pi R².

F_min is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, so F_min = [ (4 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma 6000^4 ] + [0.4 pi R² * sigma 5000^4 ].

So F_min = (3.6 pi R²) * sigma 6000^4 + (0.4 pi R²) sigma 5000^4.

So the dip is (F0 - F_min)/F0.

F0 =4 pi R² sigma 6000^4.

So F0 - F_min = 4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - [3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ]

= (4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 -3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4) - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

So dip = [0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 ].

Again, the same as before: 0.4/(4) = 0.1.

delta = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Which gives delta ≈0.0517, as before.

So the dip is about 5.17%. So the planet's dip needs to be the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rp/Rstar≈0.227.

But the options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, none of these are near 0.227. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star is being observed in a way that the spots are not completely visible, perhaps because the star's rotation makes the spots only partially visible, leading to a smaller dip. Or perhaps the maximum dip is when only a portion of the spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered with spots, so when it's viewed from Earth, the entire hemisphere is in view when the star is at a certain position. So the maximum dip is when that hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area of the spots. Let's double-check. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 pi R^2. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip differently. Because the star is being observed from Earth, and when the star rotates, only part of the spots comes into view. Wait, no. The problem states that the star's one hemisphere is entirely covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, all spots are visible. So the dip is maximum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (6000^4 -5000^4). Let me recompute that.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = (5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 =6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14. Correct.

So 6.71e14 divided by 6000^4 (1.296e15) is approximately 0.517.

So 0.1 * 0.517 is 0.0517. So the dip is 5.17%.

Wait, perhaps the planet's dip is 5.17%, so R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0517)= approx 0.227.

But none of the options are near 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dip caused by the spots is in the opposite direction. Or perhaps the problem is considering when the spots are not covering the entire hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on a hemisphere, but as the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip, but only when the spots are on the limb. No, that doesn't make sense. The maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the total variation, not the maximum dip. Wait, the problem says that the observed brightness variation is periodic, which suggests that the spots are on the surface and as the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view. But the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view with a certain phase. However, the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal-like curve, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. Or perhaps the amplitude is the peak dip. So the dip amplitude is 5.17%, which would be the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, but perhaps I got the calculation right and the options are wrong, which is unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation isn't just the dip when the spots are present, but the modulation as the spots rotate. So perhaps the variation is more complex, perhaps considering the phase curve or the rotational modulation. But I think the problem is simplifying it to the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a planet that's causing a dip of the same amplitude, but perhaps the planet's transit doesn't block the same amount of light as the spots. Wait, but the problem states that the star isn't covered by spots, so the dip is solely due to the planet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux from the star when the spots are present, but perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to not be fully visible, leading to a lower dip. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on a hemisphere, but the star's rotation means that only a fraction of the spots is visible at any time. But that doesn't seem right because the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty", implying that when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the light curve's variation over time, which would involve integrating the change as the star rotates. But that might complicate things, and the problem doesn't specify that. So I think the earlier approach is correct.

So with the dip being 5.17%, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0517) times the star's radius, which is approximately 0.227 R_star. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Let me think: the star's radius is R, so area is 4 pi R^2. A hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. No, the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots on a single face, but when the star rotates, the spots rotate into view and out of view, so the maximum area visible at any time is a certain percentage.

Wait, no, when the hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible. So the dip is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the flux is calculated. Let me think again. The flux is the sum of the flux from all areas. The unspotted parts emit at T=6000K, and the spotted parts at T=5000K.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma 6000^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma 5000^4).

Area_unspotted = 4 pi R^2 - Area_spotted.

But wait, the spotted area is 0.4 pi R^2. So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the Area_unspotted is (4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2) = 3.6 pi R^2.

Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R^2 is visible. The other hemisphere is unspotted, so 2 pi R^2 is unspotted.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the Area_unspotted is 2 pi R^2 (the other hemisphere) plus the unspotted part of the current hemisphere.

Wait, no, the hemisphere is either spotted or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R^2 is visible as spots, and the remaining 1.6 pi R^2 is unspotted. So the total unspotted area is 2 pi R^2 (other hemisphere) + (2 pi R^2 -0.4 pi R^2) (unspotted part of current hemisphere) = 2 pi R^2 + 1.6 pi R^2 =3.6 pi R^2.

So when the spots are fully visible, the flux is:

F = (3.6 pi R^2 * sigma 6000^4) + (0.4 pi R^2 * sigma 5000^4).

So the dip is (F0 - F)/F0, where F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4.

So F0 - F = 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 - [3.6 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4 ]

= (0.4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4) - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

So dip delta = [0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 ].

Same as before: 0.4/(4) = 0.1, so 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 =0.1 * 0.517 =0.0517.

So the dip is 5.17% as before.

So, the planet's R_p must satisfy (R_p / R_star)^2 =0.0517 → R_p = 0.227 R_star.

But the options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the spot filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. But the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere and the planet's dip is when the planet covers part of the star. But the planet can cover any part, including the spots, which might change the dip. But the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots", so the planet's dip would be based on the star's full emission.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way: the dip due to the planet is the same as the dip due to the spots. So R_p^2/R_star^2 = 0.0517 → R_p/R_star =sqrt(0.0517)=0.227.

But options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the delta. Let me recalculate.

Wait, computing 6000^4 and 5000^4 accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 =1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4=1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 -0.625) *1e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So (6000^4 -5000^4) =6.71e14.

Then delta = 0.1 * 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = 0.1 * (6.71 /12.96) ≈ 0.1 *0.517=0.0517.

So delta is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than that. So T_spot =6000-1000=5000 K. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the entire star changes, but no, because the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots' rotation, not the overall temperature.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the change in the star's brightness as a function of rotation, and the amplitude of this change is what's being compared to the planet's transit. But how?

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't a simple dip, but a periodic modulation, which could have a certain amplitude. For example, the star's brightness varies as the spots come into view, and the amplitude could be the peak-to-peak variation, which might involve twice the dip. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the maximum dip is 5.17%, and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, which is 100% of the star's light. So the peak-to-peak variation would be 5.17% (from F0 to F_min), but that's the same as the dip. So the amplitude is 5.17%.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of the same amplitude. So back to R_p/R_s=0.227.

No option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the light curve's variation as a fraction of the star's brightness, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. Let me try that.

If the spot area is 20% of the entire star's surface (4 pi R^2), then the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2 =0.8 pi R^2.

Then, delta = [0.8 pi R^2 * (6000^4-5000^4)] / [4 pi R^2 *6000^4 ].

So 0.8/(4) = 0.2.

delta =0.2 * (6.71e14 /1.296e15) =0.2 *0.517=0.1034, about 10.34% dip.

Then, the planet's R_p would be sqrt(0.1034) ≈0.321 R_s. So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So perhaps I misread the problem and the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) )=0.4 pi R^2.

But if I instead consider that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2=0.8 pi R^2.

But the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the spots are 20% of the hemisphere. So perhaps I should stick with the initial approach.

Wait, but if I get delta=0.0517, and none of the options match, but if I recalculate with the spot area being 0.8 pi R^2, I get delta=0.1034, which is option D (0.32 R).

So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2 )=0.4 pi R^2.

But perhaps when the star rotates, the spots are only visible for a certain fraction of the time, leading to an average dip. But that wouldn't make sense because the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, not the average.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to both the spots and the unspotted areas as the star rotates, leading to a sinusoidal variation whose amplitude equals the maximum dip we calculated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the star's rotation, which would involve integrating the change as the spots rotate into view, but that seems more complex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the effective area covered by the spots as seen from Earth. Since the star is a sphere, when a spot is on the limb, it's only a small part of the area that's visible. Wait, but when the entire hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible.

Hmm.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the areas again. Let me think.

The dip is 5.17%, so the planet's area blocked is 5.17% of the star's area.

So the planet's area is 0.0517 * (4 pi R^2) = (R_p^2 / R^2 ) *4 pi R^2 → R_p^2 =0.0517 *4 pi R^2 /4 pi → R_p^2=0.0517 R^2. So R_p=0.227 R.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the planet's transit causing a dip in flux, but the star's flux is higher due to the spots. No, because the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", so the star's flux is the same as a normal star, so the dip would be due to the planet.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots cause a variation in brightness, and the planet's transit would also cause a variation of the same amplitude. So perhaps the amplitude is the same, but the dip is different.

Wait, but the dip is the amplitude, so that shouldn't change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux, not the absolute dip. But I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's brightness as a function of time. When the star is unspotted, the brightness is F0. When the spots are visible, it's F_min = F0 - delta_F.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is delta_F.

The planet's transit would cause a variation of (R_p/R_star)^2 * F0. So to match the amplitude, (R_p/R_star)^2 = delta_F/F0.

But delta_F is 0.0517 F0, so (R_p/R_star)^2=0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_star.

Still, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the star's rotation as a sinusoidal function, and the amplitude is half the maximum dip. So the amplitude would be delta_F/2.

But that would make the amplitude 2.585%, so R_p= sqrt(0.02585)=0.160 R_star. Still, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots and the planet, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, but considering that the spot area is 0.4 pi R^2, and the dip is 0.0517. So the planet's area is 0.0517 of the star's area.

Star's area is 4 pi R^2.

So planet's area is 0.0517 *4 pi R^2 = 0.2068 pi R^2.

Planet's area is pi R_p^2 =0.2068 pi R^2 → R_p^2=0.2068 R^2 → R_p= sqrt(0.2068) R ≈0.4546 R. But that's larger than any of the options, and option A is 0.39, which is close but not exact.

No, that can't be right because the dip from the planet would be R_p^2/R^2, which is 0.2068, so 20.68% dip, which is much larger than our calculated 5.17%.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the spots as a function of the star's rotation period, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots as a function of their position on the star's surface, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. So the maximum dip is 5.17%, and the maximum increase is when the spots are on the far side, so the flux is 100% of F0. So the peak-to-peak variation is 5.17% of F0. So the amplitude is 5.17% of F0, same as the dip.

So the planet's transit dip would have to be 5.17% of F0, leading to R_p=0.227 R.

No matching option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the calculation is done in terms of luminosity, not flux. But I think for this purpose, flux and luminosity are proportional.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius differently. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the effective temperature is given, but perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation in terms of the star's flux change when the planet transits, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's area to the spotted area, but that doesn't make sense because the planet's area isn't related to the spots' area.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So perhaps the maximum variation in brightness (the amplitude) is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

So, given that, but the calculation leads to a planet radius of about 0.23 R_star, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot area is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2=0.8 pi R^2.

In that case, the delta calculation would be:

delta = (0.8 pi R^2 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4)) / (4 pi R^2 *6e3^4 )

= (0.8/4) * (6.71e14/1.296e15) =0.2 * (0.517)=0.1034.

So, 10.34% dip.

Then, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1034) ≈0.3216 R_star, which is close to option D) 0.32.

So perhaps the mistake was in the initial assumption that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Maybe the problem means 20% of the entire star's surface.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the options are wrong. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. So perhaps the correct calculation uses 0.8 pi R² as the spot area.

In that case, the correct answer would be 0.32 R_star, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem intended the spot area to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Given that, I'll proceed with option D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude signal) as the spotted star, we compare the fractional dip in brightness caused by the spots to the dip caused by the planet. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (T_spot = 5000 K).

### Step 1: Calculate the fractional dip caused by the spots
The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), and the area of the spotted hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \). The filling factor of 20% means the spotted area is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \). When the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, the flux from the star decreases due to the cooler spots. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \), so the total flux without spots is:

\[
F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times 4\pi R^2
\]

When the spots are visible, the flux is:

\[
F_{\text{min}} = \left[(4\pi R^2 - 0.4\pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4\right] + \left[0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4\right]
\]

The fractional dip is:

\[
\delta = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{min}}}{F_0}
\]

Substituting \( F_0 - F_{\text{min}} = 0.4\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4) \), we get:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.4}{4} \times \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

### Step 2: Compute numerical values
- \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \, \text{K}^4 \)
- \( T_{\text{spot}}^4 = (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \, \text{K}^4 \)
- \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14} \, \text{K}^4 \)

Substitute into the equation for \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = 0.1 \times \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1 \times 0.517 = 0.0517
\]

Thus, the fractional dip caused by the spots is approximately \( \delta = 0.0517 \) or \( 5.17\% \).

### Step 3: Relate the dip to the exoplanet's radius
The dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:

\[
\delta_{\text{planet}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]

To match the dip caused by the spots, we set \( \delta_{\text{planet}} = \delta \):

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.0517
\]

Take the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0517} \approx 0.227
\]

### Step 4: Reconcile with the options
The calculated value \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem instead assumes that the filling factor of 20% applies to the entire star (not just one hemisphere), the total spotted area would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2 \). Recomputing \( \delta \) with this assumption:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.8\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

\[
\delta = 0.2 \times \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.2 \times 0.517 = 0.1034
\]

Now, \( \delta_{\text{planet}} = 0.1034 \), so:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1034} \approx 0.321
\]

This matches option **D) ~0.32**. Therefore, the problem likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star, not just one hemisphere.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is about how this situation can mimic an exoplanet's effect, and what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm. So the main point is comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots. The problem wants to know the exoplanet radius relative to the star's radius so that the dip in brightness (the signal) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait. The question states that to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So if the star wasn't spotted, what would cause the same brightness variation? An exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So we're comparing the brightness drop from the planet to the brightness drop from the spots.

So first, I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let's break it down. The star's brightness (or luminosity) comes from its surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the total brightness is a bit less. But because only one hemisphere is spotted, the amount of spots that are visible depends on the star's rotation.

Wait, no. The problem says that when the star is observed, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum and minimum brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots are moving, but the star's overall brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas. So the observed brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area that we see as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere. So when we view the star, we see part of the spotted hemisphere and part not. So the brightness will vary depending on how much of the spotted area is facing us.

Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star. So if the star's rotation axis is such that only one hemisphere is spotted, then as it rotates, the amount of the spotted area in our view changes. So when the spot is at the edge, we see a part, and when it's facing us, we see the full extent. But I'm not sure if the star's rotation is such that the spots are entirely in view or moving in and out.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) )? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the hemisphere's area is (4π R² / 2) = 2 π R². Wait, no. A hemisphere's surface area is half of the total surface area of a sphere, which is 4π R². So each hemisphere is 2π R². But the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the full spots, so the dip in brightness would be the area of the spots times the temperature difference, I think.

Wait, no. The star's brightness is determined by the sum of the emission from all its surface. Each small patch of the star emits according to its temperature. So the total flux (brightness) is the sum of fluxes from each part.

The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. So the total flux from the star when part of it is cooler (spots) is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

So the star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R^2). But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the flux lost due to the spots. 

Wait, no. The total flux when spots are present is the sum of the normal flux minus the spots' contribution. Let me think again. 

The total flux when spots are present is [ (Area without spots) * F_unspotted + (Area with spots) * F_spotted ].

Because F_unspotted is σ T_eff^4, and F_spotted is σ (T_eff - 1000 K)^4? Wait, no. The problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Does that mean T_spot = T_eff - 1000? Or is it a temperature difference of 1000 K, perhaps in the opposite direction? Hmm, the problem states "temperature difference of 1000 K," but it's unclear which way. But since the spots are dark, they're cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K, I suppose.

Wait, wait. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So the flux from each spot is σ*(5000)^4, and the flux from the rest of the star is σ*(6000)^4.

The total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us is F = (Area_unspotted * σ 6000^4) + (Area_spotted * σ 5000^4).

But when the spots are on the other side, the flux is F0 = 4π R^2 * σ 6000^4.

The variation in flux is the change when the star rotates, bringing the spots into view. But wait, the star is rotating, but only one hemisphere is spotted. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. When it's not, the flux is at its maximum.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spot coverage is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 π R^2) ) = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 - (0.4 π R²) * (σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)).

Wait, no, because the spots are at a lower temperature. So the flux from the spots is less than the surrounding. So the total flux is (F0) minus the (difference in flux per unit area) multiplied by the area of the spots.

The difference in flux per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4) * σ.

Wait, but when the star's not spotted, the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (Area_spotted) * (σ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ).

So the change in flux, ΔF, is the difference between F0 and F, which is (Area_spotted) * (σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The flux without spots is F0 = (4 π R^2) * σ 6000^4.

With spots, the flux is F = (4 π R^2 - Area_spotted) * σ 6000^4 + Area_spotted * σ 5000^4.

So the flux variation when the spots are visible is (F - F0) = - Area_spotted * σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

The maximum dip in brightness is when the spotted area is fully visible. So the maximum dip is ΔF = F0 - F = Area_spotted * σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

Wait, but the flux would be lower when the spots are visible, so the variation would be a decrease of ΔF.

The relative change is ΔF / F0, which is the fractional dip. 

So the fractional dip (δ) is [ (Area_spotted) * (6000^4 -5000^4) ) / (4 π R^2 * 6000^4) ) ].

Simplify this:

δ = (Area_spotted) * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 π R^2 * 6000^4 )

We can factor 6000^4 as 6^4 * 10^12 (since 6000 is 6e3, so 6^4 is 1296, 10^3^4 is 1e12) but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical values.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625)*1e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Now, the Area_spotted is 0.4 π R^2.

So δ = (0.4 π R²) * (6.71e14) / (4 π R² * 1.296e15 )

Simplify this: The R² and π cancel out.

δ = (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Compute numerator: 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

So δ = (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 ) ≈ 0.0517.

So about 5.17% dip.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the photometric time-series is showing variation due to the spots, which can mimic an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the dip due to the planet would need to match this 5.17% dip.

Now, what's the dip caused by an exoplanet? When a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2, so the ratio is (R_p / R_s)^2.

So we set this ratio equal to the dip we calculated, which is 0.0517.

So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.0517.

Take square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but wait. The dip from the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2, which is 0.0517, so R_p is about 0.227 times R_s. But none of the options are around 0.227. Let's check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, 0.227 isn't among them. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check calculations.

Wait, in the spot calculation, I assumed that when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the dip is maximum. But perhaps that's not correct. Because the star is a sphere, and when we view the star, the area of the hemisphere that is visible is 2 pi R², as before.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. The area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the visible portion of the spotted hemisphere varies. Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, so the spots are not visible, and the star's flux is at maximum.

Wait, but for a star, when you have a hemisphere covered in spots, the maximum dip occurs when the hemisphere is facing us. So the dip is as computed.

Wait, but wait, when a planet transits, it covers a circular area. So the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. So the dip from the planet is when the planet is in front, covering a circular area. So if the dip from the planet is the same as the dip from the spots, then R_p is sqrt(δ) times R_s.

Wait, in our calculation δ is 0.0517, so sqrt(0.0517) is approximately 0.227, which is about 0.23 R_s. But none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute the dip calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate in and out of view, so the maximum dip isn't when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, but perhaps when only part is visible. No, because the maximum dip would occur when the maximum area of the spots is visible. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum would be when that hemisphere is fully visible, so the dip is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere has spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. So the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2. So spots' area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. That part seems correct.

Then, the flux change when the spots are visible is (0.4 pi R^2) * (sigma) * (6000^4 -5000^4).

Wait, but the star's total flux without spots is sigma * 6000^4 * 4 pi R^2. So the dip is (0.4 pi R²) * (6000^4 -5000^4) * sigma divided by (4 pi R² sigma 6000^4).

Simplify: The dip delta is (0.4 pi R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4)) / (4 pi R^2 6000^4 ) ) * sigma/sigma cancels. So numerator: 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4), denominator:4 *6000^4.

Wait, so delta = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 *6000^4 ].

Wait, 0.4 /4 is 0.1.

So delta = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4 )

Hmm, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e15, 5e3^4 is 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 =1.296e15 -6.25e14= 6.71e14.

So delta = 0.1 * 6.71e14 /1.296e15.

Compute 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = approximately 0.517.

So delta = 0.1 *0.517 = 0.0517, which is about 5.17% dip. So that part is correct.

So the dip from the spots is 5.17%, and the dip from the planet must be the same. So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the star's brightness is affected by both the spots and the unspotted areas, but perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness over time, not the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct area. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. The spotted area in one hemisphere is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. So when the spotted hemisphere is viewed, the area of spots is 0.4 pi R^2.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2 ) * 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 *5000^4 ] * sigma.

Wait, no, because 4 pi R^2 is the entire area. Hmm, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots; when it's not, we don't. So the maximum dip is when the hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but the star's total flux without any spots would be when no spots are present. But when spots are present, the flux is lower. So when the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is not visible (like when it's on the far side), the flux is at its maximum (F0). When the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us, the flux is at its minimum (F_min).

The dip is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = [(F0 - F_min)]/F0.

Wait, F0 is the flux without any spots, which is sigma 6000^4 * 4 pi R².

F_min is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, so F_min = [ (4 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma 6000^4 ] + [0.4 pi R² * sigma 5000^4 ].

So F_min = (3.6 pi R²) * sigma 6000^4 + (0.4 pi R²) sigma 5000^4.

So the dip is (F0 - F_min)/F0.

F0 =4 pi R² sigma 6000^4.

So F0 - F_min = 4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - [3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ]

= (4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 -3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4) - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

So dip = [0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 ].

Again, the same as before: 0.4/(4) = 0.1.

delta = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Which gives delta ≈0.0517, as before.

So the dip is about 5.17%. So the planet's dip needs to be the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rp/Rstar≈0.227.

But the options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, none of these are near 0.227. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star is being observed in a way that the spots are not completely visible, perhaps because the star's rotation makes the spots only partially visible, leading to a smaller dip. Or perhaps the maximum dip is when only a portion of the spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered with spots, so when it's viewed from Earth, the entire hemisphere is in view when the star is at a certain position. So the maximum dip is when that hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area of the spots. Let's double-check. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 pi R^2. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip differently. Because the star is being observed from Earth, and when the star rotates, only part of the spots comes into view. Wait, no. The problem states that the star's one hemisphere is entirely covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, all spots are visible. So the dip is maximum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (6000^4 -5000^4). Let me recompute that.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = (5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 =6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14. Correct.

So 6.71e14 divided by 6000^4 (1.296e15) is approximately 0.517.

So 0.1 * 0.517 is 0.0517. So the dip is 5.17%.

Wait, perhaps the planet's dip is 5.17%, so R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0517)= approx 0.227.

But none of the options are near 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dip caused by the spots is in the opposite direction. Or perhaps the problem is considering when the spots are not covering the entire hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on a hemisphere, but as the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip, but only when the spots are on the limb. No, that doesn't make sense. The maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the total variation, not the maximum dip. Wait, the problem says that the observed brightness variation is periodic, which suggests that the spots are on the surface and as the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view. But the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view with a certain phase. However, the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal-like curve, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. Or perhaps the amplitude is the peak dip. So the dip amplitude is 5.17%, which would be the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, but perhaps I got the calculation right and the options are wrong, which is unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation isn't just the dip when the spots are present, but the modulation as the spots rotate. So perhaps the variation is more complex, perhaps considering the phase curve or the rotational modulation. But I think the problem is simplifying it to the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a planet that's causing a dip of the same amplitude, but perhaps the planet's transit doesn't block the same amount of light as the spots. Wait, but the problem states that the star isn't covered by spots, so the dip is solely due to the planet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux from the star when the spots are present, but perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to not be fully visible, leading to a lower dip. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on a hemisphere, but the star's rotation means that only a fraction of the spots is visible at any time. But that doesn't seem right because the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty", implying that when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the light curve's variation over time, which would involve integrating the change as the star rotates. But that might complicate things, and the problem doesn't specify that. So I think the earlier approach is correct.

So with the dip being 5.17%, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0517) times the star's radius, which is approximately 0.227 R_star. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Let me think: the star's radius is R, so area is 4 pi R^2. A hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. No, the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots on a single face, but when the star rotates, the spots rotate into view and out of view, so the maximum area visible at any time is a certain percentage.

Wait, no, when the hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible. So the dip is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the flux is calculated. Let me think again. The flux is the sum of the flux from all areas. The unspotted parts emit at T=6000K, and the spotted parts at T=5000K.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma 6000^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma 5000^4).

Area_unspotted = 4 pi R^2 - Area_spotted.

But wait, the spotted area is 0.4 pi R^2. So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the Area_unspotted is (4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2) = 3.6 pi R^2.

Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R^2 is visible. The other hemisphere is unspotted, so 2 pi R^2 is unspotted.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the Area_unspotted is 2 pi R^2 (the other hemisphere) plus the unspotted part of the current hemisphere.

Wait, no, the hemisphere is either spotted or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R^2 is visible as spots, and the remaining 1.6 pi R^2 is unspotted. So the total unspotted area is 2 pi R^2 (other hemisphere) + (2 pi R^2 -0.4 pi R^2) (unspotted part of current hemisphere) = 2 pi R^2 + 1.6 pi R^2 =3.6 pi R^2.

So when the spots are fully visible, the flux is:

F = (3.6 pi R^2 * sigma 6000^4) + (0.4 pi R^2 * sigma 5000^4).

So the dip is (F0 - F)/F0, where F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4.

So F0 - F = 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 - [3.6 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4 ]

= (0.4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4) - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

So dip delta = [0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 ].

Same as before: 0.4/(4) = 0.1, so 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 =0.1 * 0.517 =0.0517.

So the dip is 5.17% as before.

So, the planet's R_p must satisfy (R_p / R_star)^2 =0.0517 → R_p = 0.227 R_star.

But the options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the spot filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. But the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere and the planet's dip is when the planet covers part of the star. But the planet can cover any part, including the spots, which might change the dip. But the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots", so the planet's dip would be based on the star's full emission.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way: the dip due to the planet is the same as the dip due to the spots. So R_p^2/R_star^2 = 0.0517 → R_p/R_star =sqrt(0.0517)=0.227.

But options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the delta. Let me recalculate.

Wait, computing 6000^4 and 5000^4 accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 =1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4=1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 -0.625) *1e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So (6000^4 -5000^4) =6.71e14.

Then delta = 0.1 * 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = 0.1 * (6.71 /12.96) ≈ 0.1 *0.517=0.0517.

So delta is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than that. So T_spot =6000-1000=5000 K. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the entire star changes, but no, because the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots' rotation, not the overall temperature.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the change in the star's brightness as a function of rotation, and the amplitude of this change is what's being compared to the planet's transit. But how?

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't a simple dip, but a periodic modulation, which could have a certain amplitude. For example, the star's brightness varies as the spots come into view, and the amplitude could be the peak-to-peak variation, which might involve twice the dip. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the maximum dip is 5.17%, and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, which is 100% of the star's light. So the peak-to-peak variation would be 5.17% (from F0 to F_min), but that's the same as the dip. So the amplitude is 5.17%.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of the same amplitude. So back to R_p/R_s=0.227.

No option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the light curve's variation as a fraction of the star's brightness, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. Let me try that.

If the spot area is 20% of the entire star's surface (4 pi R^2), then the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2 =0.8 pi R^2.

Then, delta = [0.8 pi R^2 * (6000^4-5000^4)] / [4 pi R^2 *6000^4 ].

So 0.8/(4) = 0.2.

delta =0.2 * (6.71e14 /1.296e15) =0.2 *0.517=0.1034, about 10.34% dip.

Then, the planet's R_p would be sqrt(0.1034) ≈0.321 R_s. So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So perhaps I misread the problem and the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) )=0.4 pi R^2.

But if I instead consider that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2=0.8 pi R^2.

But the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the spots are 20% of the hemisphere. So perhaps I should stick with the initial approach.

Wait, but if I get delta=0.0517, and none of the options match, but if I recalculate with the spot area being 0.8 pi R^2, I get delta=0.1034, which is option D (0.32 R).

So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2 )=0.4 pi R^2.

But perhaps when the star rotates, the spots are only visible for a certain fraction of the time, leading to an average dip. But that wouldn't make sense because the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, not the average.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to both the spots and the unspotted areas as the star rotates, leading to a sinusoidal variation whose amplitude equals the maximum dip we calculated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the star's rotation, which would involve integrating the change as the spots rotate into view, but that seems more complex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the effective area covered by the spots as seen from Earth. Since the star is a sphere, when a spot is on the limb, it's only a small part of the area that's visible. Wait, but when the entire hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible.

Hmm.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the areas again. Let me think.

The dip is 5.17%, so the planet's area blocked is 5.17% of the star's area.

So the planet's area is 0.0517 * (4 pi R^2) = (R_p^2 / R^2 ) *4 pi R^2 → R_p^2 =0.0517 *4 pi R^2 /4 pi → R_p^2=0.0517 R^2. So R_p=0.227 R.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the planet's transit causing a dip in flux, but the star's flux is higher due to the spots. No, because the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", so the star's flux is the same as a normal star, so the dip would be due to the planet.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots cause a variation in brightness, and the planet's transit would also cause a variation of the same amplitude. So perhaps the amplitude is the same, but the dip is different.

Wait, but the dip is the amplitude, so that shouldn't change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux, not the absolute dip. But I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's brightness as a function of time. When the star is unspotted, the brightness is F0. When the spots are visible, it's F_min = F0 - delta_F.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is delta_F.

The planet's transit would cause a variation of (R_p/R_star)^2 * F0. So to match the amplitude, (R_p/R_star)^2 = delta_F/F0.

But delta_F is 0.0517 F0, so (R_p/R_star)^2=0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_star.

Still, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the star's rotation as a sinusoidal function, and the amplitude is half the maximum dip. So the amplitude would be delta_F/2.

But that would make the amplitude 2.585%, so R_p= sqrt(0.02585)=0.160 R_star. Still, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots and the planet, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, but considering that the spot area is 0.4 pi R^2, and the dip is 0.0517. So the planet's area is 0.0517 of the star's area.

Star's area is 4 pi R^2.

So planet's area is 0.0517 *4 pi R^2 = 0.2068 pi R^2.

Planet's area is pi R_p^2 =0.2068 pi R^2 → R_p^2=0.2068 R^2 → R_p= sqrt(0.2068) R ≈0.4546 R. But that's larger than any of the options, and option A is 0.39, which is close but not exact.

No, that can't be right because the dip from the planet would be R_p^2/R^2, which is 0.2068, so 20.68% dip, which is much larger than our calculated 5.17%.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the spots as a function of the star's rotation period, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots as a function of their position on the star's surface, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. So the maximum dip is 5.17%, and the maximum increase is when the spots are on the far side, so the flux is 100% of F0. So the peak-to-peak variation is 5.17% of F0. So the amplitude is 5.17% of F0, same as the dip.

So the planet's transit dip would have to be 5.17% of F0, leading to R_p=0.227 R.

No matching option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the calculation is done in terms of luminosity, not flux. But I think for this purpose, flux and luminosity are proportional.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius differently. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the effective temperature is given, but perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation in terms of the star's flux change when the planet transits, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's area to the spotted area, but that doesn't make sense because the planet's area isn't related to the spots' area.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So perhaps the maximum variation in brightness (the amplitude) is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

So, given that, but the calculation leads to a planet radius of about 0.23 R_star, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot area is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 *4 pi R^2=0.8 pi R^2.

In that case, the delta calculation would be:

delta = (0.8 pi R^2 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4)) / (4 pi R^2 *6e3^4 )

= (0.8/4) * (6.71e14/1.296e15) =0.2 * (0.517)=0.1034.

So, 10.34% dip.

Then, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1034) ≈0.3216 R_star, which is close to option D) 0.32.

So perhaps the mistake was in the initial assumption that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Maybe the problem means 20% of the entire star's surface.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the options are wrong. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. So perhaps the correct calculation uses 0.8 pi R² as the spot area.

In that case, the correct answer would be 0.32 R_star, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem intended the spot area to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Given that, I'll proceed with option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude signal) as the spotted star, we compare the fractional dip in brightness caused by the spots to the dip caused by the planet. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (T_spot = 5000 K).

### Step 1: Calculate the fractional dip caused by the spots
The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), and the area of the spotted hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \). The filling factor of 20% means the spotted area is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \). When the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, the flux from the star decreases due to the cooler spots. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \), so the total flux without spots is:

\[
F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times 4\pi R^2
\]

When the spots are visible, the flux is:

\[
F_{\text{min}} = \left[(4\pi R^2 - 0.4\pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4\right] + \left[0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4\right]
\]

The fractional dip is:

\[
\delta = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{min}}}{F_0}
\]

Substituting \( F_0 - F_{\text{min}} = 0.4\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4) \), we get:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.4}{4} \times \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

### Step 2: Compute numerical values
- \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \, \text{K}^4 \)
- \( T_{\text{spot}}^4 = (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \, \text{K}^4 \)
- \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14} \, \text{K}^4 \)

Substitute into the equation for \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = 0.1 \times \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1 \times 0.517 = 0.0517
\]

Thus, the fractional dip caused by the spots is approximately \( \delta = 0.0517 \) or \( 5.17\% \).

### Step 3: Relate the dip to the exoplanet's radius
The dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:

\[
\delta_{\text{planet}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]

To match the dip caused by the spots, we set \( \delta_{\text{planet}} = \delta \):

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.0517
\]

Take the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0517} \approx 0.227
\]

### Step 4: Reconcile with the options
The calculated value \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem instead assumes that the filling factor of 20% applies to the entire star (not just one hemisphere), the total spotted area would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2 \). Recomputing \( \delta \) with this assumption:

\[
\delta = \frac{0.8\pi R^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]

\[
\delta = 0.2 \times \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.2 \times 0.517 = 0.1034
\]

Now, \( \delta_{\text{planet}} = 0.1034 \), so:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1034} \approx 0.321
\]

This matches option **D) ~0.32**. Therefore, the problem likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star, not just one hemisphere.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
