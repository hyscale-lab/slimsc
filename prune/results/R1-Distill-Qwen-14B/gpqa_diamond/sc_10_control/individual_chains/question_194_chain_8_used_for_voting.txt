Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all the possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin S can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll list them out. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3).

Let me list all possible combinations:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E.

The energy expression is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let me compute each part.

Let me make a table to compute E for each state.

State 1: (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1
S1S3 = 1
S2S3 = 1
Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 =3
E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=(-1), S2S3=(-1)
Sum=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2= (-1), S1S3=1, S2S3= (-1)
Sum= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1
E= J

State 4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=(-1), S2S3=1
Sum = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1
E= J

State 5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2= (-1), S1S3=1, S2S3=1
Sum= (-1) +1 +1 =1
E= -J*(1) = -J

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck that. E is -J times the sum. So for state 5, sum is (-1) +1 +1 =1, so E = -J*(1) = -J? Wait, no. Wait, the sum is 1, so E = -J *1 = -J.

Wait, wait. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recompute.

Wait, for state 5: S1 is -1, S2 is +1, S3 is +1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1
So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, that changes things. I think I made a mistake earlier.

So let me correct that.

State 5: sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, let's go through each state again.

State 1: sum 3 → E=-3J
State 2: sum=1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J
State3: sum=-1 +1 -1 =-1 → E=J
State4: sum=-1 -1 +1= -1 → E=J
State5: sum=-1 -1 +1= -1 → E=J
State6: Let's compute it.

State6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=(-1)(+1)=-1
S1S3=(-1)(-1)=1
S2S3=(+1)(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) =-1 → E= J

State7: (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1
Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) =-1 → E= J

State8: (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3 → E= -3J

Wait, this is a bit tedious, but I need to get this right.

So, let me summarize the energies for each state:

1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J → e^(-β E) = e^(3Jβ)
2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J → e^(-β J)
3. (+1, -1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
4. (+1, -1, -1): E=J → e^(-β J)
5. (-1, +1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
6. (-1, +1, -1): E=J → e^(-β J)
7. (-1, -1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
8. (-1, -1, -1): E=-3J → e^(3Jβ)

Wait a minute, but no. Because E is negative J times the sum. Let me recompute each state.

Wait, when I have E = -J*(sum). So if sum is 3, E is -3J. If sum is -1, E is J. Because E = -J*(-1) = J.

So for each state, E is either -3J (when sum is 3) or J (when sum is -1, which is the case for all the other states except state 1 and 8).

Wait, looking again at all the states:

State 1: sum=3 → E=-3J
States 2,3,4,5,6,7: sum=-1 → E=J
State 8: sum=3 → E=-3J

So out of 8 states, 2 have E=-3J, and 6 have E=J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over each state of e^(-β E).

So Z = [number of states with E=-3J] * e^(β*3J) + [number of states with E=J] * e^(-β*J)

Because for each of the 2 states where E=-3J, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β*(-3J)) = e^(3β J). For the 6 states where E=J, the factor is e^(-β J).

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}

Wait, looking back at the options, let's see:

Option B says Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Which is exactly what I have. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ} → no. Because for E=-3J, the exponential is positive.

Option B is what I have. So the answer is option B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we use the energy expression \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Each spin triplet \((S_1, S_2, S_3)\) represents a state, and there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. For each state, the energy \( E \) is calculated, and the corresponding Boltzmann factor \( e^{-\beta E} \) is determined.

### Step 1: List all states and compute their energies
1. **(+1, +1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

2. **(+1, +1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

3. **(+1, -1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

4. **(+1, -1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

5. **(-1, +1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 + 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

6. **(-1, +1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

7. **(-1, -1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

8. **(-1, -1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

### Step 2: Classify states by energy
- **Energy \( E = -3J \):** 2 states \((+1, +1, +1)\) and \((-1, -1, -1)\).
- **Energy \( E = J \):** 6 states \((+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \left( \text{Number of states with } E = -3J \right) e^{3J\beta} + \left( \text{Number of states with } E = J \right) e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Substituting the counts:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
From the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents and coefficients).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all the possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin S can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll list them out. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3).

Let me list all possible combinations:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E.

The energy expression is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let me compute each part.

Let me make a table to compute E for each state.

State 1: (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1
S1S3 = 1
S2S3 = 1
Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 =3
E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=(-1), S2S3=(-1)
Sum=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2= (-1), S1S3=1, S2S3= (-1)
Sum= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1
E= J

State 4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=(-1), S2S3=1
Sum = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1
E= J

State 5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2= (-1), S1S3=1, S2S3=1
Sum= (-1) +1 +1 =1
E= -J*(1) = -J

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck that. E is -J times the sum. So for state 5, sum is (-1) +1 +1 =1, so E = -J*(1) = -J? Wait, no. Wait, the sum is 1, so E = -J *1 = -J.

Wait, wait. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recompute.

Wait, for state 5: S1 is -1, S2 is +1, S3 is +1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1
So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, that changes things. I think I made a mistake earlier.

So let me correct that.

State 5: sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, let's go through each state again.

State 1: sum 3 → E=-3J
State 2: sum=1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J
State3: sum=-1 +1 -1 =-1 → E=J
State4: sum=-1 -1 +1= -1 → E=J
State5: sum=-1 -1 +1= -1 → E=J
State6: Let's compute it.

State6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=(-1)(+1)=-1
S1S3=(-1)(-1)=1
S2S3=(+1)(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) =-1 → E= J

State7: (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1
Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) =-1 → E= J

State8: (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3 → E= -3J

Wait, this is a bit tedious, but I need to get this right.

So, let me summarize the energies for each state:

1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J → e^(-β E) = e^(3Jβ)
2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J → e^(-β J)
3. (+1, -1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
4. (+1, -1, -1): E=J → e^(-β J)
5. (-1, +1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
6. (-1, +1, -1): E=J → e^(-β J)
7. (-1, -1, +1): E=J → e^(-β J)
8. (-1, -1, -1): E=-3J → e^(3Jβ)

Wait a minute, but no. Because E is negative J times the sum. Let me recompute each state.

Wait, when I have E = -J*(sum). So if sum is 3, E is -3J. If sum is -1, E is J. Because E = -J*(-1) = J.

So for each state, E is either -3J (when sum is 3) or J (when sum is -1, which is the case for all the other states except state 1 and 8).

Wait, looking again at all the states:

State 1: sum=3 → E=-3J
States 2,3,4,5,6,7: sum=-1 → E=J
State 8: sum=3 → E=-3J

So out of 8 states, 2 have E=-3J, and 6 have E=J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over each state of e^(-β E).

So Z = [number of states with E=-3J] * e^(β*3J) + [number of states with E=J] * e^(-β*J)

Because for each of the 2 states where E=-3J, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β*(-3J)) = e^(3β J). For the 6 states where E=J, the factor is e^(-β J).

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}

Wait, looking back at the options, let's see:

Option B says Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Which is exactly what I have. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ} → no. Because for E=-3J, the exponential is positive.

Option B is what I have. So the answer is option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we use the energy expression \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Each spin triplet \((S_1, S_2, S_3)\) represents a state, and there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. For each state, the energy \( E \) is calculated, and the corresponding Boltzmann factor \( e^{-\beta E} \) is determined.

### Step 1: List all states and compute their energies
1. **(+1, +1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

2. **(+1, +1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

3. **(+1, -1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

4. **(+1, -1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

5. **(-1, +1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 + 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

6. **(-1, +1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

7. **(-1, -1, +1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

8. **(-1, -1, -1):**  
   \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

### Step 2: Classify states by energy
- **Energy \( E = -3J \):** 2 states \((+1, +1, +1)\) and \((-1, -1, -1)\).
- **Energy \( E = J \):** 6 states \((+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \left( \text{Number of states with } E = -3J \right) e^{3J\beta} + \left( \text{Number of states with } E = J \right) e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Substituting the counts:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
From the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents and coefficients).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
