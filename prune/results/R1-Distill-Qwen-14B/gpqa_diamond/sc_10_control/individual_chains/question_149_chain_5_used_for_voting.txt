Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a peptidic compound's analysis. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to one proton. The question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out because of the coupling pattern. So, I don't think it's something like a coupling between neighboring protons causing this.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but there are two separate peaks. Wait, but how does that happen if the mass is the same?

The options are A to D. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it were a precursor, I think the mass would be different. Because a precursor is usually a molecule that's one step before—like the reactant that hasn't undergone a reaction yet. So its molecular weight would be higher by the mass of the functional group that's added. But in the question, the LC-MS shows the same mass as expected, so A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight and same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. But in LC-MS, would they show as separate peaks? Wait, I'm a bit confused here. High-performance liquid chromatography can separate enantiomers if the column is chiral. But if the column is achiral, the enantiomers would co-elute. However, the question says they used LC-MS at elevated temperature. So if it's a chiral column, and the two peaks are same mass, maybe they are enantiomers. But then, why would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton? Because enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra since they have the same environment for protons. So wait, that's conflicting. Because if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR should just see one peak, right? Because the environments are the same for each set of protons. So this might not explain the NMR issue. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm not considering something. Oh wait, the question states that the two peaks in the NMR are the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule is a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would not show separate peaks for each enantiomer's protons; they would merge into a single peak because the environments are identical. So this suggests that B might not be the correct answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction. I'm not entirely sure what 'double coupling' refers to here. Maybe something like having two coupling partners? Or perhaps a situation where the proton couples with two different types of protons, leading to multiple peaks. But I thought the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So maybe C is not the right explanation.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would separate on a regular HPLC column. So in LC-MS, you would see two peaks with the same molecular weight (since they are diastereomers, same molecular formula) but different retention times. And in the NMR, each diastereomer would have a different environment for the protons. So for the alpha-proton, each diastereomer's proton would have a different shift. But wait, the question says the two NMR peaks are for the same alpha-proton, and their shifts are similar. They integrate to 1H together, which suggests each peak is about 0.5H. Hmm, but if the diastereomers are present, each would have their own set of protons. Wait, but if the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, their chemical shifts would be different. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So that's a bit conflicting. Or maybe if the two diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, but that's unlikely unless they're diastereomers with only some stereocenters differing but the alpha proton's environment is the same.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. But because the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each would have slightly different chemical environments for that proton. But if the diastereomers have the same environment for that proton, then the NMR would show a single peak. So maybe the two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton but differ in other protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers are in a situation where the alpha proton's environment is the same. How? For example, if the diastereomers have the same configuration at that position. Wait, but diastereomers have differing configurations in some stereocenters. Suppose the alpha-proton is in a position that isn't a stereocenter, or it's part of a symmetric group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other clues.

The NMR shows two peaks with similar shifts and the integrals add to 1H. So if the alpha proton is split into two because of something else, but each peak is 0.5H. If the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers that both have the same alpha proton, then the NMR would show two peaks for each. Wait, no, because each diastereomer would contribute their own set of protons. So for each diastereomer, the same alpha proton would give a peak, but at slightly different shifts. So if you have a 50:50 mixture, the two peaks would be close together but split into two. But in the question, the integrals add to 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H. That makes sense if each diastereomer has 0.5H of that proton. Wait, but the integral is for the number of protons. So, perhaps each diastereomer contributes 0.5H each. But that seems a bit odd.

Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers are in a situation where the alpha proton is coupled to another proton, but I thought the question ruled that out. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the options. Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. If the compound is a racemic mixture, that's enantiomers. But racemic mixtures have same physical properties except for direction of rotation. So in LC-MS, if the column is chiral, it would separate them, but if achiral, they would co-elute. But in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass. So they must be separated. That suggests a chiral column or that the analytes are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated on a regular HPLC column.

So, for the NMR, if the mixture is diastereomers, each would have a different environment for some protons. So for the alpha-proton, perhaps in each diastereomer, the shift is slightly different, but similar enough that they appear as two separate peaks. So the two diastereomers contribute their own alpha-proton signals, giving two peaks with similar shifts. The integrals would add up to 1H because each diastereomer has one alpha-proton. Hmm, that makes sense. So if each diastereomer has one alpha-proton, then each contributes 0.5H, but together they make 1H.

So then why wouldn't the coupling be an issue? Because the coupling pattern is ruled out as the cause. So the two peaks are not due to spin-spin coupling, but due to two separate molecules (diastereomers) each contributing their own alpha-proton peak.

So putting it all together: the NMR shows two alpha-proton peaks (each diastereomer contributes one, same shift but two peaks), and the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass but different retention times (because diastereomers). So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but what about option C? 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Maybe if during the reaction, a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons? Or perhaps if there's some rearrangement causing an unexpected coupling. But the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. So I think C is not the right choice.

So the best fit is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a different molecular weight, as it represents an earlier stage in the synthesis. However, the LC-MS analysis shows peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out contamination with a precursor. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including the same NMR spectrum. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, as the environments for the protons would be identical. Since the NMR shows two distinct peaks, this explanation is inconsistent with the observations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. While "double coupling" could theoretically involve a proton interacting with two different protons, this explanation does not align with the observed NMR and LC-MS data. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, and they have different physical properties. This explains why the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass but different retention times. In the NMR spectrum, each diastereomer contributes its own alpha-proton signal, resulting in two peaks with similar chemical shifts. The integrals adding up to 1H are consistent with each diastereomer contributing 0.5H of the alpha-proton. This explanation aligns with both the NMR and LC-MS data, making it the most plausible option.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
