Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that bubble chambers are used to detect particle tracks, right? The question is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think the key here is to determine the speed of the X⁰ particle because the lifetime is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime dilates due to time dilation. So to find the actual lifetime in the lab frame, I need to multiply tau_0 by gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But to find gamma, maybe it's easier to calculate the beta factor (beta = v/c) first. Beta is equal to the momentum divided by the energy of the particle. Oh wait, in high-energy physics, they often use units where c is 1, so energy (E), momentum (p), and mass (m) are related by E² = p² + m².

Right, so X⁰ has an energy of 27 GeV. Its mass is 3.41 GeV. So the momentum p can be found using E² = p² + m². Let me calculate that.

E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So p² = E² - m² = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2. Let me compute that. 27 squared is 729, and 3.41 squared is approximately 11.6281. So p² is 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719. So p = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.79 GeV/c.

Then, beta is p divided by E. So beta = 26.79 / 27 ≈ 0.9922. So beta is about 0.9922, which makes sense because at high energies, beta approaches 1.

Now, gamma is E / m. Wait, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV, so gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Because gamma is E/m when E is much larger than m, which it is here.

So the dilated lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. Let me compute that. Tau = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate 7.917*8: 8 *7 is 56, 0.917*8≈7.336, so total about 63.336e-16 s, approximately 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait, is that right? Let me check the calculation again. 7.917 * 8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 seconds is 6.3336e-15 seconds. Yeah that seems right.

Now, the particles will move a certain distance before decaying. The distance L is v * tau. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the particles travel further before decaying.

Wait, but v = beta * c. So L = beta * c * tau. So plugging in the numbers, beta is approximately 0.9922, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Tau is 6.3336e-15 s.

So let me compute each part. Beta * c = 0.9922 * 3e8 ≈ 2.9766e8 m/s. Multiply by tau: 2.9766e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Hmm, let me compute 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15. Let's see, 2.9766 *6.3336 is approximately 18.82. Then, 1e8 * 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.82e-7 meters, which is 1.882e-6 meters, or about 1.88 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think I need to find the length that allows us to observe 30% of the decays. Because not all particles will decay along the same path; some will decay earlier, some later.

But wait, in a bubble chamber, the particle moves and decays, and we can see the decay products if the decay vertex is within the chamber's resolution. The resolution is the minimum distance we can distinguish between two points. So if the particle's decay length is L, the fraction of decays that happen within a certain distance depends on the exponential decay law.

The decay follows an exponential probability, so the probability that the decay happens within a distance x is 1 - e^(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length. Wait, no, actually, the decay probability is proportional to (1 - e^(-x/L)). But wait, the probability that the particle decays before traveling a distance x is given by P = 1 - e^(-x/(c tau)), but wait, no, the mean lifetime is tau, so the proper lifetime.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. The proper lifetime is tau_0, but the actual lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0, so the mean path length is L = beta gamma c tau_0. Wait, no, because L = v * tau. v is beta c, tau is gamma tau_0. So L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but we already calculated L as approximately 1.88e-6 meters. So that's the average decay length.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So what does that mean? I think that if the decay occurs within a certain length from the point of origin, we can observe it. So if the resolution is R, we need to have enough decays within R for us to detect at least 30% of them.

Wait, perhaps it's about the decay length. The fraction of the decays that occur within a certain length. For that, the formula is (1 - e^{-x/L}) = 0.3, since 30% is 0.3 in decimal.

Wait, because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the cumulative distribution function is F(x) = 1 - e^{-x/L}, where x is the decay distance. So we need F(x) >= 0.3.

Wait, no. Since the particle decays with probability proportional to the time, the fraction that decay before x is F(x) = 1 - e^{-x/(L)}. Because the average distance is L. So if we set F(x) = 0.3, then 1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 → e^{-x/L} = 0.7 → -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = -L ln(0.7).

Wait, wait, ln(0.7) is negative. So x = L * ln(1/0.7) = L * ln(10/7) ≈ L * 0.35667.

So x ≈ 0.35667 * L.

But wait, I'm trying to find the minimum x such that at least 30% of the particles decay within x. So F(x) >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-x/L} >= 0.3 → x >= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x >= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So the length we need is about 35.67% of the mean decay length. So the minimum x required is 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but wait, no: the mean decay length is L. So to capture at least 30% of the decays, we can compute x such that F(x) = 0.3. So x ≈ L * ln(1/(1 - 0.3)) → x = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So the minimum x is approximately 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but if the question is about the minimum resolution, perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish two decay points. So if the average decay length is L, but the resolution is R, then we need R to be such that a significant fraction (30%) of the particles decay within R, so that we can detect them. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution is the maximum distance over which the decay is observed. So if the decay occurs beyond the resolution, we can't see it. So to capture 30% of the decays, the resolution should be R >= x, where x is the point where 30% of the decays have happened by that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the minimum resolution is the minimum distance that allows us to observe the decay, and we need to find the length x where 30% of the decays have occurred by that point, which is the x we calculated.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution, which I think is the minimum distance that allows detection of at least 30% of the decays. So if the resolution is R, then the fraction of decays observed is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}. We want F(R) ≥ 0.3.

So solving for R:

1 - e^{-R/L} ≥ 0.3 → e^{-R/L} ≤ 0.7 → -R/L ≤ ln(0.7) → R ≥ L * ln(0.7^{-1}) → R ≥ L * ln(1/0.7) → R ≥ L * 0.3567.

So the minimum resolution is R = 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the mean decay length is L. So if the resolution R is the maximum distance you can resolve, then the fraction of decays observed is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.

We want F(R) ≥ 0.3 → R ≥ L * ln(1/ (1-0.3)) → R ≥ L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L.

But wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So the resolution must be at least R, where R is the value we just calculated, 0.3567 L.

But wait, that would mean R is about 35% of L. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the minimum distance such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. So if the average distance is L, then 30% occurs within x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x ≈ 0.3567 L.

So the minimum resolution needed is R ≈ 0.3567 L.

But wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the smallest R such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, R must be such that the probability of a decay occurring within R is 30%, which is 0.3.

So, the formula is F(R) = 1 - e^{- R / L} = 0.3.

So, R = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) ) → R = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So R ≈ 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but I had L as approximately 1.88e-6 meters. So R would be 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 m ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 meters or 0.67 micrometers.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, none of the options are around 6e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I compute L correctly? Let me double-check the numbers.

E = 27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p² = E² - m² = 27² - 3.41² → 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 → p ≈ sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.79 GeV/c.

So beta = p/E = 26.79 / 27 ≈ 0.9922.

Gamma = E / m = 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.917.

So the lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = 63.336e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Then, L = beta c tau = 0.9922 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.9922 * 3e8 = 2.9766e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3336e-15 s: 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15.

First, multiply the coefficients: 2.9766 * 6.3336 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.9766 * 6 = 17.8596
2.9766 * 0.3336 ≈ 0.9922 (since 2.9766 * 0.333 is approx 0.992)
So total ≈ 17.8596 + 0.9922 ≈ 18.8518.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-15 = 1e-7.

So 18.8518e-7 m = 1.88518e-6 meters, approximately 1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers.

So L ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

So R = 0.3567 * L ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885 ≈ 0.673e-6 m, which is 6.73e-7 m, or 0.673 micrometers.

But looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), option D is 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), which is way bigger. Hmm, none of the options match 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution (like the minimum distance that can be resolved) such that 30% of the decays are observed. If the resolution is R, then the fraction observed is 1 - e^{-R/(L)}. So to have at least 30% observed, 1 - e^{-R/(L)} ≥ 0.3 → e^{-R/(L)} ≤ 0.7 → R/(L) ≥ ln(1/0.7) → R ≥ L * 0.3567.

So R must be at least about 0.3567 L.

Wait, but in that case, 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 m ≈ 6.73e-7 m, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum R such that the average distance L is R. Because then, the probability of decaying within R would be F(R) = 1 - e^{-1} ≈ 0.632, which is about 63%, but that's more than 30%. But the question says "at least 30%."

Wait, perhaps the proper approach is to find the minimum R such that F(R) = 0.3. So R = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 → R = 0.3567 * L ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, let me check the initial calculation of L again.

E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV.

p² = E² - m² = 27² - 3.41² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719.

p = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.79 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E = 26.79 / 27 ≈0.9922.

Gamma = E/(m c²) → but in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E/m → 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

Tau in lab frame: gamma * tau_0 =7.917 *8e-16 s= 6.3336e-15 s.

Beta c tau =0.9922 *3e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s.

Compute 0.9922 *3e8 =2.9766e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3336e-15 s: 2.9766e8 *6.3336e-15 = (2.9766 *6.3336) * 1e-7.

2.9766 *6 =17.8596.

2.9766 *0.3336 ≈0.9922.

Total is approximately 18.8518.

So 18.8518e-7 m =1.88518e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R= 0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the question is about the proper resolution, which is the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, so that the probability that a decay occurs within that distance is 30%.

Wait, no, because the probability of decaying within R is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.

So if R is the resolution, then F(R) is the fraction observed.

We want F(R) = 0.3 → R = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 L.

So R ≈0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in units where c=1, it's E/m.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma =27/3.41≈7.917.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the distance needed to observe a decay, so the minimum distance is the average decay length, and the fraction is determined based on that.

But I'm not getting any of the option values. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m
B) 2.08e-9 m
C) 2.08e-1 m
D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating L. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I should calculate L more precisely.

Let me compute L = beta * c * tau.

Beta is 26.79 /27 = approximately 0.992222.

Tau is gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 ≈7.91789.

So tau =7.91789 *8e-16 s =63.3431e-16 s =6.3343e-15 s.

So L = beta * c * tau.

Beta = 0.992222.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.992222 *3e8 m/s *6.3343e-15 s.

Let me compute the exponents first: 3e8 *6.3343e-15 = 3 *6.3343 =18.0029, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7.

So 18.0029e-7 m, multiplied by 0.992222:

18.0029e-7 *0.992222 ≈17.903e-7 m, which is 1.7903e-6 m, approximately 1.79e-6 meters.

Wait, that's 1.79 micrometers.

Hmm, so L is approximately 1.79e-6 m.

Now, R =0.3567 * L ≈0.3567 *1.79e-6 ≈ 0.637e-6 m, which is 6.37e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R as the value where F(R) =0.3.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering the velocity and time.

Another approach: the particle's lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0.

The distance it travels before decaying is v tau, which is beta c gamma tau_0.

But another formula: L = c tau * gamma beta.

Wait, yes, because L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Another way to write gamma beta is gamma * beta = (E/m) * (p/E) )= p/(m c^2) * c = not sure.

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps it's better to use L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Because tau is gamma tau_0, and L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, so L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So let me compute that.

beta = p/E = (sqrt(E² - m²))/E.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.01595)= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.9920.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in units where c=1, so gamma = E/m = 27/3.41≈7.917.

So beta gamma ≈0.992 *7.917 ≈7.853.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0 =7.853 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that: 7.853 *3e8 =23.559e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.559e8 *8e-16 = (23.559 *8) *1e-8.

23.559 *8= 188.472.

So 188.472e-8 m =1.88472e-6 m, about 1.885e-6 m.

So L is about 1.885e-6 m, as before.

So back to the problem: R = L * ln(1/0.7)≈1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.72e-7 m.

But options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution R such that the average distance is R. Because the average distance is L, so if the resolution is R, and R is equal to L, then the fraction is about 63%, which is higher than 30%. But the question is about 30%, so R must be less than L.

Wait, but none of the options match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that R is 0.3567 L.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the minimum resolution is the distance that corresponds to 30% of the particles decaying within that distance, which is the value x where F(x)=0.3.

In that case, x= L * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L * ln(1/0.7)= L * 0.3567.

So in that case, x=1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have 6.7e-7 m. The closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average path length, which is L=beta gamma c tau_0, which we have as about 1.885e-6 m. So if the resolution is of the order of that, perhaps the answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 1.885e-6 is close to 2.08e-6, but not exactly. Perhaps the exact calculation gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate everything precisely.

Let's compute beta and gamma accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) = sqrt(729 -11.6281)= sqrt(717.3719)= approximately 26.786 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E =26.786 /27 =0.99207.

Gamma = E/(m c²), but in natural units, c=1, so gamma =27 /3.41=7.9178.

So L=beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L=0.99207 *7.9178 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step.

0.99207 *7.9178 ≈ let's compute that.

0.99207 *7 ≈6.94449.

0.99207 *0.9178≈0.909 (because 0.99207 * 0.9=0.892863, 0.99207*0.0178≈0.0176, total ≈0.9105).

So total ≈6.94449 +0.9105 ≈7.855.

So approx 7.855.

So 7.855 *3e8 =23.565e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.565e8 *8e-16 = (23.565 *8) *1e-8.

23.565 *8=188.52.

So 188.52e-8 m =1.8852e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

So for R, 30% is R=0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed such that the resolution is the same as the average decay length, which would be the case when 63% of decays are within that length.

But the question requires at least 30%, which is a lower threshold. So the required R is smaller than the average decay length.

But the options don't have a value below 1e-6. The smallest option is B) 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because the average decay length is about 1.88 micrometers. So to capture 30% of the decays, the resolution needs to be about 0.67 micrometers, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I messed up the calculations for R.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

The lab frame lifetime is tau= gamma tau_0.

The distance L= beta c tau.

So L= beta c gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed, which is the distance L, but that would correspond to about 63% of decays, not 30%.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance that allows us to see 30% of the decays, so the resolution must be at least R where R= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Which is R= L *0.3567.

But again, that's about 6.7e-7 m.

Wait, maybe the options are using a different approach. Maybe they're using the formula without considering the exponential decay, but just considering the average lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimum distance such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance. So the fraction is 30%, which is F=0.3.

F=1 - e^{-R/L} =0.3 → e^{-R/L}=0.7 → R= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 L.

So as before, R≈0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the minimum resolution is the proper lifetime's path length, i.e., L= beta c tau_0, not considering gamma. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what's intended.

So L= beta c tau_0.

So beta is 0.99207, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

0.99207 *3e8 =2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.9762e8 *8e-16 =23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m.

Which is about 2.38e-7 m, 0.238 micrometers.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, but the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma = E/m =27 /3.41= let's compute that.

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13. So 23.87 is 7 *3.41.

So 27=7*3.41 +3.13.

So 27/3.41=7 +3.13/3.41.

3.13 /3.41 ≈0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0.

Beta=0.99207, gamma=7.9179.

So beta*gamma=0.99207 *7.9179.

Compute:

0.99207 *7=6.94449.

0.99207 *0.9179≈0.910.

So total approx 7.8545.

So L=7.8545 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

7.8545 *3e8=23.5635e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.5635e8 *8e-16 = (23.5635 *8) *1e-8.

23.5635 *8= 188.508.

So 188.508e-8 m =1.88508e-6 m =1.885e-6 m.

So L is 1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R=0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proper lifetime's length, which is beta c tau_0.

Which would be L0= beta c tau_0.

L0=0.99207 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute:

0.99207 *3e8=2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s: 2.9762e8 *8e-16=23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m=0.238 micrometers.

But the options don't have that either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the average lifetime without considering gamma correctly. I'm getting stuck because none of the options match the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the lab frame lifetime as gamma tau_0, but perhaps I should have used the mean decay length as beta gamma c tau_0, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to measure the decay length, which would require the resolution to be at least the same as the decay length. But that would be L=1.885e-6 m, which is not an option. The closest option is A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give a different value. Maybe with more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma and beta more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p²=E² -m²=27^2 -3.41^2=729 - 11.6281=717.3719.

p= sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E =26.786/27=0.992074074.

Gamma = E/m=27/3.41=7.91788856.

So, beta gamma=0.992074074 *7.91788856= let's compute this more accurately.

0.992074074 *7 =6.944518518.

0.992074074 *0.91788856= let's compute 0.992074074 *0.9=0.8928666666 and 0.992074074 *0.01788856≈0.017733.

So total≈0.8928666666 +0.017733≈0.910599.

So beta gamma ≈6.944518518 +0.910599≈7.8551175.

L= beta gamma c tau_0=7.8551175 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.8551175 *3e8=23.5653525e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.5653525e8 *8e-16 = (23.5653525 *8) *1e-8.

23.5653525 *8=188.52282.

So L=188.52282e-8 m=1.8852282e-6 m≈1.885e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.73e-7 m.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to yield 2.08e-6 m. How?

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 1.885e-6 *1.108. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, which is incorrect.

If someone incorrectly uses tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, then L would be beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute:

0.99207 *3e8=2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s:2.9762e8 *8e-16=23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m.

Still not matching 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the mean decay length, which is L= beta gamma c tau_0, and that is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

But that doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option A (2.08e-6) but it's off by about 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate using more precise values.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma exactly.

Beta =26.786 /27= 0.992074074.

Gamma=27 /3.41=7.91788856.

So beta * gamma=0.992074074 *7.91788856.

Compute this precisely:

0.992074074 ×7.91788856.

We can compute this as:

= (0.992074074 ×7) + (0.992074074 ×0.91788856)
=6.944518518 + 0.910598904
=7.855117422.

So L=7.855117422 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.855117422 *3e8=23.56535226e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.56535226e8 *8e-16 = (23.56535226 *8) *1e-8.

23.56535226 *8=188.5228181.

So L=188.5228181e-8 m=1.885228181e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.8852≈0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, and I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with more precise numbers.

Let me compute L precisely.

Using beta gamma=7.855117422.

So L=7.855117422 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.855117422 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.855117422 * (3e8 *8e-16)

=7.855117422 * (24e-8) → 24e-8 is 2.4e-7.

So 7.855117422 *2.4e-7 = ?

7.855117422 ×2.4=18.8522818128.

So 18.8522818128e-7 m=1.88522818128e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6= 0.3567 *1.8852e-6=0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution being the proper lifetime's length, which is beta c tau_0.

So L0= beta c tau_0.

So L0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

=0.99207 *24e-8=23.80968e-8 m=2.380968e-7 m=0.238e-6 m.

Which is 0.238 micrometers.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck here because none of the options match my calculations. However, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. That's about 1.1 times the L I calculated (1.885e-6 m). Perhaps there's a miscalculation or perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, which is L=1.885e-6 m, and the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m, but that's not precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute R=0.3567 * L, which is 6.73e-7 m, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation is done using relativistic gamma incorrectly. For example, if someone forgets to multiply by gamma, they would get L=beta c tau_0, which is 0.238e-6 m, but that's not in the options.

Hmm. I'm not finding any match, but perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and choose the closest option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 1.885e-6 m is 1.885 micrometers, and option A is 2.08 micrometers. The difference is about 10%, which is significant, but perhaps the exact calculation yields 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, let's compute beta more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)=sqrt(729 -11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV/c.

Beta=26.786 /27=0.992074074.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rest frame lifetime, which is incorrect, but leading to a larger L.

If someone uses tau= tau_0, then L=beta c tau_0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16=2.38e-7 m=0.238 micrometers.

But that's not option A.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that the distance is less than the average decay length. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean lifetime and compute the distance as L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is what I did, and that gives 1.885e-6 m.

But the answer isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the minimum resolution is the distance corresponding to 30% of the maximum possible decay length.

Wait, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Since option A is 2.08e-6 m, but my calculation is 1.885e-6 m, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, but I think I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using p=gamma m v, but using units where c=1, perhaps I should have used E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So E in GeV, p in GeV/c.

So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → GeV² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But since c is in m/s, perhaps I should have used E in J, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1.

In natural units, E² =p² +m².

So p= sqrt(E^2 -m^2)= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)= sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV.

Thus, beta = p/(E) =26.786/27=0.99207.

Gamma=E/(m)=27/3.41=7.9178.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=0.99207 *7.9178 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=0.99207 *7.9178=7.8551.

7.8551 *3e8=2.35653e9 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s: 2.35653e9 *8e-16= (2.35653 *8) e-7 =18.85224e-7 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So again, L=1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R=0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.73e-7 m.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the velocity as v=beta c, and then the mean lifetime is gamma tau_0, so the decay length is L= v * gamma tau_0.

Which is same as beta c gamma tau_0, which is what I've been calculating.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I can't see how.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is using the formula for the minimum resolution as the average decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1/(1-0.3)).

Wait, but that's what I did. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't find a way to get 2.08e-6 m from my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done with more precise values, leading to 2.08e-6 m.

Let me compute beta * gamma again with more precise numbers.

Beta =26.786/27=0.99207407407.

Gamma=27/3.41=7.917888563.

So beta*gamma=0.99207407407 *7.917888563= let's compute accurately.

Compute step by step:

0.99207407407 *7=6.94451851849.

0.99207407407 *0.917888563= let's compute:

0.99207407407 *0.9=0.892866666663.

0.99207407407 *0.017888563= approx 0.017733.

So sum is 0.892866666663 + 0.017733=0.9106.

So beta*gamma=6.94451851849 + 0.9106=7.8551185185.

So L=7.8551185185 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.8551185185 *3e8=23.5653555555e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.5653555555e8 *8e-16=188.522844444e-8 m=1.88522844444e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6=6.73e-7 m.

Hmm, still no match.

Perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m. So the calculation must have used a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem considered the lab frame lifetime as tau_0, which would be wrong, but let's see.

If someone incorrectly uses tau= tau_0, then L=beta c tau_0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16=2.38e-7 m=0.238e-6 m=0.238 micrometers.

But that's not an option either.

I'm not seeing any way to get 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in the problem's setup, perhaps using GeV instead of MeV or something, but that's unlikely.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct answer is option A)2.08e-6 m, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the relevant distances.

### Key Information:
- **Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \):** \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \)
- **Energy of \( X^0 \):** \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Mass of \( X^0 \):** \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Speed of light:** \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)) and velocity factor (\( \beta \))
Using the relations:
\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E}, \quad \gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]
where \( p \) is the momentum, calculated as:
\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2}
\]
Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
p = \sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \sqrt{717.3719} \approx 26.79 \, \text{GeV/c}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{26.79}{27} \approx 0.9922, \quad \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (\( L \))
The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:
\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]
Substituting \( \beta = 0.9922 \), \( \gamma = 7.917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9922 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16}.
\]
First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9922 \cdot 7.917 \approx 7.855.
\]
Then:
\[
L = 7.855 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 7.855 \cdot 24 \times 10^{-8} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]
Thus, the mean decay length is approximately \( L \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 3: Determine the minimum resolution (\( R \)) for 30% of decays
The fraction of decays observed within a distance \( R \) is given by the cumulative decay probability:
\[
F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.
\]
To observe at least 30% of the decays (\( F(R) \geq 0.3 \)):
\[
1 - e^{-R/L} \geq 0.3 \implies e^{-R/L} \leq 0.7 \implies -\frac{R}{L} \leq \ln(0.7) \implies R \geq L \cdot \ln(1/0.7).
\]
Using \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.3567 \):
\[
R \geq 0.3567 \cdot L.
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \):
\[
R \geq 0.3567 \cdot 1.885 \approx 0.673 \, \mu\text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution \( R \approx 0.673 \, \mu\text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)** (or \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \)), which is larger than the calculated value. Given the discrepancy, it is assumed that the intended answer is **A**, possibly due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that bubble chambers are used to detect particle tracks, right? The question is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think the key here is to determine the speed of the X⁰ particle because the lifetime is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime dilates due to time dilation. So to find the actual lifetime in the lab frame, I need to multiply tau_0 by gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But to find gamma, maybe it's easier to calculate the beta factor (beta = v/c) first. Beta is equal to the momentum divided by the energy of the particle. Oh wait, in high-energy physics, they often use units where c is 1, so energy (E), momentum (p), and mass (m) are related by E² = p² + m².

Right, so X⁰ has an energy of 27 GeV. Its mass is 3.41 GeV. So the momentum p can be found using E² = p² + m². Let me calculate that.

E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So p² = E² - m² = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2. Let me compute that. 27 squared is 729, and 3.41 squared is approximately 11.6281. So p² is 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719. So p = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.79 GeV/c.

Then, beta is p divided by E. So beta = 26.79 / 27 ≈ 0.9922. So beta is about 0.9922, which makes sense because at high energies, beta approaches 1.

Now, gamma is E / m. Wait, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV, so gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Because gamma is E/m when E is much larger than m, which it is here.

So the dilated lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. Let me compute that. Tau = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate 7.917*8: 8 *7 is 56, 0.917*8≈7.336, so total about 63.336e-16 s, approximately 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait, is that right? Let me check the calculation again. 7.917 * 8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 seconds is 6.3336e-15 seconds. Yeah that seems right.

Now, the particles will move a certain distance before decaying. The distance L is v * tau. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the particles travel further before decaying.

Wait, but v = beta * c. So L = beta * c * tau. So plugging in the numbers, beta is approximately 0.9922, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Tau is 6.3336e-15 s.

So let me compute each part. Beta * c = 0.9922 * 3e8 ≈ 2.9766e8 m/s. Multiply by tau: 2.9766e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Hmm, let me compute 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15. Let's see, 2.9766 *6.3336 is approximately 18.82. Then, 1e8 * 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.82e-7 meters, which is 1.882e-6 meters, or about 1.88 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think I need to find the length that allows us to observe 30% of the decays. Because not all particles will decay along the same path; some will decay earlier, some later.

But wait, in a bubble chamber, the particle moves and decays, and we can see the decay products if the decay vertex is within the chamber's resolution. The resolution is the minimum distance we can distinguish between two points. So if the particle's decay length is L, the fraction of decays that happen within a certain distance depends on the exponential decay law.

The decay follows an exponential probability, so the probability that the decay happens within a distance x is 1 - e^(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length. Wait, no, actually, the decay probability is proportional to (1 - e^(-x/L)). But wait, the probability that the particle decays before traveling a distance x is given by P = 1 - e^(-x/(c tau)), but wait, no, the mean lifetime is tau, so the proper lifetime.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. The proper lifetime is tau_0, but the actual lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0, so the mean path length is L = beta gamma c tau_0. Wait, no, because L = v * tau. v is beta c, tau is gamma tau_0. So L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but we already calculated L as approximately 1.88e-6 meters. So that's the average decay length.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So what does that mean? I think that if the decay occurs within a certain length from the point of origin, we can observe it. So if the resolution is R, we need to have enough decays within R for us to detect at least 30% of them.

Wait, perhaps it's about the decay length. The fraction of the decays that occur within a certain length. For that, the formula is (1 - e^{-x/L}) = 0.3, since 30% is 0.3 in decimal.

Wait, because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the cumulative distribution function is F(x) = 1 - e^{-x/L}, where x is the decay distance. So we need F(x) >= 0.3.

Wait, no. Since the particle decays with probability proportional to the time, the fraction that decay before x is F(x) = 1 - e^{-x/(L)}. Because the average distance is L. So if we set F(x) = 0.3, then 1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 → e^{-x/L} = 0.7 → -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = -L ln(0.7).

Wait, wait, ln(0.7) is negative. So x = L * ln(1/0.7) = L * ln(10/7) ≈ L * 0.35667.

So x ≈ 0.35667 * L.

But wait, I'm trying to find the minimum x such that at least 30% of the particles decay within x. So F(x) >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-x/L} >= 0.3 → x >= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x >= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So the length we need is about 35.67% of the mean decay length. So the minimum x required is 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but wait, no: the mean decay length is L. So to capture at least 30% of the decays, we can compute x such that F(x) = 0.3. So x ≈ L * ln(1/(1 - 0.3)) → x = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So the minimum x is approximately 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but if the question is about the minimum resolution, perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish two decay points. So if the average decay length is L, but the resolution is R, then we need R to be such that a significant fraction (30%) of the particles decay within R, so that we can detect them. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution is the maximum distance over which the decay is observed. So if the decay occurs beyond the resolution, we can't see it. So to capture 30% of the decays, the resolution should be R >= x, where x is the point where 30% of the decays have happened by that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the minimum resolution is the minimum distance that allows us to observe the decay, and we need to find the length x where 30% of the decays have occurred by that point, which is the x we calculated.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution, which I think is the minimum distance that allows detection of at least 30% of the decays. So if the resolution is R, then the fraction of decays observed is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}. We want F(R) ≥ 0.3.

So solving for R:

1 - e^{-R/L} ≥ 0.3 → e^{-R/L} ≤ 0.7 → -R/L ≤ ln(0.7) → R ≥ L * ln(0.7^{-1}) → R ≥ L * ln(1/0.7) → R ≥ L * 0.3567.

So the minimum resolution is R = 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the mean decay length is L. So if the resolution R is the maximum distance you can resolve, then the fraction of decays observed is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.

We want F(R) ≥ 0.3 → R ≥ L * ln(1/ (1-0.3)) → R ≥ L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L.

But wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So the resolution must be at least R, where R is the value we just calculated, 0.3567 L.

But wait, that would mean R is about 35% of L. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the minimum distance such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. So if the average distance is L, then 30% occurs within x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x ≈ 0.3567 L.

So the minimum resolution needed is R ≈ 0.3567 L.

But wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the smallest R such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, R must be such that the probability of a decay occurring within R is 30%, which is 0.3.

So, the formula is F(R) = 1 - e^{- R / L} = 0.3.

So, R = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) ) → R = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So R ≈ 0.3567 * L.

Wait, but I had L as approximately 1.88e-6 meters. So R would be 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 m ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 meters or 0.67 micrometers.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, none of the options are around 6e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I compute L correctly? Let me double-check the numbers.

E = 27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p² = E² - m² = 27² - 3.41² → 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 → p ≈ sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.79 GeV/c.

So beta = p/E = 26.79 / 27 ≈ 0.9922.

Gamma = E / m = 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.917.

So the lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = 63.336e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Then, L = beta c tau = 0.9922 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.9922 * 3e8 = 2.9766e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3336e-15 s: 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.9766e8 * 6.3336e-15.

First, multiply the coefficients: 2.9766 * 6.3336 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.9766 * 6 = 17.8596
2.9766 * 0.3336 ≈ 0.9922 (since 2.9766 * 0.333 is approx 0.992)
So total ≈ 17.8596 + 0.9922 ≈ 18.8518.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-15 = 1e-7.

So 18.8518e-7 m = 1.88518e-6 meters, approximately 1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers.

So L ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

So R = 0.3567 * L ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885 ≈ 0.673e-6 m, which is 6.73e-7 m, or 0.673 micrometers.

But looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), option D is 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), which is way bigger. Hmm, none of the options match 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution (like the minimum distance that can be resolved) such that 30% of the decays are observed. If the resolution is R, then the fraction observed is 1 - e^{-R/(L)}. So to have at least 30% observed, 1 - e^{-R/(L)} ≥ 0.3 → e^{-R/(L)} ≤ 0.7 → R/(L) ≥ ln(1/0.7) → R ≥ L * 0.3567.

So R must be at least about 0.3567 L.

Wait, but in that case, 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 m ≈ 6.73e-7 m, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum R such that the average distance L is R. Because then, the probability of decaying within R would be F(R) = 1 - e^{-1} ≈ 0.632, which is about 63%, but that's more than 30%. But the question says "at least 30%."

Wait, perhaps the proper approach is to find the minimum R such that F(R) = 0.3. So R = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 → R = 0.3567 * L ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, let me check the initial calculation of L again.

E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV.

p² = E² - m² = 27² - 3.41² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719.

p = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.79 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E = 26.79 / 27 ≈0.9922.

Gamma = E/(m c²) → but in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E/m → 27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

Tau in lab frame: gamma * tau_0 =7.917 *8e-16 s= 6.3336e-15 s.

Beta c tau =0.9922 *3e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s.

Compute 0.9922 *3e8 =2.9766e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3336e-15 s: 2.9766e8 *6.3336e-15 = (2.9766 *6.3336) * 1e-7.

2.9766 *6 =17.8596.

2.9766 *0.3336 ≈0.9922.

Total is approximately 18.8518.

So 18.8518e-7 m =1.88518e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R= 0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the question is about the proper resolution, which is the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, so that the probability that a decay occurs within that distance is 30%.

Wait, no, because the probability of decaying within R is F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.

So if R is the resolution, then F(R) is the fraction observed.

We want F(R) = 0.3 → R = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 L.

So R ≈0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in units where c=1, it's E/m.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma =27/3.41≈7.917.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the distance needed to observe a decay, so the minimum distance is the average decay length, and the fraction is determined based on that.

But I'm not getting any of the option values. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m
B) 2.08e-9 m
C) 2.08e-1 m
D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating L. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I should calculate L more precisely.

Let me compute L = beta * c * tau.

Beta is 26.79 /27 = approximately 0.992222.

Tau is gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 ≈7.91789.

So tau =7.91789 *8e-16 s =63.3431e-16 s =6.3343e-15 s.

So L = beta * c * tau.

Beta = 0.992222.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.992222 *3e8 m/s *6.3343e-15 s.

Let me compute the exponents first: 3e8 *6.3343e-15 = 3 *6.3343 =18.0029, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7.

So 18.0029e-7 m, multiplied by 0.992222:

18.0029e-7 *0.992222 ≈17.903e-7 m, which is 1.7903e-6 m, approximately 1.79e-6 meters.

Wait, that's 1.79 micrometers.

Hmm, so L is approximately 1.79e-6 m.

Now, R =0.3567 * L ≈0.3567 *1.79e-6 ≈ 0.637e-6 m, which is 6.37e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R as the value where F(R) =0.3.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering the velocity and time.

Another approach: the particle's lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0.

The distance it travels before decaying is v tau, which is beta c gamma tau_0.

But another formula: L = c tau * gamma beta.

Wait, yes, because L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Another way to write gamma beta is gamma * beta = (E/m) * (p/E) )= p/(m c^2) * c = not sure.

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps it's better to use L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Because tau is gamma tau_0, and L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, so L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So let me compute that.

beta = p/E = (sqrt(E² - m²))/E.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.01595)= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.9920.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in units where c=1, so gamma = E/m = 27/3.41≈7.917.

So beta gamma ≈0.992 *7.917 ≈7.853.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0 =7.853 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that: 7.853 *3e8 =23.559e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.559e8 *8e-16 = (23.559 *8) *1e-8.

23.559 *8= 188.472.

So 188.472e-8 m =1.88472e-6 m, about 1.885e-6 m.

So L is about 1.885e-6 m, as before.

So back to the problem: R = L * ln(1/0.7)≈1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.72e-7 m.

But options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution R such that the average distance is R. Because the average distance is L, so if the resolution is R, and R is equal to L, then the fraction is about 63%, which is higher than 30%. But the question is about 30%, so R must be less than L.

Wait, but none of the options match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that R is 0.3567 L.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the minimum resolution is the distance that corresponds to 30% of the particles decaying within that distance, which is the value x where F(x)=0.3.

In that case, x= L * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L * ln(1/0.7)= L * 0.3567.

So in that case, x=1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have 6.7e-7 m. The closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average path length, which is L=beta gamma c tau_0, which we have as about 1.885e-6 m. So if the resolution is of the order of that, perhaps the answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 1.885e-6 is close to 2.08e-6, but not exactly. Perhaps the exact calculation gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate everything precisely.

Let's compute beta and gamma accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) = sqrt(729 -11.6281)= sqrt(717.3719)= approximately 26.786 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E =26.786 /27 =0.99207.

Gamma = E/(m c²), but in natural units, c=1, so gamma =27 /3.41=7.9178.

So L=beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L=0.99207 *7.9178 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step.

0.99207 *7.9178 ≈ let's compute that.

0.99207 *7 ≈6.94449.

0.99207 *0.9178≈0.909 (because 0.99207 * 0.9=0.892863, 0.99207*0.0178≈0.0176, total ≈0.9105).

So total ≈6.94449 +0.9105 ≈7.855.

So approx 7.855.

So 7.855 *3e8 =23.565e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.565e8 *8e-16 = (23.565 *8) *1e-8.

23.565 *8=188.52.

So 188.52e-8 m =1.8852e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

So for R, 30% is R=0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed such that the resolution is the same as the average decay length, which would be the case when 63% of decays are within that length.

But the question requires at least 30%, which is a lower threshold. So the required R is smaller than the average decay length.

But the options don't have a value below 1e-6. The smallest option is B) 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because the average decay length is about 1.88 micrometers. So to capture 30% of the decays, the resolution needs to be about 0.67 micrometers, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I messed up the calculations for R.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

The lab frame lifetime is tau= gamma tau_0.

The distance L= beta c tau.

So L= beta c gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed, which is the distance L, but that would correspond to about 63% of decays, not 30%.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance that allows us to see 30% of the decays, so the resolution must be at least R where R= L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Which is R= L *0.3567.

But again, that's about 6.7e-7 m.

Wait, maybe the options are using a different approach. Maybe they're using the formula without considering the exponential decay, but just considering the average lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimum distance such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance. So the fraction is 30%, which is F=0.3.

F=1 - e^{-R/L} =0.3 → e^{-R/L}=0.7 → R= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 L.

So as before, R≈0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the minimum resolution is the proper lifetime's path length, i.e., L= beta c tau_0, not considering gamma. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what's intended.

So L= beta c tau_0.

So beta is 0.99207, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

0.99207 *3e8 =2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.9762e8 *8e-16 =23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m.

Which is about 2.38e-7 m, 0.238 micrometers.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, but the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma = E/m =27 /3.41= let's compute that.

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13. So 23.87 is 7 *3.41.

So 27=7*3.41 +3.13.

So 27/3.41=7 +3.13/3.41.

3.13 /3.41 ≈0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0.

Beta=0.99207, gamma=7.9179.

So beta*gamma=0.99207 *7.9179.

Compute:

0.99207 *7=6.94449.

0.99207 *0.9179≈0.910.

So total approx 7.8545.

So L=7.8545 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

7.8545 *3e8=23.5635e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.5635e8 *8e-16 = (23.5635 *8) *1e-8.

23.5635 *8= 188.508.

So 188.508e-8 m =1.88508e-6 m =1.885e-6 m.

So L is 1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R=0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proper lifetime's length, which is beta c tau_0.

Which would be L0= beta c tau_0.

L0=0.99207 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute:

0.99207 *3e8=2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s: 2.9762e8 *8e-16=23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m=0.238 micrometers.

But the options don't have that either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the average lifetime without considering gamma correctly. I'm getting stuck because none of the options match the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the lab frame lifetime as gamma tau_0, but perhaps I should have used the mean decay length as beta gamma c tau_0, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to measure the decay length, which would require the resolution to be at least the same as the decay length. But that would be L=1.885e-6 m, which is not an option. The closest option is A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give a different value. Maybe with more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma and beta more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p²=E² -m²=27^2 -3.41^2=729 - 11.6281=717.3719.

p= sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV/c.

Beta = p/E =26.786/27=0.992074074.

Gamma = E/m=27/3.41=7.91788856.

So, beta gamma=0.992074074 *7.91788856= let's compute this more accurately.

0.992074074 *7 =6.944518518.

0.992074074 *0.91788856= let's compute 0.992074074 *0.9=0.8928666666 and 0.992074074 *0.01788856≈0.017733.

So total≈0.8928666666 +0.017733≈0.910599.

So beta gamma ≈6.944518518 +0.910599≈7.8551175.

L= beta gamma c tau_0=7.8551175 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.8551175 *3e8=23.5653525e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.5653525e8 *8e-16 = (23.5653525 *8) *1e-8.

23.5653525 *8=188.52282.

So L=188.52282e-8 m=1.8852282e-6 m≈1.885e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.885e-6≈6.73e-7 m.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to yield 2.08e-6 m. How?

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 1.885e-6 *1.108. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, which is incorrect.

If someone incorrectly uses tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, then L would be beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute:

0.99207 *3e8=2.9762e8 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s:2.9762e8 *8e-16=23.8096e-8 m=2.38096e-7 m.

Still not matching 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the mean decay length, which is L= beta gamma c tau_0, and that is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

But that doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option A (2.08e-6) but it's off by about 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate using more precise values.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma exactly.

Beta =26.786 /27= 0.992074074.

Gamma=27 /3.41=7.91788856.

So beta * gamma=0.992074074 *7.91788856.

Compute this precisely:

0.992074074 ×7.91788856.

We can compute this as:

= (0.992074074 ×7) + (0.992074074 ×0.91788856)
=6.944518518 + 0.910598904
=7.855117422.

So L=7.855117422 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.855117422 *3e8=23.56535226e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.56535226e8 *8e-16 = (23.56535226 *8) *1e-8.

23.56535226 *8=188.5228181.

So L=188.5228181e-8 m=1.885228181e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.8852≈0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, and I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with more precise numbers.

Let me compute L precisely.

Using beta gamma=7.855117422.

So L=7.855117422 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.855117422 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.855117422 * (3e8 *8e-16)

=7.855117422 * (24e-8) → 24e-8 is 2.4e-7.

So 7.855117422 *2.4e-7 = ?

7.855117422 ×2.4=18.8522818128.

So 18.8522818128e-7 m=1.88522818128e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6= 0.3567 *1.8852e-6=0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution being the proper lifetime's length, which is beta c tau_0.

So L0= beta c tau_0.

So L0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

=0.99207 *24e-8=23.80968e-8 m=2.380968e-7 m=0.238e-6 m.

Which is 0.238 micrometers.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck here because none of the options match my calculations. However, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. That's about 1.1 times the L I calculated (1.885e-6 m). Perhaps there's a miscalculation or perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, which is L=1.885e-6 m, and the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m, but that's not precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute R=0.3567 * L, which is 6.73e-7 m, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation is done using relativistic gamma incorrectly. For example, if someone forgets to multiply by gamma, they would get L=beta c tau_0, which is 0.238e-6 m, but that's not in the options.

Hmm. I'm not finding any match, but perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and choose the closest option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 1.885e-6 m is 1.885 micrometers, and option A is 2.08 micrometers. The difference is about 10%, which is significant, but perhaps the exact calculation yields 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, let's compute beta more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

p= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)=sqrt(729 -11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV/c.

Beta=26.786 /27=0.992074074.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rest frame lifetime, which is incorrect, but leading to a larger L.

If someone uses tau= tau_0, then L=beta c tau_0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16=2.38e-7 m=0.238 micrometers.

But that's not option A.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that the distance is less than the average decay length. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean lifetime and compute the distance as L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is what I did, and that gives 1.885e-6 m.

But the answer isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the minimum resolution is the distance corresponding to 30% of the maximum possible decay length.

Wait, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Since option A is 2.08e-6 m, but my calculation is 1.885e-6 m, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, but I think I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using p=gamma m v, but using units where c=1, perhaps I should have used E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So E in GeV, p in GeV/c.

So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → GeV² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But since c is in m/s, perhaps I should have used E in J, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1.

In natural units, E² =p² +m².

So p= sqrt(E^2 -m^2)= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)= sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV.

Thus, beta = p/(E) =26.786/27=0.99207.

Gamma=E/(m)=27/3.41=7.9178.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=0.99207 *7.9178 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=0.99207 *7.9178=7.8551.

7.8551 *3e8=2.35653e9 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s: 2.35653e9 *8e-16= (2.35653 *8) e-7 =18.85224e-7 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So again, L=1.885e-6 m.

Thus, R=0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.73e-7 m.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the velocity as v=beta c, and then the mean lifetime is gamma tau_0, so the decay length is L= v * gamma tau_0.

Which is same as beta c gamma tau_0, which is what I've been calculating.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I can't see how.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is using the formula for the minimum resolution as the average decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1/(1-0.3)).

Wait, but that's what I did. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't find a way to get 2.08e-6 m from my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done with more precise values, leading to 2.08e-6 m.

Let me compute beta * gamma again with more precise numbers.

Beta =26.786/27=0.99207407407.

Gamma=27/3.41=7.917888563.

So beta*gamma=0.99207407407 *7.917888563= let's compute accurately.

Compute step by step:

0.99207407407 *7=6.94451851849.

0.99207407407 *0.917888563= let's compute:

0.99207407407 *0.9=0.892866666663.

0.99207407407 *0.017888563= approx 0.017733.

So sum is 0.892866666663 + 0.017733=0.9106.

So beta*gamma=6.94451851849 + 0.9106=7.8551185185.

So L=7.8551185185 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.8551185185 *3e8=23.5653555555e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:23.5653555555e8 *8e-16=188.522844444e-8 m=1.88522844444e-6 m=1.8852e-6 m.

So R=0.3567 *1.8852e-6=6.73e-7 m.

Hmm, still no match.

Perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m. So the calculation must have used a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem considered the lab frame lifetime as tau_0, which would be wrong, but let's see.

If someone incorrectly uses tau= tau_0, then L=beta c tau_0=0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16=2.38e-7 m=0.238e-6 m=0.238 micrometers.

But that's not an option either.

I'm not seeing any way to get 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in the problem's setup, perhaps using GeV instead of MeV or something, but that's unlikely.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct answer is option A)2.08e-6 m, but I'm not entirely sure.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the relevant distances.

### Key Information:
- **Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \):** \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \)
- **Energy of \( X^0 \):** \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Mass of \( X^0 \):** \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Speed of light:** \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)) and velocity factor (\( \beta \))
Using the relations:
\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E}, \quad \gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]
where \( p \) is the momentum, calculated as:
\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2}
\]
Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
p = \sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \sqrt{717.3719} \approx 26.79 \, \text{GeV/c}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{26.79}{27} \approx 0.9922, \quad \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (\( L \))
The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by:
\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]
Substituting \( \beta = 0.9922 \), \( \gamma = 7.917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9922 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16}.
\]
First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9922 \cdot 7.917 \approx 7.855.
\]
Then:
\[
L = 7.855 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 7.855 \cdot 24 \times 10^{-8} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]
Thus, the mean decay length is approximately \( L \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 3: Determine the minimum resolution (\( R \)) for 30% of decays
The fraction of decays observed within a distance \( R \) is given by the cumulative decay probability:
\[
F(R) = 1 - e^{-R/L}.
\]
To observe at least 30% of the decays (\( F(R) \geq 0.3 \)):
\[
1 - e^{-R/L} \geq 0.3 \implies e^{-R/L} \leq 0.7 \implies -\frac{R}{L} \leq \ln(0.7) \implies R \geq L \cdot \ln(1/0.7).
\]
Using \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.3567 \):
\[
R \geq 0.3567 \cdot L.
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \):
\[
R \geq 0.3567 \cdot 1.885 \approx 0.673 \, \mu\text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution \( R \approx 0.673 \, \mu\text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)** (or \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \)), which is larger than the calculated value. Given the discrepancy, it is assumed that the intended answer is **A**, possibly due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
