Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. It also mentions small values of m, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. The transition energy ΔE is from hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is like the Zeeman effect term) with ΔE.

Wait, so the main idea here is about the relative magnitudes of two energy terms. One is the Zeeman energy from the magnetic field, and the other is the energy difference corresponding to that wavelength. I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen have certain transitions, like the Balmer series, where the wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is the Balmer-alpha line. So ΔE corresponds to that transition.

First, I should probably find ΔE using the wavelength given. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So plugging in the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is about 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives roughly 4.087e-19 J. Hmm, that's the energy of a photon at that wavelength.

But wait, this E is the transition energy ΔE between two energy levels in hydrogen. So the ΔE is about 4e-19 J.

Next, I need to find the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Zeeman energy. The Zeeman term is given by H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for electrons). But wait, since the problem is about the orbital magnetic quantum number m, perhaps the relevant term is the orbital contribution. Oh, wait, in the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is H' = -μ_B m B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field would be ΔE_magnetic = μ_B * m * B. But wait, the problem says m is small, so m is probably about 1 or maybe 0 or ±1, since it's small. Wait, but the orbital quantum number l can be up to certain values, but m is the z-component, so for a given l, m can be from -l to +l. But the problem says small m, so maybe m=0 or m=±1. But regardless, the term would be proportional to m. But since m is a quantum number, it's an integer, so even if it's 1, the product would be significant.

But wait, the exact expression for the Zeeman energy is H' = μ_B * m * B. So the energy shift would be proportional to m. But m can be from -l to +l. For hydrogen, the energy levels have different l values. For example, the ground state is l=0, so m=0. Then the first excited state has l=1, m= -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term would be H' = μ_B * B * m. So for m=1, H' is μ_B * B. Let's compute that. μ_B is ~9.27e-24 J/T, B is 1 T. So H' = 9.27e-24 J.

So the paramagnetic term is about 9e-24 J, and the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-19 J. Comparing them, 9e-24 is much smaller than 4e-19. So the magnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait! I think I might have missed a factor here. Because in the hydrogen atom, the actual energy levels have much larger energies than the Zeeman shifts. The energy levels of hydrogen are on the order of eV. For example, the ground state is about -13.6 eV, which is roughly -2.18e-18 J. Because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 13.6 eV is about 2.18e-18 J, but ΔE would be a portion of that. Wait, but the transition energy I calculated earlier was about 4e-19 J, which is smaller than the energy levels but perhaps larger than the Zeeman shift.

Wait, let me compute ΔE as 4e-19 J. The paramagnetic term H' is 9.27e-24 J. So comparing H' to ΔE, H' is about 4e-19 / 9e-24 = approximately 444,444 times smaller. So H' is way smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy.

Wait, but the question is asking about the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term relative to the transition energy. So H' is much less than ΔE. So in the options, which one says that the average H is much less than ΔE?

Looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → same magnitude, not likely.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → H bigger, not the case.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → H is much smaller, which seems correct.

D) ⟨H⟩> ΔE → H larger, which is not the case.

So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE." So are we comparing the paramagnetic term H' to the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, which is ΔE? So yeah, H' is much less than ΔE.

So the answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two energy scales:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the relation:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   Here, \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.087 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (⟨H⟩):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect, where the energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B
   \]  
   Here, \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, e.g., \( m = \pm 1 \)), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For \( m = \pm 1 \):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   Comparing the two energy scales:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.087 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.266 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 22,660 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

4. **Analysis of Options:**  
   - **A) \( \langle H \rangle = \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the magnitudes are not comparable.  
   - **B) \( \langle H \rangle \gg \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the paramagnetic term is much smaller.  
   - **C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \):** Correct, as shown by the calculation.  
   - **D) \( \langle H \rangle > \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the paramagnetic term is smaller.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.

So plugging in the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is about 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives roughly 4.087e-19 J. Hmm, that's the energy of a photon at that wavelength.

So the paramagnetic term is about 9e-24 J, and the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-19 J. Comparing them, 9e-24 is much smaller than 4e-19. So the magnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait! I think I might have missed a factor here. Because in the hydrogen atom, the actual energy levels have much larger energies than the Zeeman shifts.

   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (⟨H⟩):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect, where the energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B

   Here, \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, e.g., \( m = \pm 1 \)), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For \( m = \pm 1 \):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.

3. **Comparison:**  
   Comparing the two energy scales:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.087 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.266 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 22,660 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

4. **Analysis of Options:**  
   - **A) \( \langle H \rangle = \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the magnitudes are not comparable.  
   - **B) \( \langle H \rangle \gg \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the paramagnetic term is much smaller.  
   - **C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \):** Correct, as shown by the calculation.  
   - **D) \( \langle H \rangle > \Delta E \):** Incorrect, as the paramagnetic term is smaller.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.
