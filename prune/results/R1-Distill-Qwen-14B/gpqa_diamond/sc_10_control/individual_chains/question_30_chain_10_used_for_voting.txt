Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a textile dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between molecular orbitals. So, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the transition between these orbitals.

Oh right, the energy of the emitted light is the same as the energy gap, but wait no— when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. Then, when it emits light, it's usually at a slightly lower energy because of possible losses, but in this case, I think the question is considering the energy of the absorbed photon as the same as the energy of the emitted photon. Or maybe not. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy of the absorbed photon minus any losses, but for simplicity in these problems, they often equate the two. So if the molecule emits light at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference (the band gap) between the excited state and the ground state. So the molecule must have absorbed a photon of that energy to get excited.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs light, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher energy state (excited). Then, when it relaxes back, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference between the ground and excited states. The emitted photon's energy is the same as that energy difference (if there's no loss), but sometimes there's a difference because of other factors. But I think for this problem, we can assume that the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the emitted.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, that's the energy that causes the transition. Then, when it emits, it might emit a photon of lower energy. But sometimes, in fluorescence, the emitted photon can be lower energy than the absorbed. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, gets excited, and then emits a photon of lower energy as it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the emitted photon's energy is the energy gap between the excited state and the lower state it relaxes to. Or perhaps it's the same as the energy of the absorbed photon minus some energy loss.

But in this problem, the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which means that the energy gap is 2.3393 eV. So the molecule absorbed a photon of that energy.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the energy of the emitted light is the energy of the photon that the molecule emits when it relaxes. So the energy of the photon emitted would be the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the emitted photon's energy, assuming no other energy losses. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you absorb a photon and then emit one with the same energy, you're not really doing anything. That's probably not the case.

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Let me correct this. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state the molecule relaxes to. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground state to a higher energy state (excited state). Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon. The emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited state and the state it's relaxing to.

Wait, but in many cases, the molecule might emit a photon when it drops from the excited state to a lower state, not necessarily all the way to the ground state. But in the simplest case, let's assume it's the ground state.

So the energy of the photon emitted is the same as the energy of the photon absorbed. Wait, but that can't be right because the energy of the emitted photon would be lower than the absorbed if there's a difference in the states. For example, if you absorb a higher energy photon and then emit a lower energy one due to some energy loss.

Alternatively, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the transition from the excited state to the ground state, which is the same as the energy of the photon absorbed. So in that case, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon.

Wait, but that would imply that the molecule absorbed and emitted the same energy, which doesn't change anything. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another way: the energy of the light emitted is the energy gap between the excited state and the next lower state. The absorbed photon's energy is the gap between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted photon, perhaps.

But I'm not sure. Let's think in terms of colors. The energy of the photon is inversely related to the wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths, which correspond to higher frequency and colors on the blue end of the spectrum. Lower energy photons are longer wavelengths, red end.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, what color is that? Let me calculate the wavelength.

The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and E is in Joules.

So λ = hc/E.

But E is given in eV. To convert eV to Joules, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.747e-19 J.

λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.747e-19 J.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.747e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 ≈ 5.306e-7 meters.

5.306e-7 meters is 530.6 nanometers.

530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the options given are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Hmm, none of the options are green. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check.

Wait, 530 nm is green. But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green light, then the color it absorbed is... Well, when something emits a certain color, it's because it absorbed the complementary color.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The color we see is what's emitted. The absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. Wait, maybe the confusion is whether the emitted light is the same as the absorbed. Let me think again.

Wait, the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So the molecule is absorbing a photon of that energy, causing it to emit green. But that would mean it absorbs green and emits green? That doesn't make sense because then it wouldn't change color. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no, another approach: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's typically in the UV or visible range. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between the molecule's orbitals. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed photon, but perhaps it's the same. Wait, no, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of what color is absorbed to cause the emission. So when a dye emits green light, it probably absorbed a higher energy (lower wavelength) photon, perhaps blue or violet. Let me think about the energy levels.

If the emission is at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy because the molecule goes from ground state to excited state upon absorbing.

So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted photon. Because during fluorescence, the molecule emits a photon of lower energy than the one absorbed. So if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed photon would be higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

Wait, but let me compute the energy again. 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So, if the absorbed photon is higher energy than 2.3393 eV, it would be a shorter wavelength (higher frequency). What color is that?

The visible spectrum goes roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So a photon with energy higher than 2.3393 eV (which is 530 nm or green) would have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. So possible colors are blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (around 380-450 nm).

But the question is asking what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon would be in the violet or blue range, because those have higher energy than green.

Wait, but wait: the question says the compound emits 2.3393 eV, which is green, so it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (blue or violet). So the compound absorbs that higher energy photon, and then emits lower energy (green) photon. So the absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted.

So the options are A) Red (longer wavelength, lower energy), which is 620-750 nm, so lower than 530. So that's not. B) Violet is 380-450. C) Blue is 450-495. D) Yellow is 570-590. Wait, which is longer than green.

Wait, wait. Let me correct the visible spectrum ranges.

Violet: ~380-450 nm

Blue: ~450-495 nm

Green: ~495-570 nm

Yellow: ~570-590 nm

Orange: ~590-620 nm

Red: ~620-750 nm

So, 530 nm is in the green range.

So if the dye emits green (530 nm, 2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher energy. Higher energy than 2.3393 eV would be shorter wavelength than 530 nm, so either violet or blue.

So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Wait, but which one? So what's the energy corresponding to violet and blue?

Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Violet light, say 400 nm: E = (1240 eV·nm)/400 nm = 3.1 eV.

Blue light, say 450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than both blue and violet. So the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue or violet.

But wait, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that. Hence, the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But looking at the options, B is Violet and C is Blue. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question says the compound absorbs the light. So the absorbed photon must be the energy that causes the transition. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

So the question is, what color is absorbed? It could be violet or blue, but which one?

Wait, maybe I should think about the complement. Wait, the color we see is the color that's transmitted or emitted. So if the compound emits green (530 nm), then the color absorbed is the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and violet. But magenta isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed color is the one at 2.3393 eV. But that would be green, which is not in the options. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the energy of the absorbed photon. The question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the energy gap between the ground and excited states. So the absorbed photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher, like blue or violet.

But how do I decide between blue and violet? Let's think about the energy. The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV.

If the absorbed photon's energy is higher, say 2.75 eV (which is blue), then the emitted photon is 2.339 eV.

So the absorbed photon's energy is 2.75 eV, which is blue. Therefore, the compound absorbs blue light, and emits green.

But wait, another thought: the energy emitted could be the energy difference between the initial and final states when the molecule relaxes. So the absorbed photon could be higher in energy than the emitted.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the wavelengths.

E=hc/lambda, so higher energy means shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm (green). So possible colors are violet (400-450 nm) or blue (450-495). So the energies would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

If the absorbed photon is violet, which is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than blue, then the energy would be higher than blue.

Wait, but blue is at around 450 nm, which is higher energy than green. Violet is at 400, which is higher than blue.

So the energy of a violet photon is higher than that of a blue photon, which in turn is higher than green.

So if the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher, either blue or violet.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed photon being equal to the energy of the emitted photon. But that would make no sense because the molecule would emit the same energy it absorbed, which wouldn't cause a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon must match that energy. So the absorbed photon would be 2.3393 eV, which is green. But since green isn't an option, I'm confused.

Wait, the options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength.

Wait, let's compute the wavelength again. E = 2.3393 eV.

So E in Joules: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.747e-19 J.

Now, c = 3e8 m/s.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = h c / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.747e-19.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator: 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 = 5.306e-7 m = 530.6e-9 m = 530.6 nm.

Yes, that's correct. So 530 nm is green. So the emitted light is green.

So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than green, which is either blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which one is correct? Well, the energy of blue is about 2.75 eV (at 450 nm), and violet is higher, around 3.1 eV (at 400 nm).

So the question is, which of these is the color absorbed. But the question states that the compound emits at 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. But without more info, how do we choose?

Wait, another angle: the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the emitted photon would be of lower energy (longer wavelength), meaning red, orange, etc.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap. Lower energy gaps mean that the energy required to excite the electron is less. So lower energy photons (longer wavelength, like red) are absorbed.

Wait, but wait: the energy of the photon corresponds to the energy gap. If the gap is small, a lower energy photon (longer wavelength) is needed. So for a molecule with a large conjugated pi system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is of lower energy, longer wavelength (like red).

But in this case, the molecule is emitting light at 2.3393 eV (green). So if the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, the conjugated system must be such that it requires that energy. Hmm, but that's a relatively large energy gap. Maybe for something with a moderately conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the question.

The question is, what color is absorbed? The molecule emits 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

Which option is higher than 2.3393 eV? Let's compute their energies.

Compute energy for each option:

A) Red: Let's take 650 nm (red is around 620-750 nm). E = 1240 / 650 ≈ 1.907 eV. Lower than 2.3393 eV. So if the emitted is 2.339, red would be lower than that, so can't be absorbed.

B) Violet: Let's take 400 nm. E = 1240 /400 = 3.1 eV. Higher than 2.3393 eV. So possible.

C) Blue: 450 nm. E=1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Higher than 2.3393 eV. Also possible.

D) Yellow: 580 nm. E=1240/580 ≈ 2.138 eV. Lower than 2.3393. So not possible.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue).

But which one is more likely? Hmm.

Wait, the question states that the compound emits light upon absorbing. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy difference between the excited state and ground state. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.75 eV).

But without knowing the exact energy gap, perhaps we can think about the position. The compound emits green, so it's absorbing either blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: in many dyes, the color absorbed is the complementary color of what they emit. So, if a dye emits green, the color it absorbs is magenta (which is a combination of red and blue/violet). But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the closest option is violet or blue.

But the options are B and C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up approximate energy levels for common dyes.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap between the orbitals. So if the molecule emits green, that would correspond to the energy difference between the states. So the absorbed photon would have the same energy as the emitted, but that doesn't make sense for absorption because you need higher energy to get excited.

Wait, no, that can't be. Absorption requires that the photon's energy matches the energy needed to promote an electron from a lower to a higher energy level. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference between these levels. The emitted photon's energy is the energy difference when the electron returns to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon only in the case where the molecule goes directly from the ground state to the excited state, and then back. But in reality, after excitation, the molecule might lose some energy (like through vibrations or other transitions) before emitting the photon. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed must be higher than that.

So the possible colors are blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So, which is more likely? The question says the compound is a textile dye. Dyes often absorb in the visible range, and emit in the visible range as well. For example, many dyes absorb in the UV or blue/violet and emit in the visible (like green, yellow, red).

So, if the dye emits green, it might be absorbing blue or violet.

But without more specific info, it's a bit tricky. However, blue has a lower energy than violet. Let's compute the energy for 2.3393 eV and see if it's in the blue or violet region.

Wait, 2.3393 eV corresponds to 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher, so either blue (450 nm: 2.756 eV) or violet (400 nm: 3.1 eV).

But the question is about which color is absorbed. So among the options, B is Violet and C is Blue.

So which one has energy higher than 2.3393 eV?

Violet is higher, as 3.1 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. Blue is 2.756 eV, which is also higher than 2.3393 eV.

So both B and C are possible.

Wait, but maybe the energy of 2.3393 eV is the energy of the absorbed photon. Then the emitted photon would be lower. But that can't be because the question says the dye emits that light upon absorbing.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy gap. So the absorption must be at that same energy.

But that would mean the compound absorbs green light, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the colors and their energies.

Green is 2.3393 eV.

Blue is about 2.75 eV.

Violet is about 3.1 eV.

So, if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed either blue or violet. But which is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy required for the transition is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be of that energy. But then, since green isn't an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is the energy of the transition. So the molecule absorbed a photon of that energy. So the color absorbed is green. But since the options don't include green, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength calculation.

Wait, let me compute the wavelength using E = 1240 / lambda (in nm) eV.

So E = 2.3393 eV = 1240 / lambda.

So lambda = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm.

Yes, right. So 530 nm is green.

So if the compound emits green, it absorbed a photon of higher energy. So either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is blue, but why?

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical colors absorbed by dyes that emit green. For example, some dyes absorb blue and emit green. Because blue is higher energy than green.

So if the dye emits green, it's likely absorbing blue light. Because blue is higher energy than green.

So the compound would absorb blue light (2.75 eV) and emit green (2.3393 eV).

So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the compound absorbs violet light, it would emit something lower than green, but that's possible as well.

Wait, but the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So if the absorbed is blue (2.756 eV), that's higher than 2.3393 eV, so it makes sense.

So the answer would be blue, option C.

Wait, but that would require the molecule to absorb blue and emit green. So the color absorbed is blue.

But another thought: if a molecule has an extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, meaning the energy required is lower, so the absorbed photon is lower energy (longer wavelength, red end). But in this case, the emission is at 2.3393 eV (green), which is a higher energy gap. So perhaps the conjugated system isn't extremely large.

Alternatively, perhaps the extensive conjugation leads to lower energy emission. Wait, more conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) emission. But in this case, the emission is at 2.3393 eV (green), which is lower energy than blue or violet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me recap.

The problem: A dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV (green). What color is absorbed?

The options are A) Red (low energy), B) Violet (high energy), C) Blue (higher than green), D) Yellow (lower than green).

So the absorbed must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the options are B or C.

But which is more likely?

In fluorescence, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than the emitted. So the absorbed is either blue or violet.

In the absence of more data, perhaps the question expects to know that the emitted photon is the complementary color of the absorbed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy corresponds to blue. Let me compute 450 nm (blue): 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So if the absorbed is blue, the emitted is green.

Therefore, the color absorbed is blue, which is option C.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. But that would imply that the absorbed has the same energy, which is green, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. But I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the fact that the emitted light is in the green range, so the absorbed is in the blue or violet. So the options are B and C.

But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy of 2.3393 eV is the energy of the absorbed photon, but that can't be because the emitted photon would need to have lower energy than that, which would be an even lower wavelength, which is not possible.

Wait, no: energy is inversely related to wavelength. So higher energy (lower wavelength) photons have higher energy. So if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher than that.

So the only options higher than that are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

Which one is more likely? Hmm.

Another angle: the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation typically leads to lower energy transitions, meaning longer wavelength (lower energy) absorbed. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower in energy.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), which is a relatively high energy. So perhaps the conjugation isn't that extensive, leading to a higher energy transition. So the absorbed photon would be higher energy, like blue or violet.

Wait, perhaps it's more likely to absorb blue. Because blue is a higher energy than green, but not as high as violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to compute the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and then pick the complementary color.

Wait, no, complementary color is about what we see when we mix colors, not directly about the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the energy corresponding to green being the absorbed, but that's not an option.

I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Based on the options, the absorbed must be blue or violet.

Given that, and considering that 2.3393 eV is in the green range, which is between blue and yellow, perhaps the absorbed photon is blue.

So the answer would be C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The compound emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon's energy because the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference during relaxation.

The energy of a photon is inversely related to its wavelength, meaning higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. The emitted photon at 2.3393 eV (green) corresponds to a wavelength of 530 nm. The absorbed photon must therefore have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to either violet (400–450 nm, 3.1–2.75 eV) or blue (450–495 nm, 2.75–2.27 eV).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) Red**: Red light has a longer wavelength (620–750 nm) and lower energy than green light. Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, red cannot be the absorbed color.
- **B) Violet**: Violet light has a shorter wavelength (400–450 nm) and higher energy (3.1–2.75 eV) than green light. This is a valid option for the absorbed photon.
- **C) Blue**: Blue light has a slightly longer wavelength (450–495 nm) and slightly lower energy (2.75–2.27 eV) than violet light but still higher energy than green light. This is also a valid option for the absorbed photon.
- **D) Yellow**: Yellow light has a longer wavelength (570–590 nm) and lower energy than green light. Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, yellow cannot be the absorbed color.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, making violet and blue the only valid options. Between violet and blue, blue is more likely because it has a slightly lower energy gap compared to violet, which aligns with the energy difference of 2.3393 eV for the emitted photon. Thus, the compound is most likely absorbing blue light.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a textile dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between molecular orbitals. So, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the transition between these orbitals.

Oh right, the energy of the emitted light is the same as the energy gap, but wait no— when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. Then, when it emits light, it's usually at a slightly lower energy because of possible losses, but in this case, I think the question is considering the energy of the absorbed photon as the same as the energy of the emitted photon. Or maybe not. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy of the absorbed photon minus any losses, but for simplicity in these problems, they often equate the two. So if the molecule emits light at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference (the band gap) between the excited state and the ground state. So the molecule must have absorbed a photon of that energy to get excited.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs light, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher energy state (excited). Then, when it relaxes back, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference between the ground and excited states. The emitted photon's energy is the same as that energy difference (if there's no loss), but sometimes there's a difference because of other factors. But I think for this problem, we can assume that the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the emitted.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, that's the energy that causes the transition. Then, when it emits, it might emit a photon of lower energy. But sometimes, in fluorescence, the emitted photon can be lower energy than the absorbed. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, gets excited, and then emits a photon of lower energy as it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the emitted photon's energy is the energy gap between the excited state and the lower state it relaxes to. Or perhaps it's the same as the energy of the absorbed photon minus some energy loss.

But in this problem, the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which means that the energy gap is 2.3393 eV. So the molecule absorbed a photon of that energy.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the energy of the emitted light is the energy of the photon that the molecule emits when it relaxes. So the energy of the photon emitted would be the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the emitted photon's energy, assuming no other energy losses. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you absorb a photon and then emit one with the same energy, you're not really doing anything. That's probably not the case.

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Let me correct this. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the lower state the molecule relaxes to. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground state to a higher energy state (excited state). Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon. The emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited state and the state it's relaxing to.

Wait, but in many cases, the molecule might emit a photon when it drops from the excited state to a lower state, not necessarily all the way to the ground state. But in the simplest case, let's assume it's the ground state.

So the energy of the photon emitted is the same as the energy of the photon absorbed. Wait, but that can't be right because the energy of the emitted photon would be lower than the absorbed if there's a difference in the states. For example, if you absorb a higher energy photon and then emit a lower energy one due to some energy loss.

Alternatively, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the transition from the excited state to the ground state, which is the same as the energy of the photon absorbed. So in that case, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon.

Wait, but that would imply that the molecule absorbed and emitted the same energy, which doesn't change anything. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another way: the energy of the light emitted is the energy gap between the excited state and the next lower state. The absorbed photon's energy is the gap between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted photon, perhaps.

But I'm not sure. Let's think in terms of colors. The energy of the photon is inversely related to the wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths, which correspond to higher frequency and colors on the blue end of the spectrum. Lower energy photons are longer wavelengths, red end.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, what color is that? Let me calculate the wavelength.

The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and E is in Joules.

So λ = hc/E.

But E is given in eV. To convert eV to Joules, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.747e-19 J.

λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.747e-19 J.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.747e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 ≈ 5.306e-7 meters.

5.306e-7 meters is 530.6 nanometers.

530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the options given are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Hmm, none of the options are green. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check.

Wait, 530 nm is green. But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green light, then the color it absorbed is... Well, when something emits a certain color, it's because it absorbed the complementary color.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The color we see is what's emitted. The absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. Wait, maybe the confusion is whether the emitted light is the same as the absorbed. Let me think again.

Wait, the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So the molecule is absorbing a photon of that energy, causing it to emit green. But that would mean it absorbs green and emits green? That doesn't make sense because then it wouldn't change color. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no, another approach: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's typically in the UV or visible range. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between the molecule's orbitals. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed photon, but perhaps it's the same. Wait, no, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of what color is absorbed to cause the emission. So when a dye emits green light, it probably absorbed a higher energy (lower wavelength) photon, perhaps blue or violet. Let me think about the energy levels.

If the emission is at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have higher energy because the molecule goes from ground state to excited state upon absorbing.

So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted photon. Because during fluorescence, the molecule emits a photon of lower energy than the one absorbed. So if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed photon would be higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

Wait, but let me compute the energy again. 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So, if the absorbed photon is higher energy than 2.3393 eV, it would be a shorter wavelength (higher frequency). What color is that?

The visible spectrum goes roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So a photon with energy higher than 2.3393 eV (which is 530 nm or green) would have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. So possible colors are blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (around 380-450 nm).

But the question is asking what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon would be in the violet or blue range, because those have higher energy than green.

Wait, but wait: the question says the compound emits 2.3393 eV, which is green, so it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (blue or violet). So the compound absorbs that higher energy photon, and then emits lower energy (green) photon. So the absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted.

So the options are A) Red (longer wavelength, lower energy), which is 620-750 nm, so lower than 530. So that's not. B) Violet is 380-450. C) Blue is 450-495. D) Yellow is 570-590. Wait, which is longer than green.

Wait, wait. Let me correct the visible spectrum ranges.

Violet: ~380-450 nm

Blue: ~450-495 nm

Green: ~495-570 nm

Yellow: ~570-590 nm

Orange: ~590-620 nm

Red: ~620-750 nm

So, 530 nm is in the green range.

So if the dye emits green (530 nm, 2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher energy. Higher energy than 2.3393 eV would be shorter wavelength than 530 nm, so either violet or blue.

So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Wait, but which one? So what's the energy corresponding to violet and blue?

Let me compute the energy for blue and violet.

Violet light, say 400 nm: E = (1240 eV·nm)/400 nm = 3.1 eV.

Blue light, say 450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than both blue and violet. So the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue or violet.

But wait, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that. Hence, the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But looking at the options, B is Violet and C is Blue. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question says the compound absorbs the light. So the absorbed photon must be the energy that causes the transition. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon's energy.

So the question is, what color is absorbed? It could be violet or blue, but which one?

Wait, maybe I should think about the complement. Wait, the color we see is the color that's transmitted or emitted. So if the compound emits green (530 nm), then the color absorbed is the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and violet. But magenta isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed color is the one at 2.3393 eV. But that would be green, which is not in the options. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the energy of the absorbed photon. The question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon would be the same as the energy gap between the ground and excited states. So the absorbed photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. But the options don't have green. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher, like blue or violet.

But how do I decide between blue and violet? Let's think about the energy. The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV.

If the absorbed photon's energy is higher, say 2.75 eV (which is blue), then the emitted photon is 2.339 eV.

So the absorbed photon's energy is 2.75 eV, which is blue. Therefore, the compound absorbs blue light, and emits green.

But wait, another thought: the energy emitted could be the energy difference between the initial and final states when the molecule relaxes. So the absorbed photon could be higher in energy than the emitted.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the wavelengths.

E=hc/lambda, so higher energy means shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm (green). So possible colors are violet (400-450 nm) or blue (450-495). So the energies would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

If the absorbed photon is violet, which is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than blue, then the energy would be higher than blue.

Wait, but blue is at around 450 nm, which is higher energy than green. Violet is at 400, which is higher than blue.

So the energy of a violet photon is higher than that of a blue photon, which in turn is higher than green.

So if the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon must be higher, either blue or violet.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed photon being equal to the energy of the emitted photon. But that would make no sense because the molecule would emit the same energy it absorbed, which wouldn't cause a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon must match that energy. So the absorbed photon would be 2.3393 eV, which is green. But since green isn't an option, I'm confused.

Wait, the options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength.

Wait, let's compute the wavelength again. E = 2.3393 eV.

So E in Joules: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.747e-19 J.

Now, c = 3e8 m/s.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = h c / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.747e-19.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator: 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 = 5.306e-7 m = 530.6e-9 m = 530.6 nm.

Yes, that's correct. So 530 nm is green. So the emitted light is green.

So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than green, which is either blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which one is correct? Well, the energy of blue is about 2.75 eV (at 450 nm), and violet is higher, around 3.1 eV (at 400 nm).

So the question is, which of these is the color absorbed. But the question states that the compound emits at 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. But without more info, how do we choose?

Wait, another angle: the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the emitted photon would be of lower energy (longer wavelength), meaning red, orange, etc.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap. Lower energy gaps mean that the energy required to excite the electron is less. So lower energy photons (longer wavelength, like red) are absorbed.

Wait, but wait: the energy of the photon corresponds to the energy gap. If the gap is small, a lower energy photon (longer wavelength) is needed. So for a molecule with a large conjugated pi system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is of lower energy, longer wavelength (like red).

But in this case, the molecule is emitting light at 2.3393 eV (green). So if the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, the conjugated system must be such that it requires that energy. Hmm, but that's a relatively large energy gap. Maybe for something with a moderately conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the question.

The question is, what color is absorbed? The molecule emits 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

Which option is higher than 2.3393 eV? Let's compute their energies.

Compute energy for each option:

A) Red: Let's take 650 nm (red is around 620-750 nm). E = 1240 / 650 ≈ 1.907 eV. Lower than 2.3393 eV. So if the emitted is 2.339, red would be lower than that, so can't be absorbed.

B) Violet: Let's take 400 nm. E = 1240 /400 = 3.1 eV. Higher than 2.3393 eV. So possible.

C) Blue: 450 nm. E=1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Higher than 2.3393 eV. Also possible.

D) Yellow: 580 nm. E=1240/580 ≈ 2.138 eV. Lower than 2.3393. So not possible.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue).

But which one is more likely? Hmm.

Wait, the question states that the compound emits light upon absorbing. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy difference between the excited state and ground state. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.75 eV).

But without knowing the exact energy gap, perhaps we can think about the position. The compound emits green, so it's absorbing either blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: in many dyes, the color absorbed is the complementary color of what they emit. So, if a dye emits green, the color it absorbs is magenta (which is a combination of red and blue/violet). But since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the closest option is violet or blue.

But the options are B and C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up approximate energy levels for common dyes.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap between the orbitals. So if the molecule emits green, that would correspond to the energy difference between the states. So the absorbed photon would have the same energy as the emitted, but that doesn't make sense for absorption because you need higher energy to get excited.

Wait, no, that can't be. Absorption requires that the photon's energy matches the energy needed to promote an electron from a lower to a higher energy level. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference between these levels. The emitted photon's energy is the energy difference when the electron returns to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon only in the case where the molecule goes directly from the ground state to the excited state, and then back. But in reality, after excitation, the molecule might lose some energy (like through vibrations or other transitions) before emitting the photon. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So in this case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed must be higher than that.

So the possible colors are blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So, which is more likely? The question says the compound is a textile dye. Dyes often absorb in the visible range, and emit in the visible range as well. For example, many dyes absorb in the UV or blue/violet and emit in the visible (like green, yellow, red).

So, if the dye emits green, it might be absorbing blue or violet.

But without more specific info, it's a bit tricky. However, blue has a lower energy than violet. Let's compute the energy for 2.3393 eV and see if it's in the blue or violet region.

Wait, 2.3393 eV corresponds to 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher, so either blue (450 nm: 2.756 eV) or violet (400 nm: 3.1 eV).

But the question is about which color is absorbed. So among the options, B is Violet and C is Blue.

So which one has energy higher than 2.3393 eV?

Violet is higher, as 3.1 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. Blue is 2.756 eV, which is also higher than 2.3393 eV.

So both B and C are possible.

Wait, but maybe the energy of 2.3393 eV is the energy of the absorbed photon. Then the emitted photon would be lower. But that can't be because the question says the dye emits that light upon absorbing.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy gap. So the absorption must be at that same energy.

But that would mean the compound absorbs green light, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the colors and their energies.

Green is 2.3393 eV.

Blue is about 2.75 eV.

Violet is about 3.1 eV.

So, if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed either blue or violet. But which is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy required for the transition is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be of that energy. But then, since green isn't an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is the energy of the transition. So the molecule absorbed a photon of that energy. So the color absorbed is green. But since the options don't include green, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength calculation.

Wait, let me compute the wavelength using E = 1240 / lambda (in nm) eV.

So E = 2.3393 eV = 1240 / lambda.

So lambda = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm.

Yes, right. So 530 nm is green.

So if the compound emits green, it absorbed a photon of higher energy. So either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is blue, but why?

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical colors absorbed by dyes that emit green. For example, some dyes absorb blue and emit green. Because blue is higher energy than green.

So if the dye emits green, it's likely absorbing blue light. Because blue is higher energy than green.

So the compound would absorb blue light (2.75 eV) and emit green (2.3393 eV).

So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the compound absorbs violet light, it would emit something lower than green, but that's possible as well.

Wait, but the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So if the absorbed is blue (2.756 eV), that's higher than 2.3393 eV, so it makes sense.

So the answer would be blue, option C.

Wait, but that would require the molecule to absorb blue and emit green. So the color absorbed is blue.

But another thought: if a molecule has an extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, meaning the energy required is lower, so the absorbed photon is lower energy (longer wavelength, red end). But in this case, the emission is at 2.3393 eV (green), which is a higher energy gap. So perhaps the conjugated system isn't extremely large.

Alternatively, perhaps the extensive conjugation leads to lower energy emission. Wait, more conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) emission. But in this case, the emission is at 2.3393 eV (green), which is lower energy than blue or violet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me recap.

The problem: A dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV (green). What color is absorbed?

The options are A) Red (low energy), B) Violet (high energy), C) Blue (higher than green), D) Yellow (lower than green).

So the absorbed must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the options are B or C.

But which is more likely?

In fluorescence, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than the emitted. So the absorbed is either blue or violet.

In the absence of more data, perhaps the question expects to know that the emitted photon is the complementary color of the absorbed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy corresponds to blue. Let me compute 450 nm (blue): 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So if the absorbed is blue, the emitted is green.

Therefore, the color absorbed is blue, which is option C.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. But that would imply that the absorbed has the same energy, which is green, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. But I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the fact that the emitted light is in the green range, so the absorbed is in the blue or violet. So the options are B and C.

But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy of 2.3393 eV is the energy of the absorbed photon, but that can't be because the emitted photon would need to have lower energy than that, which would be an even lower wavelength, which is not possible.

Wait, no: energy is inversely related to wavelength. So higher energy (lower wavelength) photons have higher energy. So if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher than that.

So the only options higher than that are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

Which one is more likely? Hmm.

Another angle: the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation typically leads to lower energy transitions, meaning longer wavelength (lower energy) absorbed. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower in energy.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), which is a relatively high energy. So perhaps the conjugation isn't that extensive, leading to a higher energy transition. So the absorbed photon would be higher energy, like blue or violet.

Wait, perhaps it's more likely to absorb blue. Because blue is a higher energy than green, but not as high as violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to compute the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and then pick the complementary color.

Wait, no, complementary color is about what we see when we mix colors, not directly about the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the energy corresponding to green being the absorbed, but that's not an option.

I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Based on the options, the absorbed must be blue or violet.

Given that, and considering that 2.3393 eV is in the green range, which is between blue and yellow, perhaps the absorbed photon is blue.

So the answer would be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The compound emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon's energy because the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference during relaxation.

The energy of a photon is inversely related to its wavelength, meaning higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. The emitted photon at 2.3393 eV (green) corresponds to a wavelength of 530 nm. The absorbed photon must therefore have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to either violet (400–450 nm, 3.1–2.75 eV) or blue (450–495 nm, 2.75–2.27 eV).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) Red**: Red light has a longer wavelength (620–750 nm) and lower energy than green light. Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, red cannot be the absorbed color.
- **B) Violet**: Violet light has a shorter wavelength (400–450 nm) and higher energy (3.1–2.75 eV) than green light. This is a valid option for the absorbed photon.
- **C) Blue**: Blue light has a slightly longer wavelength (450–495 nm) and slightly lower energy (2.75–2.27 eV) than violet light but still higher energy than green light. This is also a valid option for the absorbed photon.
- **D) Yellow**: Yellow light has a longer wavelength (570–590 nm) and lower energy than green light. Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, yellow cannot be the absorbed color.

### Conclusion:
The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, making violet and blue the only valid options. Between violet and blue, blue is more likely because it has a slightly lower energy gap compared to violet, which aligns with the energy difference of 2.3393 eV for the emitted photon. Thus, the compound is most likely absorbing blue light.

Answer: C
