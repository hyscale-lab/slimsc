Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it will decay. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I understand. So the total time we're looking at is 50 minutes that have already passed without decay, and then we're checking the probability of decay during the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes, but does the initial 100 minutes refer to the half-life or just the probability?

Wait, no. The decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay constant is probably related to that. I think radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? So the probability of decay is based on the decay constant multiplied by time.

Wait, the formula for the probability that a nucleus decays within a certain time is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. So in this problem, we're given that P is 32% for t=100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). I can rearrange that to find λ.

Let me compute that. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68)... Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856. So λ ≈ 0.3856 / 100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately to avoid mistakes. Let's think: e^(-x) = 0.68. So x is ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588). Let me calculate ln(1.470588). I remember that ln(1.4)= about 0.3365, ln(1.5)=0.4055. So 1.470588 is between 1.4 and 1.5. Let's do a linear approximation. The difference between 1.4 and 1.5 is 0.1, and 1.470588 is 0.070588 above 1.4. Hmm, but maybe a better way is to use a calculator if I were actually doing this.

Wait, wait, maybe I can compute ln(0.68) numerically. Alternatively, perhaps I can just use the approximate value I have. Let's proceed with λ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes, but wait, no—the next 150 minutes would be in addition to the 50, making a total of 200 minutes since the start. Or wait, perhaps the 50 minutes have already passed without decay, so the current time is 50 minutes. So from this point, we're looking at the next 150 minutes, so the total time from the start would be 50+150=200 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps the decay probability is just calculated for the next 150 minutes, regardless of the initial 50.

Wait, but radioactive decay has no memory. The probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. So even though 50 minutes have passed without decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past events.

But wait, no, that's not quite correct. Because the decay probability is based on the remaining time. Let me think again. The decay probability is the chance that the atom decays at any time before a certain duration. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, no. The question asks: "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So that's the probability from now (after 50 minutes) until now + 150 minutes.

Wait, but in radioactive decay, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt). So the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it hasn't decayed by the next 150 minutes (so total time 50+150=200) is e^(-λ*200).

The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it hasn't decayed before 50, minus the probability it hasn't decayed by 200. So that's e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period regardless of how much time has passed before. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because for the first 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, but if we're considering a different time frame, perhaps the calculation changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, the decay follows an exponential model, so the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt).

We are given that for t = 100 minutes, P = 32% = 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking natural log on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

=> λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100

Let me compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, and ln(0.6667) is about -0.4055. But 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.6667, so ln(0.68) is a bit higher than -0.4055. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator. Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the problem states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're interested in is the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 +150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, we need the probability of decay occurring in the next 150 minutes, starting from t=50 to t=200.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-λ *50). The probability it hasn't decayed by t=200 is e^(-λ *200). The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the difference between these two probabilities.

So:

P_decay_next_150 = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)

Let me compute each term.

First, compute 50λ:

50 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.19283

So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825

Similarly, 200λ = 200 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.77132

e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.462

So P_decay_next_150 ≈ 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, which is approximately 36.3%.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I'm supposed to compute the conditional probability. Because the fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes affects the probability for the next 150.

Wait, no, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability of decay in the next t minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed, is the same as the probability of decay in any t minutes. So perhaps the answer is the same as the given 32% for 100 minutes, but scaled for 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. The 32% is for 100 minutes. So perhaps the decay constant λ can be used to compute the probability for 150 minutes. Let's compute that.

P_150 = 1 - e^(-λ *150)

Using λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

150 * λ ≈ 0.57849

e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.561

So P_150 ≈ 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is 43.9%, approximately 44%. That's option A.

Wait, but that's assuming that the 150 minutes are starting from time zero, not after 50 minutes. However, because of the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, irrespective of the previous time, is the same as the probability for any 150-minute period. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes.

So the probability is 44%, option A.

But wait, let me double-check. I used λ as 0.0038566 per minute, which gave me P_150 as ~44%. So the correct answer would be A) 44%.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 minutes, I got about 36%, which isn't the same. So why the discrepancy? Oh, because that calculation was considering the probability between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50. But perhaps the correct approach is to compute the conditional probability.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again. The question is: given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

So the formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Where A is the event that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes, and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Alternatively, using the memoryless property of exponential distributions, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability that it decays in a 150-minute period starting now.

Which in the memoryless case simplifies to 1 - e^(-λ *150), same as the unconditional probability. So that would make the probability 44%, which is option A.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200, I got about 36%, which is lower. That suggests that the result depends on the approach. Where is the mistake?

Wait a minute. Let me compute the conditional probability correctly.

P(decay in 50-200 | no decay in 0-50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / [P(no decay in 0-50)]

But computing P(decay between 50 and 200) is equal to P(no decay at 50) - P(no decay at 200). So that's e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

The conditional probability is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ).

Hmm, which simplifies to 1 - e^(-150λ).

Ah, because e^(-200λ) = e^(-50λ -150λ) ) = e^(-50λ) * e^(-150λ).

So the numerator is e^(-50λ) (1 - e^(-150λ)).

So when we divide by e^(-50λ), we get (1 - e^(-150λ)), which is exactly the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

So the conditional probability is the same as the unconditional probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Therefore, the probability is 44%, option A.

Wait, but wait! Let me recheck the calculation I did earlier for the 150 minutes.

lambda = ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100? Wait, no, earlier I had 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ), which leads to e^(-100λ) = 0.68. So λ = (ln(0.68)) / (-100). So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So for t=150 minutes, λ*t = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, about 44%.

Yes, so the answer should be 44%, option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model for radioactive atoms. The probability of decay within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (\( P = 0.32 \)). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the formula for decay probability:

\[
P_{150} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P_{150} = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{(or 43.9%).}
\]

This result aligns with the memoryless property of radioactive decay, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **Option A (44%)**: Matches the calculated probability of decay in 150 minutes.
- **Option B (40%)**: Too low compared to the calculated value.
- **Option C (52%)**: Too high compared to the calculated value.
- **Option D (48%)**: Slightly higher than the calculated value but not accurate.

The correct answer is **44%**, corresponding to **Option A**.

The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it hasn't decayed before 50, minus the probability it hasn't decayed by 200. So that's e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period regardless of how much time has passed before. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because for the first 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, but if we're considering a different time frame, perhaps the calculation changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, the decay follows an exponential model, so the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt).

We are given that for t = 100 minutes, P = 32% = 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking natural log on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

=> λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100

Let me compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, and ln(0.6667) is about -0.4055. But 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.6667, so ln(0.68) is a bit higher than -0.4055. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator. Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the problem states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're interested in is the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 +150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, we need the probability of decay occurring in the next 150 minutes, starting from t=50 to t=200.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-λ *50). The probability it hasn't decayed by t=200 is e^(-λ *200). The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the difference between these two probabilities.

So:

P_decay_next_150 = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)

Let me compute each term.

First, compute 50λ:

50 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.19283

So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825

Similarly, 200λ = 200 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.77132

e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.462

So P_decay_next_150 ≈ 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, which is approximately 36.3%.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I'm supposed to compute the conditional probability. Because the fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes affects the probability for the next 150.

So perhaps the answer is the same as the given 32% for 100 minutes, but scaled for 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. The 32% is for 100 minutes. So perhaps the decay constant λ can be used to compute the probability for 150 minutes. Let's compute that.

P_150 = 1 - e^(-λ *150)

Using λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

150 * λ ≈ 0.57849

e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.561

So P_150 ≈ 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is 43.9%, approximately 44%. That's option A.

Wait, but that's assuming that the 150 minutes are starting from time zero, not after 50 minutes. However, because of the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, irrespective of the previous time, is the same as the probability for any 150-minute period.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 minutes, I got about 36%, which isn't the same. So why the discrepancy? Oh, because that calculation was considering the probability between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50. But perhaps the correct approach is to compute the conditional probability.

So the formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Where A is the event that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes, and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Alternatively, using the memoryless property of exponential distributions, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability that it decays in a 150-minute period starting now.

Which in the memoryless case simplifies to 1 - e^(-λ *150), same as the unconditional probability. So that would make the probability 44%, which is option A.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200, I got about 36%, which is lower. That suggests that the result depends on the approach. Where is the mistake?

Wait a minute. Let me compute the conditional probability correctly.

P(decay in 50-200 | no decay in 0-50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / [P(no decay in 0-50)]

But computing P(decay between 50 and 200) is equal to P(no decay at 50) - P(no decay at 200). So that's e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

The conditional probability is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ).

Hmm, which simplifies to 1 - e^(-150λ).

Ah, because e^(-200λ) = e^(-50λ -150λ) ) = e^(-50λ) * e^(-150λ).

So the numerator is e^(-50λ) (1 - e^(-150λ)).

So when we divide by e^(-50λ), we get (1 - e^(-150λ)), which is exactly the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

So the conditional probability is the same as the unconditional probability of decay in 150 minutes.

Therefore, the probability is 44%, option A.

Wait, but wait! Let me recheck the calculation I did earlier for the 150 minutes.

lambda = ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100? Wait, no, earlier I had 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ), which leads to e^(-100λ) = 0.68. So λ = (ln(0.68)) / (-100). So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So for t=150 minutes, λ*t = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, about 44%.

Yes, so the answer should be 44%, option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model for radioactive atoms. The probability of decay within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (\( P = 0.32 \)). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the formula for decay probability:

\[
P_{150} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P_{150} = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{(or 43.9%).}
\]

This result aligns with the memoryless property of radioactive decay, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **Option A (44%)**: Matches the calculated probability of decay in 150 minutes.
- **Option B (40%)**: Too low compared to the calculated value.
- **Option C (52%)**: Too high compared to the calculated value.
- **Option D (48%)**: Slightly higher than the calculated value but not accurate.

The correct answer is **44%**, corresponding to **Option A**.
