Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Normally, when its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The astronomers are looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Here, n1 and n2 are the number of particles in levels 1 and 2, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level, E2 and E1 are their respective energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So I think the ratio when there are no spots is R1, and when there are spots it's R2. We need to find R1/R2.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the ratio is lower. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots present). So the factor is R1 / R2.

But wait, the ratio is n2/n1. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. How does that affect the ratio?

Wait, but wait. The spots are cooler regions, but the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star as a whole has an average T of 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I'm not sure if the spots themselves are the only thing affecting the photosphere's temperature. No, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the photosphere, which is the layer where the light is emitted, now has an average T of 5500 K when spots are present. So the entire photosphere's temperature is dropping.

Wait, but wait. Even with spots, the rest of the surface (60%) is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere now at 5500 K? The question says the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Oh, wait, perhaps I should think about how effective temperature is calculated. Effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity as observed from afar. So if 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), and 60% is at 6000 K, then the effective temperature would be a sort of average based on the area. But the problem states that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K when spots are present, so perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, no. The star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K. The spots are cooler regions, but the rest is at 6000 K. So the effective temperature is a weighted average based on the areas.

Wait, but let me think again. The star's total luminosity when there are spots is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. So the effective temperature is calculated as the fourth root of (L_total / (4πR² σ)), where L_total is the sum of the luminosity from the spots and the unspotted regions.

Wait, but if 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and 60% is at T_unspotted (6000 K), then the effective temperature T_eff is given by:

T_eff^4 = (0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * T_unspotted^4)

But the problem states that when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but I don't think we can find the spot temperature directly because we only have the T_eff of the entire photosphere. Wait, no, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, but that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler. Or perhaps the effective temperature is the average, meaning the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Wait, this is a point of confusion.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is a blackbody emission from the entire star, which is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. So the correct approach is to model the star's total luminosity as the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted parts.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity per unit area is sigma * T^4. So the total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from each part.

Let me denote:

- A = total surface area of the star.
- A1 = area of spots = 0.4 A.
- A2 = unspotted area = 0.6 A.

But wait, what's the temperature of the spots? The problem doesn't specify that. It says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's total luminosity is L = sigma * T_eff^4 * A. But when 40% is covered, the total luminosity is:

L = (A1 * sigma * T_spot^4) + (A2 * sigma * T_unspotted^4)

But T_unspotted is 6000 K, as given in the problem when there are no spots. So with 40% spots, the total luminosity is:

L = 0.4 * sigma * A * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * sigma * A * (6000)^4

And the effective temperature when there are spots is 5500 K. So the total luminosity can also be written as sigma * A * (5500)^4.

Setting them equal:

0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Wait, I think that's the correct approach. Because L = sigma * A * (T_eff)^4.

So let's compute this.

Compute each term:

Compute 6000^4, 5500^4, and T_spot^4.

But maybe we can solve for T_spot. Let's compute the equation:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 + 0.6 * (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Let me compute each part numerically.

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Multiply by 0.6: 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Compute 5500^4:

5500 = 5.5e3
(5.5)^4 = 915.0625, so 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So the equation becomes:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 + 7.776e14 = 9.150625e14

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14

Divide both sides by 0.4:

(T_spot)^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4)

Let me compute this. Let's compute 3.4365625e14.

Wait, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 x10^14. The fourth root of this would be the number to the 0.25 power.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 10^14 is (10^3.5)^4, because 3.5 *4 =14. So 10^3.5 is about 3162.27766.

So 3.4365e14 is approximately (3.4365)^(1/4) * (10^14)^(1/4) ) = (approx 1.358) * 3162.27766 ≈ 4300 K.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute (3.4365625e14)^(1/4):

Take the natural logarithm: ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14)
= ln(3.4365625) ≈ 1.235, ln(1e14)=14 ln(10)≈14*2.302585≈32.236. So total ln≈1.235+32.236=33.471.

Divide by 4: 33.471/4 ≈8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ ?

e^8 is 2980. e^0.3678 is about 1.445. So 2980 *1.445 ≈ 4297 K. So approximately 4300 K for T_spot.

Wait, but the exact calculation may give a slightly different value, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps 4300 K is a good approximation.

So the spots are about 4300 K, and the unspotted regions are 6000 K.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is necessary for the current problem. Because the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the effective temperature is the average of the entire star, so the entire photosphere is not at 5500 K. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4300 K.

Wait, but the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is now at 5500 K. That would imply that the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, which doesn't make sense because spots are cooler and the rest is at 6000 K. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So, the star's total luminosity is such that its effective temperature is 5500 K. But the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So the photosphere is a mix of regions with different temperatures. But wait, the problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Hmm, but regardless, the Boltzmann equation applies locally.

Wait, but LTE is assumed, so each region contributes to the spectrum according to its own temperature. Oh, but when you have a blended spectrum, it's a sum of emission from different regions. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But if the star's photosphere has an effective temperature, which is an average, then perhaps the ratio is determined by that average T.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. That would mean that the star's photosphere is isothermal at 5500 K when spots are present. But that seems contradictory because the spots are cooler regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the star is 5500 K when 40% is covered, but the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface. Hmm. Let me try to clarify.

The effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity, as observed from a distance. But the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits light, and its temperature varies across the surface. So when we have spots, the photosphere has regions at different temperatures.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps each region contributes to the line emission. So the observed line strength would be a combination of emission from the various regions.

Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. So the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K.

Wait, but that might not make sense because the spots are cooler. So perhaps the question is referring to the average temperature of the entire photosphere, which would be 5500 K, but the ratio is determined by the local temperature in each region. So in the spots, it's cooler, and the rest is 6000 K.

But that complicates things because the ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions.

But the problem says that when the star has no spots, the photosphere's Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% is covered, it's 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower. So perhaps the question is asking about the ratio in the photosphere as a whole, which is now at 5500 K.

Wait, but that can't be, because in reality, the spots are cooler and the rest is hotter. The photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature. So maybe the question is considering the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present.

But if that's the case, then the ratio would be based on 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when there are no spots. That would make the problem easier because then we can directly apply the Boltzmann equation with T=6000 and T=5500.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, and at 6000 K when there are no spots, and we're to compare the ratio in those two cases.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So the Teff is the effective temperature of the entire star, which is determined by the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So if the photosphere is a mix of 40% spots (cooler) and 60% normal (hotter), then the ratio would be an average weighted by the contribution from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps each region emits according to its own temperature, and the overall ratio is a combination of the two. But that complicates the problem, and perhaps the intended approach is to consider the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the effective temperature of the photosphere when spots are present is 5500 K. So the ratio is determined by 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

So considering that, the ratio R is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that the energy difference (E2-E1) corresponds to the photon energy at 1448 Å. Let me compute that.

The energy E is hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But to find the exponent, we need E/(k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K).

So E/(k T) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T)

= (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23 T) )

= (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 / T

≈ 0.994 * 1e5 / T

= 99400 / T

So for T = 6000 K,

E/(k T) ≈ 99400 / 6000 ≈ 16.5667

Similarly, for T = 5500 K,

E/(k T) ≈ 99400 /5500 ≈ 18.0727

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the term is (E2-E1)/(k T), which is positive if E2 > E1. So if E2 is higher than E1, then as T increases, the exponential term decreases.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

Wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that's consistent.

So the ratio R (n2/n1) when there are no spots (T=6000) is R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-16.5667), and when there are spots (T=5500), R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-18.0727).

Wait, but wait. The ratio R is n2/n1. So R1 is when T=6000, R2 when T=5500.

So the question is asking by what factor R1/R2 does the ratio change when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.

So R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-16.5667) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-18.0727) ) ]

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out.

So R1/R2 = exp( ( -16.5667 ) - ( -18.0727 ) )

= exp( 1.506 )

Compute 1.506: e^1.506 is approximately 4.5.

Because e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 ≈4.4817, so 1.506 is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me recalculate the exponent more accurately.

Compute 99400 / 6000 = 16.566666...

99400 /5500 = 18.072727...

So the exponent is (18.0727 -16.5667) = 1.506.

e^1.506 is what?

We can compute it more accurately.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504077.

Because e^1.504077 ≈4.5.

So e^1.506 ≈ about 4.505.

So R1/R2 ≈4.5.

Which matches option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of energy levels 1 and 2, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their degeneracy factors, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **When no spots are present**, the effective temperature of the photosphere is \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **When 40% of the surface is covered by spots**, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference
The energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon energy:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(E / (kT)\)
The term \(E / (kT)\) is calculated for both temperatures. Using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

1. For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT_1} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} = 16.5667
   \]

2. For \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT_2} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} = 18.0727
   \]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio of populations
The ratio of populations is proportional to \(\exp(-E / (kT))\). Let \(R_1 = n_2 / n_1\) at \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(R_2 = n_2 / n_1\) at \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp(-E / (kT_1))}{\exp(-E / (kT_2))} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right)
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} = -0.00001515
\]

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(1.372 \times 10^{-18} \times 10^{23} \times (-0.00001515)\right) = \exp(-1.506)
\]

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Normally, when its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The astronomers are looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Here, n1 and n2 are the number of particles in levels 1 and 2, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level, E2 and E1 are their respective energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So I think the ratio when there are no spots is R1, and when there are spots it's R2. We need to find R1/R2.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the ratio is lower. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots present). So the factor is R1 / R2.

But wait, the ratio is n2/n1. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. How does that affect the ratio?

Wait, but wait. The spots are cooler regions, but the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star as a whole has an average T of 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I'm not sure if the spots themselves are the only thing affecting the photosphere's temperature. No, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the photosphere, which is the layer where the light is emitted, now has an average T of 5500 K when spots are present. So the entire photosphere's temperature is dropping.

Wait, but wait. Even with spots, the rest of the surface (60%) is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere now at 5500 K? The question says the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Oh, wait, perhaps I should think about how effective temperature is calculated. Effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity as observed from afar. So if 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), and 60% is at 6000 K, then the effective temperature would be a sort of average based on the area. But the problem states that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K when spots are present, so perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, no. The star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K. The spots are cooler regions, but the rest is at 6000 K. So the effective temperature is a weighted average based on the areas.

Wait, but let me think again. The star's total luminosity when there are spots is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. So the effective temperature is calculated as the fourth root of (L_total / (4πR² σ)), where L_total is the sum of the luminosity from the spots and the unspotted regions.

Wait, but if 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and 60% is at T_unspotted (6000 K), then the effective temperature T_eff is given by:

T_eff^4 = (0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * T_unspotted^4)

But the problem states that when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but I don't think we can find the spot temperature directly because we only have the T_eff of the entire photosphere. Wait, no, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, but that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler. Or perhaps the effective temperature is the average, meaning the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Wait, this is a point of confusion.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is a blackbody emission from the entire star, which is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. So the correct approach is to model the star's total luminosity as the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted parts.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity per unit area is sigma * T^4. So the total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from each part.

Let me denote:

- A = total surface area of the star.
- A1 = area of spots = 0.4 A.
- A2 = unspotted area = 0.6 A.

But wait, what's the temperature of the spots? The problem doesn't specify that. It says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's total luminosity is L = sigma * T_eff^4 * A. But when 40% is covered, the total luminosity is:

L = (A1 * sigma * T_spot^4) + (A2 * sigma * T_unspotted^4)

But T_unspotted is 6000 K, as given in the problem when there are no spots. So with 40% spots, the total luminosity is:

L = 0.4 * sigma * A * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * sigma * A * (6000)^4

And the effective temperature when there are spots is 5500 K. So the total luminosity can also be written as sigma * A * (5500)^4.

Setting them equal:

0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Wait, I think that's the correct approach. Because L = sigma * A * (T_eff)^4.

So let's compute this.

Compute each term:

Compute 6000^4, 5500^4, and T_spot^4.

But maybe we can solve for T_spot. Let's compute the equation:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 + 0.6 * (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Let me compute each part numerically.

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Multiply by 0.6: 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Compute 5500^4:

5500 = 5.5e3
(5.5)^4 = 915.0625, so 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So the equation becomes:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 + 7.776e14 = 9.150625e14

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14

Divide both sides by 0.4:

(T_spot)^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4)

Let me compute this. Let's compute 3.4365625e14.

Wait, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 x10^14. The fourth root of this would be the number to the 0.25 power.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 10^14 is (10^3.5)^4, because 3.5 *4 =14. So 10^3.5 is about 3162.27766.

So 3.4365e14 is approximately (3.4365)^(1/4) * (10^14)^(1/4) ) = (approx 1.358) * 3162.27766 ≈ 4300 K.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute (3.4365625e14)^(1/4):

Take the natural logarithm: ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14)
= ln(3.4365625) ≈ 1.235, ln(1e14)=14 ln(10)≈14*2.302585≈32.236. So total ln≈1.235+32.236=33.471.

Divide by 4: 33.471/4 ≈8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ ?

e^8 is 2980. e^0.3678 is about 1.445. So 2980 *1.445 ≈ 4297 K. So approximately 4300 K for T_spot.

Wait, but the exact calculation may give a slightly different value, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps 4300 K is a good approximation.

So the spots are about 4300 K, and the unspotted regions are 6000 K.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is necessary for the current problem. Because the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the effective temperature is the average of the entire star, so the entire photosphere is not at 5500 K. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4300 K.

Wait, but the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is now at 5500 K. That would imply that the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, which doesn't make sense because spots are cooler and the rest is at 6000 K. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So, the star's total luminosity is such that its effective temperature is 5500 K. But the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So the photosphere is a mix of regions with different temperatures. But wait, the problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Hmm, but regardless, the Boltzmann equation applies locally.

Wait, but LTE is assumed, so each region contributes to the spectrum according to its own temperature. Oh, but when you have a blended spectrum, it's a sum of emission from different regions. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But if the star's photosphere has an effective temperature, which is an average, then perhaps the ratio is determined by that average T.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. That would mean that the star's photosphere is isothermal at 5500 K when spots are present. But that seems contradictory because the spots are cooler regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the star is 5500 K when 40% is covered, but the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface. Hmm. Let me try to clarify.

The effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity, as observed from a distance. But the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits light, and its temperature varies across the surface. So when we have spots, the photosphere has regions at different temperatures.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps each region contributes to the line emission. So the observed line strength would be a combination of emission from the various regions.

Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. So the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K.

Wait, but that might not make sense because the spots are cooler. So perhaps the question is referring to the average temperature of the entire photosphere, which would be 5500 K, but the ratio is determined by the local temperature in each region. So in the spots, it's cooler, and the rest is 6000 K.

But that complicates things because the ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions.

But the problem says that when the star has no spots, the photosphere's Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% is covered, it's 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower. So perhaps the question is asking about the ratio in the photosphere as a whole, which is now at 5500 K.

Wait, but that can't be, because in reality, the spots are cooler and the rest is hotter. The photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature. So maybe the question is considering the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present.

But if that's the case, then the ratio would be based on 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when there are no spots. That would make the problem easier because then we can directly apply the Boltzmann equation with T=6000 and T=5500.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, and at 6000 K when there are no spots, and we're to compare the ratio in those two cases.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So the Teff is the effective temperature of the entire star, which is determined by the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So if the photosphere is a mix of 40% spots (cooler) and 60% normal (hotter), then the ratio would be an average weighted by the contribution from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps each region emits according to its own temperature, and the overall ratio is a combination of the two. But that complicates the problem, and perhaps the intended approach is to consider the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the effective temperature of the photosphere when spots are present is 5500 K. So the ratio is determined by 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

So considering that, the ratio R is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that the energy difference (E2-E1) corresponds to the photon energy at 1448 Å. Let me compute that.

The energy E is hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But to find the exponent, we need E/(k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K).

So E/(k T) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T)

= (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23 T) )

= (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 / T

≈ 0.994 * 1e5 / T

= 99400 / T

So for T = 6000 K,

E/(k T) ≈ 99400 / 6000 ≈ 16.5667

Similarly, for T = 5500 K,

E/(k T) ≈ 99400 /5500 ≈ 18.0727

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the term is (E2-E1)/(k T), which is positive if E2 > E1. So if E2 is higher than E1, then as T increases, the exponential term decreases.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

Wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that's consistent.

So the ratio R (n2/n1) when there are no spots (T=6000) is R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-16.5667), and when there are spots (T=5500), R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-18.0727).

Wait, but wait. The ratio R is n2/n1. So R1 is when T=6000, R2 when T=5500.

So the question is asking by what factor R1/R2 does the ratio change when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.

So R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-16.5667) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-18.0727) ) ]

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out.

So R1/R2 = exp( ( -16.5667 ) - ( -18.0727 ) )

= exp( 1.506 )

Compute 1.506: e^1.506 is approximately 4.5.

Because e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 ≈4.4817, so 1.506 is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me recalculate the exponent more accurately.

Compute 99400 / 6000 = 16.566666...

99400 /5500 = 18.072727...

So the exponent is (18.0727 -16.5667) = 1.506.

e^1.506 is what?

We can compute it more accurately.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504077.

Because e^1.504077 ≈4.5.

So e^1.506 ≈ about 4.505.

So R1/R2 ≈4.5.

Which matches option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of energy levels 1 and 2, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their degeneracy factors, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **When no spots are present**, the effective temperature of the photosphere is \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **When 40% of the surface is covered by spots**, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference
The energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon energy:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(E / (kT)\)
The term \(E / (kT)\) is calculated for both temperatures. Using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

1. For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT_1} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} = 16.5667
   \]

2. For \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT_2} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} = 18.0727
   \]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio of populations
The ratio of populations is proportional to \(\exp(-E / (kT))\). Let \(R_1 = n_2 / n_1\) at \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(R_2 = n_2 / n_1\) at \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp(-E / (kT_1))}{\exp(-E / (kT_2))} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right)
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} = -0.00001515
\]

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(1.372 \times 10^{-18} \times 10^{23} \times (-0.00001515)\right) = \exp(-1.506)
\]

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
