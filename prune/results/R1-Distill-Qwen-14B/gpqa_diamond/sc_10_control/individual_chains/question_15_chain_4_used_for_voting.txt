Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Now, the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They have limited time, so they need to choose the more probable candidate.

Both planets have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations since eccentricity might affect the transit probability, but here it's not a factor.

The host stars are interesting. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, wait, that's because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So while Planet_1's star is more massive, they're both the same size in radius.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / a), where a is the orbital distance. Wait, no, wait, another thought: the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), multiplied by some function of the planet's size relative to the star. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, I think the transit probability (p) is given by p = (R_star / a) * (something). Wait, I might be mixing it up. Let's get clear.

The probability of transit is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + m_star/(m_planet))), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the transit probability is when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The formula I remember is p = R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) of the planet. But wait, that's only part of the story. The exact formula is p ≈ (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (M_star/(M_planet))^(1/3))) )? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, another approach.

Wait, the transit probability is the same as the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is such that it passes in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is given by (R_star / a) * [something], but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sky as seen from Earth. Wait, no, that's a different consideration. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But for a random distribution of inclinations, the probability that i is small enough for a transit is (R_star / a) * (something). Wait, no, I think when the orbit is circular, the probability is (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (M_star/M_planet)^{1/3})) ), but that might be incorrect.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle relative to our line of sight. For a star-planet system, the probability that the planet transits is (R_star/a) * [ (R_planet + R_star) / R_star ]^2. Or maybe I'm mixing up factors.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The probability of transit depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) relative to the star's radius (R_star). The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability, because the disk of the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, no. Let me think geometrically. The probability is proportional to the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. So, it's (π R_star^2) / (π a^2) ), which simplifies to (R_star / a)^2. But wait, no, that's only if we're considering the area. But I think the transit probability is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor. Hmm.

Wait, another source I remember says that the probability that a planet transits its star is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (eccentricity term)), but since both are circular, the eccentricity is zero, and thus the transit probability is simply (R_star / a).

Wait, but wait, another formula I've heard is p = (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) ), but I'm getting confused because I'm not certain about the correct formula.

Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability (p) is approximately (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but since e=0 for both, it's just (R_star / a). But this can't be right because for a circular orbit, the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(1 + (M_star/M_planet)^{1/3}) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by the formula p = (R_star / a) * ( (1) / (1 + (M_star / M_planet )^{1/3} ) ) ). Wait, that makes sense because a more massive star would have a larger a for the same planet mass, but wait, the planet's mass is same here. So for same M_planet, same R_star, but different a.

Wait no, the formula I'm thinking of is that for a given planet mass, the semi-major axis a depends on the star's mass and the planet's mass via Kepler's third law. Since both planets have same mass, but their host stars have different masses.

But let me step back. Let's first find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet. Because a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

So, the formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³. So a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4π²).

So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

Given that, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3. Wait, no: the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) * P2.

Wait, no, correction: The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P / 3.

So, a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (M1 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (M1 P² /9 )^(1/3).

Similarly, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P^2)^(1/3).

But M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

So a1 = ( (2 M2) * (P^2/9) )^(1/3) = (2/9 * M2 P² )^(1/3).

a2 = ( M2 P² )^(1/3).

So let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2/9 M2 P² ) / ( M2 P² ) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.606.

Alternatively, exactly, (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a2 is longer than a1.

Wait, but wait: since a is proportional to (M * P² )^(1/3), and M1 is 2 M2, and P1 is P2 /3, let me plug that in.

So a1 = (M1)^(1/3) * (P1^2)^(1/3) = [ (2 M2) ]^(1/3) * [ (P2^2 / 9) ]^(1/3 ).

Which is [ 2^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) ] * [ P2^(2/3) / 9^(1/3) ].

Similarly, a2 is [ M2^(1/3) ] * [ P2^(2/3) ].

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ 2^(1/3) / 9^(1/3) ) ].

Because M2^(1/3) and P2^(2/3) are same in both. So 2/9 is (2/9), so 2/9 ≈ 0.222, cube root is ≈ 0.606. So a1 is ≈ 0.606 a2. So a1 is shorter than a2.

But wait, the transit probability depends on a, right? So if a is smaller, then R_star/a is larger, so higher probability.

But both stars have same R, since R1 = R2.

So the transit probability for each is proportional to (R_star / a).

So p1 = R/(a1), p2 = R/(a2).

Which is p1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.606 ) * (R / a2 ) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2).

Since a2 is larger, R/a2 is smaller than R/a1, but p1 is R/a1, which is larger than R/a2.

Wait, let me compute p1 and p2.

Because a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1 = R / a1.

p2 = R / a2 = R / (1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.606 p1.

Wait no, because p1 is R/a1, p2 is R/(1.65 a1).

So p1 is larger. So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

Wait, wait, let me compute the ratio p1/p2.

p1/p2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2 ) = (a2)/(a1).

We have a2 = a1 / 0.606 → a2 = (1 / 0.606) a1 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1/p2 = (1.65 a1 ) / a1 = 1.65.

So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a1 is smaller, p1 is larger.

Wait, say a1 is 0.6 a2. So a2 is ~1.666 a1.

So p1 = R/a1.

p2 = R/(1.666 a1) = 0.6 R/a1.

So p1 is about 1.666 times p2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of approx 1.65.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than what we computed.

Wait, but I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the a1 and a2.

Wait, let me recompute the a1/a2 ratio.

a1 = (M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) = (2 M2 P^2 / 9 )^(1/3 ).

a2 = ( M2 * P^2 )^(1/3 ).

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 P² /9 ) / ( M2 P² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= ( 2 /9 )^(1/3 ) = ( 2/9 )^(1/3 )

= (approx) 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Thus, the transit probability for each is R/a.

So p1 = R/a1.

p2 = R/a2 = R/(1.65 a1) ≈ (1/1.65) * (R/a1 ) ≈ 0.606 * p1.

So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of about 1.65. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( p \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which is determined by Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axes
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), where \( P_2 \) is Planet_2's orbital period.
- The mass of Planet_1's host star is \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.

Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9} \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}}{M_2P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is shorter than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Calculate the transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_1 = R_2 \), the ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \):
\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability.

### Final Answer:
The researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability by a factor of approximately 1.65.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The probability of transit depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) relative to the star's radius (R_star). The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability, because the disk of the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, no. Let me think geometrically. The probability is proportional to the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. So, it's (π R_star^2) / (π a^2) ), which simplifies to (R_star / a)^2. But wait, no, that's only if we're considering the area.

Wait, that makes sense because a more massive star would have a larger a for the same planet mass, but wait, the planet's mass is same here. So for same M_planet, same R_star, but different a.

Wait no, the formula I'm thinking of is that for a given planet mass, the semi-major axis a depends on the star's mass and the planet's mass via Kepler's third law. Since both planets have same mass, but their host stars have different masses.

But let me step back. Let's first find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet. Because a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

So, the formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³. So a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4π²).

So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

Given that, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3. Wait, no: the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) * P2.

Wait, no, correction: The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P / 3.

So, a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (M1 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (M1 P² /9 )^(1/3).

Similarly, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P^2)^(1/3).

But M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

So a1 = ( (2 M2) * (P^2/9) )^(1/3) = (2/9 * M2 P² )^(1/3).

a2 = ( M2 P² )^(1/3).

So let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2/9 M2 P² ) / ( M2 P² ) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.606.

Alternatively, exactly, (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a2 is longer than a1.

Wait, but wait: since a is proportional to (M * P² )^(1/3), and M1 is 2 M2, and P1 is P2 /3, let me plug that in.

So a1 = (M1)^(1/3) * (P1^2)^(1/3) = [ (2 M2) ]^(1/3) * [ (P2^2 / 9) ]^(1/3 ).

Which is [ 2^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) ] * [ P2^(2/3) / 9^(1/3) ].

Similarly, a2 is [ M2^(1/3) ] * [ P2^(2/3) ].

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ 2^(1/3) / 9^(1/3) ) ].

Because M2^(1/3) and P2^(2/3) are same in both. So 2/9 is (2/9), so 2/9 ≈ 0.222, cube root is ≈ 0.606. So a1 is ≈ 0.606 a2. So a1 is shorter than a2.

But wait, the transit probability depends on a, right? So if a is smaller, then R_star/a is larger, so higher probability.

But both stars have same R, since R1 = R2.

So the transit probability for each is proportional to (R_star / a).

So p1 = R/(a1), p2 = R/(a2).

Which is p1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.606 ) * (R / a2 ) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2).

Since a2 is larger, R/a2 is smaller than R/a1, but p1 is R/a1, which is larger than R/a2.

Wait, let me compute p1 and p2.

Because a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1 = R / a1.

p2 = R / a2 = R / (1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.606 p1.

Wait no, because p1 is R/a1, p2 is R/(1.65 a1).

So p1 is larger. So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

Wait, wait, let me compute the ratio p1/p2.

p1/p2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2 ) = (a2)/(a1).

We have a2 = a1 / 0.606 → a2 = (1 / 0.606) a1 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1/p2 = (1.65 a1 ) / a1 = 1.65.

So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a1 is smaller, p1 is larger.

Wait, say a1 is 0.6 a2. So a2 is ~1.666 a1.

So p1 = R/a1.

p2 = R/(1.666 a1) = 0.6 R/a1.

So p1 is about 1.666 times p2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of approx 1.65.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than what we computed.

Wait, but I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the a1 and a2.

Wait, let me recompute the a1/a2 ratio.

a1 = (M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) = (2 M2 P^2 / 9 )^(1/3 ).

a2 = ( M2 * P^2 )^(1/3 ).

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 P² /9 ) / ( M2 P² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= ( 2 /9 )^(1/3 ) = ( 2/9 )^(1/3 )

= (approx) 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Thus, the transit probability for each is R/a.

So p1 = R/a1.

p2 = R/a2 = R/(1.65 a1) ≈ (1/1.65) * (R/a1 ) ≈ 0.606 * p1.

So p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of about 1.65. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( p \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which is determined by Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axes
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), where \( P_2 \) is Planet_2's orbital period.
- The mass of Planet_1's host star is \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.

Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9} \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\frac{2M_2P_2^2}{9}}{M_2P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is shorter than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Calculate the transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_1 = R_2 \), the ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \):
\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability.

### Final Answer:
The researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability by a factor of approximately 1.65.
