Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds like a neutralization problem. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they completely neutralize each other or if there's excess left.

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it will dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll also dissociate completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate much. But when you mix them all together, probably the strong acids and strong base will react first.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let's start with each solution.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl:
Molarity 0.2 M, volume 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole of H+ ions. So HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes 0.05 moles of H+ (but since it's weak, it doesn't dissociate completely, but maybe we can consider it as contributing some H+? Wait, but when mixed with a strong base, perhaps the H+ from the strong acid and the base's OH- will neutralize each other first, and then any excess will determine the pH. So the acetic acid might only come into play if there's leftover acid or base after the neutralization of the strong components.

Wait, but let me think: When you mix all three solutions, the resultant volume is the sum of the three volumes. 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. But let's get back to that after figuring out the neutralization.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, meaning it will fully donate H+ ions. The OH- comes only from Ba(OH)2 since the others are acids.

So the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until one of them is used up, and any excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ (0.08 moles). Ba(OH)2 contributes OH- (0.18 moles). So the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ available from HCl and CH3COOH: but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in pure solution it doesn't contribute much H+. But when mixed with a base, perhaps the base will deprotonate some of the acetic acid? Or does the strong acid and base neutralization happen first, and then any leftover strong acid/base reacts with the weak acid/base?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to first calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid. So all 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl will be available. The acetic acid's H+ is not all available because it's a weak acid. But in the presence of a strong base, will the strong base react with the acetic acid first?

Wait no, the OH- from the base will react with H+ from acids. The strong acid HCl will donate H+ first, and any excess OH- will then react with the weak acid.

Wait, let me think again. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18 moles. So when they mix, 0.08 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

So after neutralizing the H+ from HCl, we have excess OH- of 0.10 moles.

Now, what about the acetic acid? The remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid. Wait, does OH- react with CH3COOH?

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it dissociates slightly: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The OH- from the solution (from excess base) can react with the H+ from the acetic acid. But wait, since the OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So the reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- will neutralize one mole of CH3COOH, producing its conjugate base.

So we have 0.10 moles of OH- left after neutralizing the HCl. How much CH3COOH do we have?

We have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So 0.10 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, because each OH- neutralizes one CH3COOH molecule.

Wait, but that's only 0.05 moles of OH- needed. So 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- will remain after neutralizing all the CH3COOH.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:

Total OH- after HCl neutralization: 0.10 moles.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

Each OH- will take 1 mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 moles of OH- will neutralize the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after that, we have 0.05 moles of OH- in the solution.

Now, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. Neutralize H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Now, neutralize the remaining OH- with CH3COOH. CH3COOH has 0.05 mol.

So 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the total OH- in solution is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait another point: Ba(OH)2 is a base, and each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.3 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.6 moles OH-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^−.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, you get 2 moles of OH−. So 0.3 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.3 * 2 = 0.6 moles of OH−.

Wait, oh! I must have made a mistake earlier. Earlier, I thought 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, but wait, no. Let's recompute.

Wait, I think I messed up the initial calculation of moles for Ba(OH)2.

Wait, the solution is 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH−, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH−. Oh wait, that's correct. So I didn't make a mistake there. So the OH− from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

So going back, after HCl's H+ neutralizes 0.08 moles of OH−, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH− left.

Then, this OH− will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So each OH− neutralizes a CH3COOH molecule. So 0.05 moles of OH− will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH−.

Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is an acid, so when OH− is added, it's a neutralization reaction: OH− + CH3COOH → CH3COO− + H2O.

So that's correct. So after that, there's 0.05 moles of OH− left.

So the total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH− is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is calculated as -log(0.0416667). Let's compute that.

Wait, 0.0416667 is approximately 1/24. So log(1/24) = log(1) - log(24) = 0 - log(24). log(24) is about 1.3802, so log(1/24) is -1.3802. So pOH would be 1.3802. Then pH is 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the pH.

But wait a minute, is there any possibility that any of the other ions are affecting things? Like, does Ba^2+ or Cl− have any impact? I don't think so because they are spectator ions. So the pH is determined by the excess OH− from Ba(OH)2 after neutralizing the HCl and CH3COOH.

So the pH should be about 12.62, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solutions provided are:

1. **500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**: Acetic acid is a weak acid, contributing 0.05 moles of H⁺ (calculated as \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \)).

2. **400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)**: HCl is a strong acid, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ (calculated as \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \)).

3. **300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide)**: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, dissociating completely to produce \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ (calculated as \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \)).

### Neutralization Process:
1. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻**: The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)₂) react first. The H⁺ from HCl neutralizes the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:
   \[
   \text{H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O}
   \]
   - Moles of H⁺ from HCl: \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \)
   - Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \)
   - After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

2. **Reaction between excess OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**: The remaining OH⁻ reacts with the weak acid (CH₃COOH):
   \[
   \text{OH⁻ + CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O}
   \]
   - Moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \)
   - Moles of OH⁻ remaining: \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

### Final Solution:
After all neutralization reactions, the solution contains \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of excess OH⁻. The total volume of the solution is:
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of OH⁻ is:
\[
\text{[OH⁻]} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Conclusion:
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it will dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll also dissociate completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate much. But when you mix them all together, probably the strong acids and strong base will react first.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let's start with each solution.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl:
Molarity 0.2 M, volume 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole of H+ ions. So HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes 0.05 moles of H+ (but since it's weak, it doesn't dissociate completely, but maybe we can consider it as contributing some H+? Wait, but when mixed with a strong base, perhaps the H+ from the strong acid and the base's OH- will neutralize each other first, and then any excess will determine the pH. So the acetic acid might only come into play if there's leftover acid or base after the neutralization of the strong components.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, meaning it will fully donate H+ ions. The OH- comes only from Ba(OH)2 since the others are acids.

So the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until one of them is used up, and any excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ (0.08 moles). Ba(OH)2 contributes OH- (0.18 moles). So the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ available from HCl and CH3COOH: but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in pure solution it doesn't contribute much H+. But when mixed with a base, perhaps the base will deprotonate some of the acetic acid? Or does the strong acid and base neutralization happen first, and then any leftover strong acid/base reacts with the weak acid/base?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to first calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait no, the OH- from the base will react with H+ from acids. The strong acid HCl will donate H+ first, and any excess OH- will then react with the weak acid.

Wait, let me think again. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18 moles. So when they mix, 0.08 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

So after neutralizing the H+ from HCl, we have excess OH- of 0.10 moles.

Now, what about the acetic acid? The remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid. Wait, does OH- react with CH3COOH?

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it dissociates slightly: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The OH- from the solution (from excess base) can react with the H+ from the acetic acid. But wait, since the OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So the reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- will neutralize one mole of CH3COOH, producing its conjugate base.

So we have 0.10 moles of OH- left after neutralizing the HCl. How much CH3COOH do we have?

We have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So 0.10 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, because each OH- neutralizes one CH3COOH molecule.

Wait, but that's only 0.05 moles of OH- needed. So 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- will remain after neutralizing all the CH3COOH.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:

Total OH- after HCl neutralization: 0.10 moles.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

Each OH- will take 1 mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 moles of OH- will neutralize the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after that, we have 0.05 moles of OH- in the solution.

Now, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. Neutralize H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Now, neutralize the remaining OH- with CH3COOH. CH3COOH has 0.05 mol.

So 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the total OH- in solution is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait another point: Ba(OH)2 is a base, and each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.3 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.6 moles OH-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^−.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, you get 2 moles of OH−. So 0.3 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.3 * 2 = 0.6 moles of OH−.

Wait, oh! I must have made a mistake earlier. Earlier, I thought 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, but wait, no. Let's recompute.

Wait, I think I messed up the initial calculation of moles for Ba(OH)2.

Wait, the solution is 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH−, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH−. Oh wait, that's correct. So I didn't make a mistake there. So the OH− from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

So going back, after HCl's H+ neutralizes 0.08 moles of OH−, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH− left.

Then, this OH− will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So each OH− neutralizes a CH3COOH molecule. So 0.05 moles of OH− will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH−.

Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is an acid, so when OH− is added, it's a neutralization reaction: OH− + CH3COOH → CH3COO− + H2O.

So that's correct. So after that, there's 0.05 moles of OH− left.

So the total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH− is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is calculated as -log(0.0416667). Let's compute that.

Wait, 0.0416667 is approximately 1/24. So log(1/24) = log(1) - log(24) = 0 - log(24). log(24) is about 1.3802, so log(1/24) is -1.3802. So pOH would be 1.3802. Then pH is 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the pH.

But wait a minute, is there any possibility that any of the other ions are affecting things? Like, does Ba^2+ or Cl− have any impact? I don't think so because they are spectator ions. So the pH is determined by the excess OH− from Ba(OH)2 after neutralizing the HCl and CH3COOH.
