Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed.

First, let me understand the Lagrangian. The term is -λf ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think it's probably supposed to be something like λ times some field f times ψ bar times X times ψ. So maybe it's an interaction between the boson X and fermions ψ. So, the X boson is interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into two particles, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV. But wait, I should remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, for a decay X → f f_bar, each fermion f must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f < m_X.

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay can have a mass up to 3 GeV because 2*3=6. So let me think about the masses of the fermions.

The known fermion masses (approximate):

- e- (electron): ~0.0005 GeV
- mu+: ~0.105 GeV
- tau+: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~0.003 GeV (but in reality up and down quarks are much lighter, around a few MeV)
- d: ~0.005 GeV
- s: ~0.095 GeV (again, s quark is about 100 MeV)
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So the fermion masses must be less than 3 GeV each. So when considering decay products, each particle's mass must be less than 3 GeV.

So looking at the options, the possible decay products are pairs of particles and their antiparticles. For example, bb̄, cc̄, etc.

Looking at each option:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, the b quark has a mass of about 4.5 GeV. Each b would require 4.5 GeV. So 2*m_b is 9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So 4.5 *2=9>6, so X can't decay into b and anti-b. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Check the c quark: m_c ~1.27 GeV. 2*1.27=2.54 <6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed. τ is about 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 <6. So tau pair is allowed. Similarly, muon pair: 2 *0.105=0.21 <6. Electrons are fine too. So these are all allowed.

Wait, but what about the s quark? m_s is about 0.095 GeV. 2*0.095=0.19 <6. So s s̄ is allowed.

u and d are even lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

So option B includes c c̄, which has a mass sum under 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e.

Wait, the top quark is way too heavy. m_t is 173 GeV, which is way more than 3 GeV. So t and t̄ would require 2*173=346 GeV, which is way higher than X's 6 GeV. So decay into t t̄ is impossible. So option C is invalid because it includes t t̄.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

Again, the b quark is 4.5 GeV, which as before, 2*4.5=9>6. So b b̄ decay is not allowed. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

So the only correct option is B, because it includes only fermions whose masses are each less than 3 GeV. Let me double-check:

Option B's decay products:

c c̄: 2*1.27=2.54 <6 → allowed.

s s̄: 0.095*2=0.19 <6 → allowed.

u ū: negligible, allowed.

d d̄: same as u.

tau+ tau−: each is 1.78 GeV → 3.56 <6 → allowed.

mu pair: 0.21 <6 → allowed.

e pair: even smaller, allowed.

So B is the correct option.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The known approximate masses of fermions are:

- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u, m_d \approx 0.003, 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), where \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option A is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \). Checking the masses:
   - \( 2m_c = 2.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( 2m_u, 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   All these decays are allowed. Hence, Option B is correct.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), where \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option C is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), where \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \). As in Option A, \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**, as all the included fermion pairs satisfy \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

**Answer: B**

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed.

But wait, I should remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, for a decay X → f f_bar, each fermion f must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f < m_X.

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay can have a mass up to 3 GeV because 2*3=6. So let me think about the masses of the fermions.

The known fermion masses (approximate):

- e- (electron): ~0.0005 GeV
- mu+: ~0.105 GeV
- tau+: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~0.003 GeV (but in reality up and down quarks are much lighter, around a few MeV)
- d: ~0.005 GeV
- s: ~0.095 GeV (again, s quark is about 100 MeV)
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So the fermion masses must be less than 3 GeV each. So when considering decay products, each particle's mass must be less than 3 GeV.

So looking at the options, the possible decay products are pairs of particles and their antiparticles. For example, bb̄, cc̄, etc.

Looking at each option:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, the b quark has a mass of about 4.5 GeV. Each b would require 4.5 GeV. So 2*m_b is 9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So 4.5 *2=9>6, so X can't decay into b and anti-b. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Check the c quark: m_c ~1.27 GeV. 2*1.27=2.54 <6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed. τ is about 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 <6. So tau pair is allowed. Similarly, muon pair: 2 *0.105=0.21 <6. Electrons are fine too. So these are all allowed.

Wait, but what about the s quark? m_s is about 0.095 GeV. 2*0.095=0.19 <6. So s s̄ is allowed.

u and d are even lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

So option B includes c c̄, which has a mass sum under 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e.

Wait, the top quark is way too heavy. m_t is 173 GeV, which is way more than 3 GeV. So t and t̄ would require 2*173=346 GeV, which is way higher than X's 6 GeV. So decay into t t̄ is impossible. So option C is invalid because it includes t t̄.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

Again, the b quark is 4.5 GeV, which as before, 2*4.5=9>6. So b b̄ decay is not allowed. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

So the only correct option is B, because it includes only fermions whose masses are each less than 3 GeV. Let me double-check:

Option B's decay products:

c c̄: 2*1.27=2.54 <6 → allowed.

s s̄: 0.095*2=0.19 <6 → allowed.

u ū: negligible, allowed.

d d̄: same as u.

tau+ tau−: each is 1.78 GeV → 3.56 <6 → allowed.

mu pair: 0.21 <6 → allowed.

e pair: even smaller, allowed.

So B is the correct option.

   All these decays are allowed. Hence, Option B is correct.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), where \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option C is incorrect.
