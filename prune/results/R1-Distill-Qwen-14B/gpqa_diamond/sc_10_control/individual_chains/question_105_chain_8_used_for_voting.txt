Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The scenario is that when the star rotates, spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. These variations can look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

So, when an exoplanet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The goal here is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip from the planet equals the dip from the spots.

Wait, but wait. The spots themselves cause a variation. So first, I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots and then set that equal to the variation caused by a planet and solve for Rpl.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

First, the brightness variation caused by the exoplanet when it transits the star is well-known. The formula for the relative change in brightness (ΔF) during transit is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because when the planet covers a fraction A of the star's disk, the dip is proportional to (A/(π Rstar²)) * (π Rpl²) ), which simplifies to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the star's brightness isn't uniform because parts are covered by spots. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and the observed brightness changes because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light.

So, to calculate the variation in brightness due to the spots, I need to compute the difference in flux when the spots are facing us versus when they're not.

The star's total flux when all spots are on the visible side would be the sum of the flux from the non-spotty areas and the spotty areas.

Wait, let me clarify: The star is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%—so 20% of that hemisphere's surface is spots, and 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is completely normal.

When the star rotates, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. Suppose the star is rotating such that the spotty hemisphere is the one we observe when the star is at a certain point in its rotation. Wait no, wait, actually, the star's rotation would cause different parts to come into view. So perhaps the spotty hemisphere is the one we're looking at when the spots are in the direction of the observer. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the star is such that one hemisphere is entirely spotted (but only 20% filled), and the other is spot-free. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when it's the other hemisphere, we don't.

But no, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, does that mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered in spots, or that 20% of each hemisphere is covered? No, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of the spots is 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots in that hemisphere. So in the hemisphere with spots, 20% is spots, and 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is completely normal. So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere area.

So the star's total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere area is 2πR². So the spotty hemisphere has 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of spots. The other hemisphere is 2πR², all normal.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux we receive is the flux from 0.8 * 2πR² (non-spots) plus 0.2 * 2πR² (spots). Wait, no: the spotty hemisphere has 20% spots, so 80% normal. So the flux from the spotty side when it's facing us is 0.8*(normal flux per unit area) * 2πR² + 0.2*(spot flux per unit area) * 2πR².

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR² * σTeff^4.

But when spots are present, the flux is a bit less. Let's compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible, and when the other hemisphere is visible.

Wait, the star is a sphere, and when viewed from Earth, only the front hemisphere is visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots and normal areas. When it's the other hemisphere, we don't see any spots.

So the two scenarios are:

1. Spotty hemisphere is visible.

   The flux from the spotty hemisphere is: (0.8 * F_normal + 0.2 * F_spots) * (2πR²/4πR²) ) * 4πR²? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fraction of the star's surface that's emitting normally or less.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it isn't.

First, the total flux without spots is F0 = 4πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the front surface area is 2πR². Of that, 20% is spots at 5000K, and 80% is normal at 6000K.

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * (σ*(6000)^4) * 2πR²) + (0.2 * (σ*(5000)^4) * 2πR²)

The other hemisphere (non-spotty) contributes nothing because it's on the back.

Wait, no, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is not visible. So the total flux is just F_spotty.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, it's all normal, so the flux is F_non_spotty = 2πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

So the flux variation is the difference between F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

Wait, no. The star's rotation will cause different parts to come into view. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_non_spotty.

So, the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is visible. The change in flux (ΔF) would be F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Wait, but the star has two hemispheres: when one is spotty, the other is normal. So when the star is viewed from Earth, which hemisphere we see depends on its rotation. The brightness variation amplitude is the difference between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

So, let's compute F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

F_non_spotty = 2πR² * σ*(6000)^4

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2πR²) * σ*(6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2πR²) * σ*(5000)^4

So the flux difference is ΔF = F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Let me compute this.

First, let's compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4

F_spotty = 2π R² [ 0.8 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * σ (5000)^4 ]

So ΔF = F_non_spotty - F_spotty

= 2π R² σ (6000)^4 [1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Wait, let's factor out 2π R² σ (6000)^4 from both terms.

ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 [ 1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Compute the term inside the brackets:

0.8 + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4: Let's compute that.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: (0.6944)^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.09645.

Add 0.8: 0.8 + 0.09645 ≈ 0.89645.

So the term inside the brackets is [1 - 0.89645] = 0.10355.

So ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 * 0.10355

The total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no: because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_non_spotty, which is part of the star's total.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux, which is ΔF / F0.

Wait, let me think again. The star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty, and when the other hemisphere is visible, it's F_non_spotty.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when you see one hemisphere, the flux is half the total without any spots. Because without spots, the total flux is 4πR² σ T^4, and when you see a hemisphere, it's 2π R² σ T^4.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me approach this differently.

The star's flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = 2π R² [0.8 σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 ].

So the maximum flux (F_max) is F_non_spotty, and the minimum flux (F_min) is F_spotty.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

So the relative change is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Alternatively, the dip is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_non_spotty, so the brightness variation is the difference between F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

So, the amplitude of the variation is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Let me compute this ratio.

The ratio is [ F_non_spotty - F_spotty ] / F_non_spotty

= [ (2π R² σ 6000^4 ) - (2π R² [0.8 σ 6000^4 + 0.2 σ 5000^4 ]) ] / (2π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator:

2π R² σ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 2π R² σ 0.2 (5000^4) )

= 2π R² σ 6000^4 * 0.2 - 2π R² σ 0.2 *5000^4

Factor out 0.2 * 2π R² σ:

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 - 5000^4 * 1 ]

Wait, no, not exactly. Because 5000^4 is multiplied by 0.2 in the second term. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out 2π R² σ 6000^4 from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2π R² σ [6000^4 (1) - 6000^4 (0.8) - 5000^4 (0.2) ]

= 2π R² σ [6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 5000^4 (0.2) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

Denominator: 2π R² σ 6000^4

So the ratio becomes [0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ]

The 2π R² σ cancels out, so:

0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

Let me compute (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296 - 625) e12 = 671e12.

Divide by 6000^4: 671e12 / 1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5179.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.5179 * 0.2 ≈ 0.10358.

So the relative variation is about 10.358%.

So, the brightness variation amplitude due to the spots is approximately 10.36%.

Now, the question is, what radius of a planet would cause the same amplitude when transiting the star?

The transit-induced brightness dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10358.

Take the square root: Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10358) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. 0.10358 is a bit higher, so sqrt would be approximately 0.3218.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → around 0.39, which is a bit higher.

B) ~0.07 → too low.

C) ~0.11 → too low.

D) ~0.32 → close to 0.3218.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of the relative flux variation. Because I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: The star's total luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the flux from the non-spotty regions and the spotty regions on that hemisphere.

The non-spotty part of the hemisphere is 80% of its area, so 0.8 * (2π R²) * σ Teff^4. Wait, no, the non-spotty part is 80% of the hemisphere, so 0.8 * 2π R², each point emitting σ*(6000)^4. The spotty part is 0.2 * 2π R², each emitting σ*(5000)^4.

So the total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

Which can be written as F_spotty = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

The total flux when non-spotty is visible is F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the variation is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

Then, the relative change is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

= [0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify: 0.2*(6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

As before, (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 ≈ 0.5179.

So 0.2 * 0.5179 ≈ 0.10358, or about 10.36% relative change.

So the dip is about 10.36% of the maximum flux.

Which is the same as the planet's transit dip. So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10358.

Square root: Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So option D is correct.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's spotty hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, at 5000 K. The brightness variation arises due to the rotational modulation of the star, where the spotty hemisphere alternates between being visible and hidden. This variation can resemble the dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star.

### Step 1: Brightness variation due to the spots
The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the non-spotty regions (80% of the hemisphere) and the spotty regions (20% of the hemisphere). The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = 2\pi R^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right]
\]

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2\pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
\]

The brightness variation amplitude is the relative change in flux between these two scenarios:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \frac{0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4}{(6000)^4}
\]

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \right]
\]

### Step 2: Compute the relative flux change
The term \(\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\) is calculated as:

\[
\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
\]

Substituting:

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 \right]
\]

\[
\Delta F = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355
\]

Thus, the relative brightness variation amplitude is approximately 10.36%.

### Step 3: Relate the amplitude to the exoplanet's radius
The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:

\[
\Delta F = \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]

Setting this equal to the brightness variation caused by the spots:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10358
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10358} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \(0.3218\) is:

**D) ~0.32**

### Final Answer:
Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The scenario is that when the star rotates, spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. These variations can look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

So, when an exoplanet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The goal here is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip from the planet equals the dip from the spots.

Wait, but wait. The spots themselves cause a variation. So first, I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots and then set that equal to the variation caused by a planet and solve for Rpl.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

First, the brightness variation caused by the exoplanet when it transits the star is well-known. The formula for the relative change in brightness (ΔF) during transit is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because when the planet covers a fraction A of the star's disk, the dip is proportional to (A/(π Rstar²)) * (π Rpl²) ), which simplifies to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the star's brightness isn't uniform because parts are covered by spots. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and the observed brightness changes because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light.

So, to calculate the variation in brightness due to the spots, I need to compute the difference in flux when the spots are facing us versus when they're not.

The star's total flux when all spots are on the visible side would be the sum of the flux from the non-spotty areas and the spotty areas.

Wait, let me clarify: The star is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%—so 20% of that hemisphere's surface is spots, and 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is completely normal.

When the star rotates, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. Suppose the star is rotating such that the spotty hemisphere is the one we observe when the star is at a certain point in its rotation. Wait no, wait, actually, the star's rotation would cause different parts to come into view. So perhaps the spotty hemisphere is the one we're looking at when the spots are in the direction of the observer. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the star is such that one hemisphere is entirely spotted (but only 20% filled), and the other is spot-free. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when it's the other hemisphere, we don't.

But no, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, does that mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered in spots, or that 20% of each hemisphere is covered? No, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of the spots is 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots in that hemisphere. So in the hemisphere with spots, 20% is spots, and 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is completely normal. So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere area.

So the star's total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere area is 2πR². So the spotty hemisphere has 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of spots. The other hemisphere is 2πR², all normal.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux we receive is the flux from 0.8 * 2πR² (non-spots) plus 0.2 * 2πR² (spots). Wait, no: the spotty hemisphere has 20% spots, so 80% normal. So the flux from the spotty side when it's facing us is 0.8*(normal flux per unit area) * 2πR² + 0.2*(spot flux per unit area) * 2πR².

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR² * σTeff^4.

But when spots are present, the flux is a bit less. Let's compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible, and when the other hemisphere is visible.

Wait, the star is a sphere, and when viewed from Earth, only the front hemisphere is visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots and normal areas. When it's the other hemisphere, we don't see any spots.

So the two scenarios are:

1. Spotty hemisphere is visible.

   The flux from the spotty hemisphere is: (0.8 * F_normal + 0.2 * F_spots) * (2πR²/4πR²) ) * 4πR²? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fraction of the star's surface that's emitting normally or less.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it isn't.

First, the total flux without spots is F0 = 4πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the front surface area is 2πR². Of that, 20% is spots at 5000K, and 80% is normal at 6000K.

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * (σ*(6000)^4) * 2πR²) + (0.2 * (σ*(5000)^4) * 2πR²)

The other hemisphere (non-spotty) contributes nothing because it's on the back.

Wait, no, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is not visible. So the total flux is just F_spotty.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, it's all normal, so the flux is F_non_spotty = 2πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

So the flux variation is the difference between F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

Wait, no. The star's rotation will cause different parts to come into view. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_non_spotty.

So, the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is visible. The change in flux (ΔF) would be F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Wait, but the star has two hemispheres: when one is spotty, the other is normal. So when the star is viewed from Earth, which hemisphere we see depends on its rotation. The brightness variation amplitude is the difference between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

So, let's compute F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

F_non_spotty = 2πR² * σ*(6000)^4

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2πR²) * σ*(6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2πR²) * σ*(5000)^4

So the flux difference is ΔF = F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Let me compute this.

First, let's compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4

F_spotty = 2π R² [ 0.8 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * σ (5000)^4 ]

So ΔF = F_non_spotty - F_spotty

= 2π R² σ (6000)^4 [1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Wait, let's factor out 2π R² σ (6000)^4 from both terms.

ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 [ 1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Compute the term inside the brackets:

0.8 + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4: Let's compute that.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: (0.6944)^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.09645.

Add 0.8: 0.8 + 0.09645 ≈ 0.89645.

So the term inside the brackets is [1 - 0.89645] = 0.10355.

So ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 * 0.10355

The total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no: because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_non_spotty, which is part of the star's total.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux, which is ΔF / F0.

Wait, let me think again. The star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty, and when the other hemisphere is visible, it's F_non_spotty.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when you see one hemisphere, the flux is half the total without any spots. Because without spots, the total flux is 4πR² σ T^4, and when you see a hemisphere, it's 2π R² σ T^4.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me approach this differently.

The star's flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = 2π R² [0.8 σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 ].

So the maximum flux (F_max) is F_non_spotty, and the minimum flux (F_min) is F_spotty.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

So the relative change is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Alternatively, the dip is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_non_spotty, so the brightness variation is the difference between F_non_spotty and F_spotty.

So, the amplitude of the variation is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Let me compute this ratio.

The ratio is [ F_non_spotty - F_spotty ] / F_non_spotty

= [ (2π R² σ 6000^4 ) - (2π R² [0.8 σ 6000^4 + 0.2 σ 5000^4 ]) ] / (2π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator:

2π R² σ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 2π R² σ 0.2 (5000^4) )

= 2π R² σ 6000^4 * 0.2 - 2π R² σ 0.2 *5000^4

Factor out 0.2 * 2π R² σ:

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 - 5000^4 * 1 ]

Wait, no, not exactly. Because 5000^4 is multiplied by 0.2 in the second term. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out 2π R² σ 6000^4 from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2π R² σ [6000^4 (1) - 6000^4 (0.8) - 5000^4 (0.2) ]

= 2π R² σ [6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 5000^4 (0.2) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

Denominator: 2π R² σ 6000^4

So the ratio becomes [0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ]

The 2π R² σ cancels out, so:

0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

Let me compute (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296 - 625) e12 = 671e12.

Divide by 6000^4: 671e12 / 1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5179.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.5179 * 0.2 ≈ 0.10358.

So the relative variation is about 10.358%.

So, the brightness variation amplitude due to the spots is approximately 10.36%.

Now, the question is, what radius of a planet would cause the same amplitude when transiting the star?

The transit-induced brightness dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10358.

Take the square root: Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10358) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. 0.10358 is a bit higher, so sqrt would be approximately 0.3218.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → around 0.39, which is a bit higher.

B) ~0.07 → too low.

C) ~0.11 → too low.

D) ~0.32 → close to 0.3218.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of the relative flux variation. Because I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: The star's total luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the flux from the non-spotty regions and the spotty regions on that hemisphere.

The non-spotty part of the hemisphere is 80% of its area, so 0.8 * (2π R²) * σ Teff^4. Wait, no, the non-spotty part is 80% of the hemisphere, so 0.8 * 2π R², each point emitting σ*(6000)^4. The spotty part is 0.2 * 2π R², each emitting σ*(5000)^4.

So the total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

Which can be written as F_spotty = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

The total flux when non-spotty is visible is F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the variation is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

Then, the relative change is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

= [0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify: 0.2*(6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

As before, (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 ≈ 0.5179.

So 0.2 * 0.5179 ≈ 0.10358, or about 10.36% relative change.

So the dip is about 10.36% of the maximum flux.

Which is the same as the planet's transit dip. So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10358.

Square root: Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So option D is correct.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's spotty hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, at 5000 K. The brightness variation arises due to the rotational modulation of the star, where the spotty hemisphere alternates between being visible and hidden. This variation can resemble the dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star.

### Step 1: Brightness variation due to the spots
The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the non-spotty regions (80% of the hemisphere) and the spotty regions (20% of the hemisphere). The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = 2\pi R^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right]
\]

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2\pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
\]

The brightness variation amplitude is the relative change in flux between these two scenarios:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \frac{0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4}{(6000)^4}
\]

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \right]
\]

### Step 2: Compute the relative flux change
The term \(\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\) is calculated as:

\[
\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
\]

Substituting:

\[
\Delta F = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 \right]
\]

\[
\Delta F = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355
\]

Thus, the relative brightness variation amplitude is approximately 10.36%.

### Step 3: Relate the amplitude to the exoplanet's radius
The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:

\[
\Delta F = \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]

Setting this equal to the brightness variation caused by the spots:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10358
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10358} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \(0.3218\) is:

**D) ~0.32**

### Final Answer:
Answer: D
