Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to bring charges together or something like that.

So, the setup: there's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. I'm placing a charge q at a distance d from the center of this sphere. I need to find the potential energy of the system. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, since the sphere is grounded, that probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it can flow away. But in this case, what's the charge on the sphere? Hmm, when you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will induce charges. But since it's grounded, the conductor's potential is zero. Oh right, because being grounded means it's at the same potential as Earth, which is taken as zero.

So, when we place charge q at distance d from the center of the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But wait, because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. So, the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must sum to zero at the sphere's surface.

Let me think about the charges. The conducting sphere is neutral to start with. When you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's electrons will redistribute. If q is positive, the sphere's electrons (negative charges) will be attracted to the near side, and perhaps some positive charges will be induced on the far side. Wait, no, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge can't build up; instead, the sphere's charge adjusts so that its potential is zero.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor. So the induced charges will reside on the surface. The sphere's own charge plus the induced charges must satisfy that its surface potential is zero. But how do I model this?

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of image charges. I've heard about the method of image charges for solving problems involving grounded spheres. Let me recall. For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the charge q outside the sphere has an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge would be such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the setup is similar to a point charge outside a conducting sphere. The image charge q' is placed such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The image charge is inside the sphere, right?

The formula for the image charge when the sphere is grounded is q' = - (R/d) q, where d is the distance from the charge q to the center of the sphere, and R is the radius. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I think the image charge magnitude is q multiplied by some factor related to R and d.

Wait, the image charge method says that the induced charge on the sphere can be found by considering an image charge inside the sphere. If the sphere is grounded, then the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the image charge q' should cancel at the surface.

Let me model this. The potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q would be V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point. The potential due to the image charge q' would be V_q' = k q' / r', where r' is the distance from q' to the same point.

But since the sphere is a conductor, all points on its surface are at the same potential. For the potential to be zero, the sum of V_q and V_q' must be zero at every point on the sphere's surface. That can only happen if the image charge q' is placed symmetrically opposite to q with respect to the sphere's center.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the location of the image charge. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, and its position is determined such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero. So, if the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge's distance from the center would be along the same line, but inside, so distance x from the center. Let me denote x as the distance from the sphere's center to the image charge. So, the image charge is at x = (R^2)/d. Wait, I think that's the case when the sphere is ungrounded. Wait, no, I might be mixing up the cases.

Wait, for a conducting sphere not connected to ground, the image charge would be q' = - (q R^2)/(d^2) ) * d? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by (R/d) times the charge, but maybe negative. Let me think: the image charge for a grounded sphere would be such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The point charge q is outside, so the method of images would place an image charge q' inside the sphere. The potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface must sum to zero.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / L, where L is the distance from q to that surface point. Similarly, the potential due to q' is V_q' = k q' / l, where l is the distance from q' to that point.

But all points on the sphere are equidistant from the center, so perhaps the image charge's position is such that the potentials cancel. Let me think about the line connecting the charge q and the sphere's center.

Let me say that the charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' would be located on the same line, at a distance x from the center towards the charge. So the distance between q and q' would be d - x. Or wait, no, because if the sphere is at center O, and q is at point P outside, then the image charge q' would be at point P', inside the sphere, such that OP' = (R^2)/d. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think for a grounded sphere, the image charge is located at a distance x from the center such that x = R^2 / d. So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at position x = RÂ²/d. And the image charge has magnitude q' = - q (R/d). Hmm, I think that's how it goes.

Wait, because when d is much larger than R, the image charge would be very close to the center because x approaches zero as d becomes large. But wait, I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the potential energy by considering the work done in bringing the charge q and the induced charges into place.

Wait, but the conducting sphere is initially neutral. The charge q is placed outside, and the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would adjust so that the sphere's potential is zero.

So, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Hmm, but since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the location of q (distance d from the center) is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. Wait, but the sphere's induced charges would create a potential at that point. So the potential energy U would be the charge q multiplied by that potential.

Wait, but the induced charges are -q', or something like that. Hmm, maybe I can model this.

The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Let me denote the total induced charge on the sphere as Q. But wait, the sphere is a conductor and is grounded. So when you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at any point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to q and the induced charges. Wait, no, the sphere's potential is the sum of the potentials due to all charges, including q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. Because the sphere itself is at zero potential, so the potential at q's location would be V = V_sphere + V_q. But wait, no, that's not right because V_sphere includes the potential due to all charges, including q. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me take another approach. The potential energy U of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So when we bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, the work done is equal to the charge q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges except q itself.

But in this case, the other charges are the induced charges on the sphere. So, U would be q * V_induced.

Alternatively, maybe it's the potential due to the induced charges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere would create a potential at point q's location. Let me think about that potential. Let me denote the total induced charge on the sphere as Q. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at a point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to all charges. So, the potential at the point where q is located (distance d from center) is the potential due to Q and due to q itself. But the potential due to the sphere's charge Q at point d would be V = k Q / d.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at the surface is zero. The potential at the surface is due to both Q and q. So, V_surface = V_Q + V_q = 0.

But the sphere's own potential due to Q is zero because it's a conductor. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges reside on the surface. The potential on the surface due to the induced charges is zero, but that's not considering the external charge q. Hmm, no, because the external charge q also contributes to the potential on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface must be zero. So, the potential at the surface due to all charges (including q) is zero. So, V_surface = (k Q)/R + (k q) / r = 0, where r is the distance from q to the point on the sphere's surface.

But how do I find Q and the potential elsewhere? Let me think. Let's model the sphere as having an induced charge Q. Then, the potential at any point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to Q and q.

But the sphere's surface must be at zero potential. So, at a point on the sphere's surface, say a distance R from the center, the potential is:

V = (k Q)/R + (k q)/(distance between q and that point on the sphere)

Hmm, the distance between q and the point on the sphere's surface varies depending on where the point is. But since the sphere is symmetric, perhaps the potential due to q on the sphere's surface can be averaged.

Wait, but actually, for a point charge outside a sphere, the potential on the sphere's surface is not uniform, but for a conducting sphere, the charges adjust so that the potential is uniform. So, perhaps we can model the situation by considering the potential due to q at the center of the sphere, and then using that to find the induced charges.

Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of image charges. So, the image charge q' is placed inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' cancels on the sphere's surface.

So, for any point on the sphere's surface, the potential due to q and q' must sum to zero. So, imagine a point on the sphere's surface along the line connecting the sphere's center and the charge q. Let's say that point is at a distance R from the center, so the distance from q to that point is d - (d - R) ? Wait, no, if the center is O, and q is at point P, then the point on the sphere's surface along OP is at a distance d - (d - R) = R from O. Wait, no, the distance from q to the point on the surface would be (d - (d - R))? No, perhaps I should model it as the point on the sphere's surface being at a distance of d + R? Wait, no, that's only if q is outside the sphere. Wait, if q is at distance d from O, and the sphere has radius R, then the point on the sphere in the same direction as q would be at a distance d - R from q. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if d > R, then the point on the sphere is closer to q by (d - R). Oh, wait, no: the distance from q to the point on the sphere along the same line is (d - R), because the point is (d - (d - R))? Hmm, perhaps a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to visualize.

Wait, O is the center of the sphere, radius R. Charge q is at point P, a distance d from O. The closest point on the sphere to q is point S, at a distance R. So the distance from q to S is (d - R). But wait, that's only if d > R. If d < R, then S would be on the opposite side. But in our case, since q is placed at a distance d away, which I think is greater than R because otherwise the charge would be inside the sphere, which isn't the case here.

So, for the point on the sphere in the same direction as q, the distance is (d - R). So, the potential at that point due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R). The potential due to the image charge q' is V_q' = k q' / (R + x), where x is the distance from the sphere's center to the image charge. Wait, no, because the image charge would be inside the sphere, so the point on the sphere is R away from the center, so the distance from q' to that point would be R - x, if q' is at a distance x from the center towards q.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as: the image charge is placed at a distance x from the center, along the same line as q, so the distance from q to the image charge is (d - x). The potential at the point S (on the sphere's surface) due to q is V1 = k q / (d - R). The potential due to q' is V2 = k q' / (R - x), because q' is at x from the center, and S is at R from the center, so the distance between q' and S is (R - x). Wait, no, if x is between O and S (since q' is inside the sphere), then the distance between q' and S is (R - x). But if x is on the opposite side of the center from q, then the distance would be (R + x), but I think in this scenario the image charge is on the same side as q.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or approach that I remember.

Wait, I recall that for a point charge outside a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy of the system is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 (R^2) / (d^2 - R^2). Hmm, but wait, that doesn't look exactly like any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²). That seems close to what I was thinking.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded sphere is U = - (k qÂ² RÂ²) / (2 (dÂ² - RÂ²)).

Wait, that would match option C.

So, how do I derive that? Let's think.

The potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges must be such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

The induced charge Q on the sphere can be found using the method of images. As I thought earlier, the image charge q' is located inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the image charge q' is at a distance x from the center, and its magnitude is such that:

k q/(d - R) + k q'/(R - x) = 0.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the image charge's position. Alternatively, maybe the image charge is located such that the potential due to q and q' at any point on the sphere's surface is zero. That would imply that the image charge is located at a specific distance from the center.

Wait, I think the image charge's position is determined such that the potential at the sphere's surface cancels. So, the image charge is at a distance x from the center along the same line as q. Then, for any point on the sphere's surface, the potentials due to q and q' must cancel.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the induced charge Q, which is the charge on the sphere. Then, the potential energy would be the work done to bring q to its position, which is the product of q and the potential at that point due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere being grounded complicates things. Let me try that approach.

When the charge q is brought to distance d from the sphere, the sphere will have an induced charge Q, which is the total charge on the sphere. Because the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero, which gives us an equation involving Q and q.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to both q and Q must be zero. So, the potential due to q at a point on the sphere's surface (say, the closest point) is V_q = k q/(d - R). The potential due to Q at that point is V_Q = k Q / R.

But since the total potential must be zero, V_q + V_Q = 0 â k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0 â Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

But wait, the sphere is neutral when isolated. When we bring a charge q near it, the induced charge would be such that the net charge is zero? No, wait, because the sphere is grounded. So any induced charges can leave the sphere, but wait no, the sphere is a conductor, so if it's grounded, any induced charges can move to ground, but in this case, the charge on the sphere must be such that the surface potential is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The sphere is initially neutral. When a charge q is placed at a distance d, the sphere induces charges. The sphere being grounded means that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the surface is due to all charges, including q and the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to all charges (including q) is zero. Therefore, the sum of potentials due to q and the induced charges must be zero.

But the sphere's induced charges have a potential at the surface given by V_Q = k Q / R, where Q is the total induced charge on the sphere. The potential due to q at the same point is V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point.

Wait, but the point on the sphere's surface closest to q is at a distance (d - R) from q, because the sphere's radius is R. So, r = d - R. So the potential due to q at that point is V_q = k q / (d - R).

So, the total potential at that point is V = V_q + V_Q = 0 â k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0 â Q = - (q R) / (d - R).

Hmm, that gives the induced charge Q. But wait, because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charge would be Q = - (q R) / (d - R).

Now, to find the potential energy of the system. The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So, when I bring q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, the work done is the charge q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges, which in this case is the induced charge Q on the sphere.

Wait, but the potential at point d (where q is placed) due to Q would be V_Q = k Q / d, because the distance from Q (on the sphere) to q's position is d.

So, U = q * V_Q = q * (k Q / d).

But we found Q = - (q R)/(d - R). Substituting:

U = q * [k * (- q R/(d - R)) ) / d ]

Simplify:

U = - (k q^2 R) / [d (d - R)].

But wait, looking at the options, none of them exactly match this expression. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²)

Option B: U = -k qÂ² d/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Option C: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Option D: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² R/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Hmm, my expression is - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Wait, let me factor d - R as (d^2 - R^2)/(d + R). So,

U = - k q^2 R / [d * (d - R) ) ] = - k q^2 R [ d (d^2 - R^2)/(d + R) ) ].

Wait, no, maybe I can write it as:

d (d - R) = d^2 - d R.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, the induced charge is Q, so U = k q Q / d.

Wait, but I have Q = - (q R)/(d - R). So,

U = k q * (- q R/(d - R)) / d = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential energy. Because the induced charge on the sphere is Q, but the system's potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges q and Q, which would involve both the work to bring q and then to bring Q. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the induced charge Q doesn't contribute to the potential energy because it's considered to be in a fixed potential (grounded). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the work done to bring charge q to its position, and the work done to bring the induced charge Q onto the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so the work done to bring Q would be zero.

Wait, but that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is only the work done to bring q, considering the potential created by the sphere. But the sphere's potential is zero, so perhaps the potential energy is the work done by q in moving against the potential created by the induced charges.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the potential energy being equal to the energy stored in the electric field between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when you bring the charge q near the grounded sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on its surface is zero. The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges.

So,

U = q * V_induced,

where V_induced is the potential at the point where q is placed due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charges Q on the sphere produce a potential at distance d from the center. The potential due to a spherical charge Q at a distance d is V = k Q / d.

From earlier, Q = - (q R)/(d - R). So,

V_induced = k Q / d = k (- q R)/(d (d - R)).

So,

U = q * V_induced = q * [ -k q R/(d (d - R)) ] = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

But looking at the options, none match this exactly. Let me check if I can express this in terms of the options.

Wait, d (d - R) is dÂ² - d R. Hmm, but none of the options have this denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q. Let me re-examine that.

We have the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential there is due to the charge q and the induced charge Q.

The potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q is k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point. The point on the sphere's surface closest to q is at a distance (d - R) from q, so V_q = k q/(d - R).

The potential due to Q at that point is V_Q = k Q/R.

So, V_q + V_Q = 0 â Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

Wait, that's correct. So, Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

So, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q to its position, which is q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges, which is V_induced = V_Q = k Q / d.

Wait, because the induced charge Q is on the sphere, the potential at distance d due to Q is V = k Q/d.

So,

U = q * (k Q / d) = q * [ k (- q R)/(d (d - R)) ) ] = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them match this. Let me check the options again.

Option C is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²).

Wait, let me factor the denominator in my U expression:

d (d - R) = d^2 - d R.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the method. Maybe the potential energy should account for the self-energy of the induced charges as well, but that seems unlikely since the sphere is conducting.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the same as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges don't contribute to the potential energy because they are at zero potential.

Wait, but that can't be right because the induced charges must interact with q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field due to q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside is uniform, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the problem in terms of capacitance.

The conducting sphere can be considered as a capacitor. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charge would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The capacitance of a sphere is C = 4 Ï Îµâ R. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, but the potential energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential difference across the capacitor. But in this case, the sphere's potential is zero, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the method of images again. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the potential energy is the interaction between q and q'.

The image charge q' is given by q' = - (R^2/d) q.

Wait, I think that's correct. So the image charge is located at a distance x = R^2/d from the center, on the same line as q.

So, the potential energy between q and q' would be U = k q q' / (d - x), where x is the distance of the image charge from q.

Wait, no, because the image charge is inside the sphere, the distance between q and q' is d - x, since x is the distance from the center to q'.

So, x = RÂ²/d. So, the distance between q and q' is (d - x) = d - (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d.

So, the potential energy U is the energy of the system q and q', which is:

U = (1/2) k q q' / (distance between them).

Wait, no, because the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So,

q' = - (RÂ²/d) q.

So,

U = k * q * (- RÂ² q/d) / ( (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d )

Let me compute this:

U = k q (- RÂ² q/d) * d/(dÂ² - RÂ²) )

The d in the numerator and denominator cancel:

U = - k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²).

But wait, the factor is 1/2 because when you bring two charges together, you account for the work done once, not twice. Or is it because the image charge is considered as a part of the system?

Wait, in the method of images, the potential energy is calculated as half the energy of the real charge and the image charge. Because the image charge is a mathematical construct, and the real energy is half of the sum of the interactions. So,

U = (1/2) * [k q q' / r].

So, substituting q' = - RÂ² q/d and r = (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d,

U = (1/2) * [k q * (- RÂ² q/d) ] / [ (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d ]

Simplify the denominator:

Dividing by (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d is the same as multiplying by d/(dÂ² - RÂ²).

So,

U = (1/2) * [ -k qÂ² RÂ² / d ] * [ d / (dÂ² - RÂ²) ) ]

The d's cancel:

U = (1/2) * [ -k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²)

Which matches option C.

So the correct answer is C.

To calculate the net potential energy of the system when a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. The grounded sphere ensures that its surface potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere adjust to satisfy this condition.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Image Charge Method**:  
   When a charge \( q \) is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere, an image charge \( q' \) is induced inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere along the line connecting \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \).

2. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). The potential energy is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{\text{distance between } q \text{ and } q'}
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and the distance, we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option C**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced image charge on the grounded sphere. Using the method of image charges and accounting for the symmetry of the problem, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to bring charges together or something like that.

So, the setup: there's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. I'm placing a charge q at a distance d from the center of this sphere. I need to find the potential energy of the system. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, since the sphere is grounded, that probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it can flow away. But in this case, what's the charge on the sphere? Hmm, when you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will induce charges. But since it's grounded, the conductor's potential is zero. Oh right, because being grounded means it's at the same potential as Earth, which is taken as zero.

So, when we place charge q at distance d from the center of the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But wait, because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. So, the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must sum to zero at the sphere's surface.

Let me think about the charges. The conducting sphere is neutral to start with. When you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's electrons will redistribute. If q is positive, the sphere's electrons (negative charges) will be attracted to the near side, and perhaps some positive charges will be induced on the far side. Wait, no, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge can't build up; instead, the sphere's charge adjusts so that its potential is zero.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor. So the induced charges will reside on the surface. The sphere's own charge plus the induced charges must satisfy that its surface potential is zero. But how do I model this?

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of image charges. I've heard about the method of image charges for solving problems involving grounded spheres. Let me recall. For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the charge q outside the sphere has an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge would be such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the setup is similar to a point charge outside a conducting sphere. The image charge q' is placed such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The image charge is inside the sphere, right?

The formula for the image charge when the sphere is grounded is q' = - (R/d) q, where d is the distance from the charge q to the center of the sphere, and R is the radius. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I think the image charge magnitude is q multiplied by some factor related to R and d.

Wait, the image charge method says that the induced charge on the sphere can be found by considering an image charge inside the sphere. If the sphere is grounded, then the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the image charge q' should cancel at the surface.

Let me model this. The potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q would be V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point. The potential due to the image charge q' would be V_q' = k q' / r', where r' is the distance from q' to the same point.

But since the sphere is a conductor, all points on its surface are at the same potential. For the potential to be zero, the sum of V_q and V_q' must be zero at every point on the sphere's surface. That can only happen if the image charge q' is placed symmetrically opposite to q with respect to the sphere's center.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the location of the image charge. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, and its position is determined such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero. So, if the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge's distance from the center would be along the same line, but inside, so distance x from the center. Let me denote x as the distance from the sphere's center to the image charge. So, the image charge is at x = (R^2)/d. Wait, I think that's the case when the sphere is ungrounded. Wait, no, I might be mixing up the cases.

Wait, for a conducting sphere not connected to ground, the image charge would be q' = - (q R^2)/(d^2) ) * d? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by (R/d) times the charge, but maybe negative. Let me think: the image charge for a grounded sphere would be such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The point charge q is outside, so the method of images would place an image charge q' inside the sphere. The potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface must sum to zero.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / L, where L is the distance from q to that surface point. Similarly, the potential due to q' is V_q' = k q' / l, where l is the distance from q' to that point.

But all points on the sphere are equidistant from the center, so perhaps the image charge's position is such that the potentials cancel. Let me think about the line connecting the charge q and the sphere's center.

Let me say that the charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' would be located on the same line, at a distance x from the center towards the charge. So the distance between q and q' would be d - x. Or wait, no, because if the sphere is at center O, and q is at point P outside, then the image charge q' would be at point P', inside the sphere, such that OP' = (R^2)/d. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think for a grounded sphere, the image charge is located at a distance x from the center such that x = R^2 / d. So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at position x = RÂ²/d. And the image charge has magnitude q' = - q (R/d). Hmm, I think that's how it goes.

Wait, because when d is much larger than R, the image charge would be very close to the center because x approaches zero as d becomes large. But wait, I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the potential energy by considering the work done in bringing the charge q and the induced charges into place.

Wait, but the conducting sphere is initially neutral. The charge q is placed outside, and the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would adjust so that the sphere's potential is zero.

So, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Hmm, but since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the location of q (distance d from the center) is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. Wait, but the sphere's induced charges would create a potential at that point. So the potential energy U would be the charge q multiplied by that potential.

Wait, but the induced charges are -q', or something like that. Hmm, maybe I can model this.

The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Let me denote the total induced charge on the sphere as Q. But wait, the sphere is a conductor and is grounded. So when you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at any point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to q and the induced charges. Wait, no, the sphere's potential is the sum of the potentials due to all charges, including q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. Because the sphere itself is at zero potential, so the potential at q's location would be V = V_sphere + V_q. But wait, no, that's not right because V_sphere includes the potential due to all charges, including q. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me take another approach. The potential energy U of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So when we bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, the work done is equal to the charge q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges except q itself.

But in this case, the other charges are the induced charges on the sphere. So, U would be q * V_induced.

Alternatively, maybe it's the potential due to the induced charges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere would create a potential at point q's location. Let me think about that potential. Let me denote the total induced charge on the sphere as Q. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at a point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to all charges. So, the potential at the point where q is located (distance d from center) is the potential due to Q and due to q itself. But the potential due to the sphere's charge Q at point d would be V = k Q / d.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at the surface is zero. The potential at the surface is due to both Q and q. So, V_surface = V_Q + V_q = 0.

But the sphere's own potential due to Q is zero because it's a conductor. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges reside on the surface. The potential on the surface due to the induced charges is zero, but that's not considering the external charge q. Hmm, no, because the external charge q also contributes to the potential on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface must be zero. So, the potential at the surface due to all charges (including q) is zero. So, V_surface = (k Q)/R + (k q) / r = 0, where r is the distance from q to the point on the sphere's surface.

But how do I find Q and the potential elsewhere? Let me think. Let's model the sphere as having an induced charge Q. Then, the potential at any point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to Q and q.

But the sphere's surface must be at zero potential. So, at a point on the sphere's surface, say a distance R from the center, the potential is:

V = (k Q)/R + (k q)/(distance between q and that point on the sphere)

Hmm, the distance between q and the point on the sphere's surface varies depending on where the point is. But since the sphere is symmetric, perhaps the potential due to q on the sphere's surface can be averaged.

Wait, but actually, for a point charge outside a sphere, the potential on the sphere's surface is not uniform, but for a conducting sphere, the charges adjust so that the potential is uniform. So, perhaps we can model the situation by considering the potential due to q at the center of the sphere, and then using that to find the induced charges.

Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of image charges. So, the image charge q' is placed inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' cancels on the sphere's surface.

So, for any point on the sphere's surface, the potential due to q and q' must sum to zero. So, imagine a point on the sphere's surface along the line connecting the sphere's center and the charge q. Let's say that point is at a distance R from the center, so the distance from q to that point is d - (d - R) ? Wait, no, if the center is O, and q is at point P, then the point on the sphere's surface along OP is at a distance d - (d - R) = R from O. Wait, no, the distance from q to the point on the surface would be (d - (d - R))? No, perhaps I should model it as the point on the sphere's surface being at a distance of d + R? Wait, no, that's only if q is outside the sphere. Wait, if q is at distance d from O, and the sphere has radius R, then the point on the sphere in the same direction as q would be at a distance d - R from q. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if d > R, then the point on the sphere is closer to q by (d - R). Oh, wait, no: the distance from q to the point on the sphere along the same line is (d - R), because the point is (d - (d - R))? Hmm, perhaps a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to visualize.

Wait, O is the center of the sphere, radius R. Charge q is at point P, a distance d from O. The closest point on the sphere to q is point S, at a distance R. So the distance from q to S is (d - R). But wait, that's only if d > R. If d < R, then S would be on the opposite side. But in our case, since q is placed at a distance d away, which I think is greater than R because otherwise the charge would be inside the sphere, which isn't the case here.

So, for the point on the sphere in the same direction as q, the distance is (d - R). So, the potential at that point due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R). The potential due to the image charge q' is V_q' = k q' / (R + x), where x is the distance from the sphere's center to the image charge. Wait, no, because the image charge would be inside the sphere, so the point on the sphere is R away from the center, so the distance from q' to that point would be R - x, if q' is at a distance x from the center towards q.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as: the image charge is placed at a distance x from the center, along the same line as q, so the distance from q to the image charge is (d - x). The potential at the point S (on the sphere's surface) due to q is V1 = k q / (d - R). The potential due to q' is V2 = k q' / (R - x), because q' is at x from the center, and S is at R from the center, so the distance between q' and S is (R - x). Wait, no, if x is between O and S (since q' is inside the sphere), then the distance between q' and S is (R - x). But if x is on the opposite side of the center from q, then the distance would be (R + x), but I think in this scenario the image charge is on the same side as q.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or approach that I remember.

Wait, I recall that for a point charge outside a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy of the system is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 (R^2) / (d^2 - R^2). Hmm, but wait, that doesn't look exactly like any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²). That seems close to what I was thinking.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded sphere is U = - (k qÂ² RÂ²) / (2 (dÂ² - RÂ²)).

Wait, that would match option C.

So, how do I derive that? Let's think.

The potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges must be such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

The induced charge Q on the sphere can be found using the method of images. As I thought earlier, the image charge q' is located inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the image charge q' is at a distance x from the center, and its magnitude is such that:

k q/(d - R) + k q'/(R - x) = 0.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the image charge's position. Alternatively, maybe the image charge is located such that the potential due to q and q' at any point on the sphere's surface is zero. That would imply that the image charge is located at a specific distance from the center.

Wait, I think the image charge's position is determined such that the potential at the sphere's surface cancels. So, the image charge is at a distance x from the center along the same line as q. Then, for any point on the sphere's surface, the potentials due to q and q' must cancel.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the induced charge Q, which is the charge on the sphere. Then, the potential energy would be the work done to bring q to its position, which is the product of q and the potential at that point due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere being grounded complicates things. Let me try that approach.

When the charge q is brought to distance d from the sphere, the sphere will have an induced charge Q, which is the total charge on the sphere. Because the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero, which gives us an equation involving Q and q.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to both q and Q must be zero. So, the potential due to q at a point on the sphere's surface (say, the closest point) is V_q = k q/(d - R). The potential due to Q at that point is V_Q = k Q / R.

But since the total potential must be zero, V_q + V_Q = 0 â k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0 â Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

But wait, the sphere is neutral when isolated. When we bring a charge q near it, the induced charge would be such that the net charge is zero? No, wait, because the sphere is grounded. So any induced charges can leave the sphere, but wait no, the sphere is a conductor, so if it's grounded, any induced charges can move to ground, but in this case, the charge on the sphere must be such that the surface potential is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The sphere is initially neutral. When a charge q is placed at a distance d, the sphere induces charges. The sphere being grounded means that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the surface is due to all charges, including q and the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to all charges (including q) is zero. Therefore, the sum of potentials due to q and the induced charges must be zero.

But the sphere's induced charges have a potential at the surface given by V_Q = k Q / R, where Q is the total induced charge on the sphere. The potential due to q at the same point is V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point.

Wait, but the point on the sphere's surface closest to q is at a distance (d - R) from q, because the sphere's radius is R. So, r = d - R. So the potential due to q at that point is V_q = k q / (d - R).

So, the total potential at that point is V = V_q + V_Q = 0 â k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0 â Q = - (q R) / (d - R).

Hmm, that gives the induced charge Q. But wait, because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charge would be Q = - (q R) / (d - R).

Now, to find the potential energy of the system. The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So, when I bring q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, the work done is the charge q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges, which in this case is the induced charge Q on the sphere.

Wait, but the potential at point d (where q is placed) due to Q would be V_Q = k Q / d, because the distance from Q (on the sphere) to q's position is d.

So, U = q * V_Q = q * (k Q / d).

But we found Q = - (q R)/(d - R). Substituting:

U = q * [k * (- q R/(d - R)) ) / d ]

Simplify:

U = - (k q^2 R) / [d (d - R)].

But wait, looking at the options, none of them exactly match this expression. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²)

Option B: U = -k qÂ² d/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Option C: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Option D: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² R/(dÂ² - RÂ²)

Hmm, my expression is - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Wait, let me factor d - R as (d^2 - R^2)/(d + R). So,

U = - k q^2 R / [d * (d - R) ) ] = - k q^2 R [ d (d^2 - R^2)/(d + R) ) ].

Wait, no, maybe I can write it as:

d (d - R) = d^2 - d R.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, the induced charge is Q, so U = k q Q / d.

Wait, but I have Q = - (q R)/(d - R). So,

U = k q * (- q R/(d - R)) / d = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential energy. Because the induced charge on the sphere is Q, but the system's potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges q and Q, which would involve both the work to bring q and then to bring Q. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the induced charge Q doesn't contribute to the potential energy because it's considered to be in a fixed potential (grounded). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the work done to bring charge q to its position, and the work done to bring the induced charge Q onto the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so the work done to bring Q would be zero.

Wait, but that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is only the work done to bring q, considering the potential created by the sphere. But the sphere's potential is zero, so perhaps the potential energy is the work done by q in moving against the potential created by the induced charges.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the potential energy being equal to the energy stored in the electric field between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when you bring the charge q near the grounded sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on its surface is zero. The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges.

So,

U = q * V_induced,

where V_induced is the potential at the point where q is placed due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charges Q on the sphere produce a potential at distance d from the center. The potential due to a spherical charge Q at a distance d is V = k Q / d.

From earlier, Q = - (q R)/(d - R). So,

V_induced = k Q / d = k (- q R)/(d (d - R)).

So,

U = q * V_induced = q * [ -k q R/(d (d - R)) ] = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

But looking at the options, none match this exactly. Let me check if I can express this in terms of the options.

Wait, d (d - R) is dÂ² - d R. Hmm, but none of the options have this denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q. Let me re-examine that.

We have the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential there is due to the charge q and the induced charge Q.

The potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q is k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point. The point on the sphere's surface closest to q is at a distance (d - R) from q, so V_q = k q/(d - R).

The potential due to Q at that point is V_Q = k Q/R.

So, V_q + V_Q = 0 â Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

Wait, that's correct. So, Q = - (q R)/(d - R).

So, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q to its position, which is q multiplied by the potential at that point due to all other charges, which is V_induced = V_Q = k Q / d.

Wait, because the induced charge Q is on the sphere, the potential at distance d due to Q is V = k Q/d.

So,

U = q * (k Q / d) = q * [ k (- q R)/(d (d - R)) ) ] = - (k qÂ² R) / [d (d - R)].

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them match this. Let me check the options again.

Option C is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²).

Wait, let me factor the denominator in my U expression:

d (d - R) = d^2 - d R.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the method. Maybe the potential energy should account for the self-energy of the induced charges as well, but that seems unlikely since the sphere is conducting.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the same as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges don't contribute to the potential energy because they are at zero potential.

Wait, but that can't be right because the induced charges must interact with q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field due to q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside is uniform, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the problem in terms of capacitance.

The conducting sphere can be considered as a capacitor. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charge would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The capacitance of a sphere is C = 4 Ï Îµâ R. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, but the potential energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential difference across the capacitor. But in this case, the sphere's potential is zero, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the method of images again. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the potential energy is the interaction between q and q'.

The image charge q' is given by q' = - (R^2/d) q.

Wait, I think that's correct. So the image charge is located at a distance x = R^2/d from the center, on the same line as q.

So, the potential energy between q and q' would be U = k q q' / (d - x), where x is the distance of the image charge from q.

Wait, no, because the image charge is inside the sphere, the distance between q and q' is d - x, since x is the distance from the center to q'.

So, x = RÂ²/d. So, the distance between q and q' is (d - x) = d - (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d.

So, the potential energy U is the energy of the system q and q', which is:

U = (1/2) k q q' / (distance between them).

Wait, no, because the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So,

q' = - (RÂ²/d) q.

So,

U = k * q * (- RÂ² q/d) / ( (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d )

Let me compute this:

U = k q (- RÂ² q/d) * d/(dÂ² - RÂ²) )

The d in the numerator and denominator cancel:

U = - k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²).

But wait, the factor is 1/2 because when you bring two charges together, you account for the work done once, not twice. Or is it because the image charge is considered as a part of the system?

Wait, in the method of images, the potential energy is calculated as half the energy of the real charge and the image charge. Because the image charge is a mathematical construct, and the real energy is half of the sum of the interactions. So,

U = (1/2) * [k q q' / r].

So, substituting q' = - RÂ² q/d and r = (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d,

U = (1/2) * [k q * (- RÂ² q/d) ] / [ (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d ]

Simplify the denominator:

Dividing by (dÂ² - RÂ²)/d is the same as multiplying by d/(dÂ² - RÂ²).

So,

U = (1/2) * [ -k qÂ² RÂ² / d ] * [ d / (dÂ² - RÂ²) ) ]

The d's cancel:

U = (1/2) * [ -k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

U = - (1/2) k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² - RÂ²)

Which matches option C.

So the correct answer is C.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system when a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. The grounded sphere ensures that its surface potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere adjust to satisfy this condition.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Image Charge Method**:  
   When a charge \( q \) is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere, an image charge \( q' \) is induced inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere along the line connecting \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \).

2. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). The potential energy is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{\text{distance between } q \text{ and } q'}
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and the distance, we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option C**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced image charge on the grounded sphere. Using the method of image charges and accounting for the symmetry of the problem, the correct answer is:
