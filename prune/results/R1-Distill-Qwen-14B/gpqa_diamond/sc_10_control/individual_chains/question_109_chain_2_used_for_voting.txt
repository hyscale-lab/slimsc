Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Hmm, let me think. The question is about Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Alright, let's break it down.

The system is two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So, the initial state is 1S0. The problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final state has T(NN)=0. So, I think T is the isospin, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right, isospin is a concept in particle physics where protons and neutrons are treated as two states of the same particle (the nucleon). So for two nucleons, their isospin can be either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet).

Wait, the question says the final T(NN) is 0. So the two nucleons after emission have an isospin of 0. So that must mean they are in a singlet state. Because isospin 0 implies symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, no, isospin is a separate quantum number from spin. Hmm, but Pauli's exclusion applies based on the total quantum state, which includes spin, isospin, etc.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 implies 2S+1=1 → S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, which is 0 (S-state). So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. Because J is given as 0.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN state plus X. The process should conserve angular momentum and parity.

The problem statement also says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum (S + L) plus 1 must equal T mod 2.

Wait, no, the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the NN system, S is their spin, L is their orbital angular momentum.

The initial state is 1S0, so for the initial NN state, S=0, L=0. So T_initial would be 0 + 0 +1 mod 2 =1. But wait, the initial NN state's isospin is not given. Hmm, wait, the problem says that the initial state is 1S0, which is for the bound system. But when they emit X, the final NN state has T=0. So the initial NN state may have T=1 or T=0? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says that the initial state is 1S0, but after emitting X, the NN is in a state with T=0. So the initial state's T must be determined based on the process. Or perhaps it's the initial state's T that's being considered here? No, because the problem says that the final T is 0.

Let me think. The initial state is 1S0, which is the NN bound state. So their spin S is 0, orbital L is 0, so J is 0. The isospin T for the initial state would be (S + L +1) mod 2. So S=0, L=0. So T_initial = (0 + 0 +1) mod 2 =1. So T_initial=1.

But after emitting X, the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin changes from 1 to 0. Hmm, but how does that happen? When a particle is emitted, how does isospin change? Wait, isospin is another conserved quantity, but only approximately. Alternatively, maybe the process must conserve isospin. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the problem says that the process must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2, and in the final state T=0. So for the final state, T=0. So 0 = S_final + L_final +1 mod 2 → S_final + L_final = 1 mod 2.

So S_final and L_final must sum to 1 modulo 2. So they must be of opposite parity. For example, if S_final is 0, then L_final must be 1; if S_final is 1, L_final must be 0; and so on.

Now, during the emission, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, so J=0. The emitted particle X has some angular momentum state, say l (lowercase), which denotes its orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum after emission must equal the initial J, which is 0.

Wait, so the initial state's total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final and X has angular momentum j (its orbital part). So the total J_final_total = J_final (of NN) + j (of X) must equal J_initial =0.

Wait, angular momentum conservation: J_initial = J_final (NN) + J_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_final (NN) + J_X =0. But J is a vector, so this implies that J_final (NN) = - J_X. But since J is a vector, the magnitude would still have to match. Hmm, but the problem gives options for the partial wave of X, which is denoted by the lowercase letter. So for each option, X has a specific l, which is its orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but J for X would be j, but in the problem statement, X's parity is given as -1. Parity is (-1)^L, so L is the orbital angular momentum. So X's parity is (-1)^X_L = -1, so X_L must be odd. So X_L is an odd integer, like 1, 3, etc.

So the parity of X is given as -1. So X has orbital angular momentum l, and l must be odd.

Now, for each option, the X is emitted in a certain partial wave. The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So X is p (a particle, likely a pion). The emitted X has L=1 (since it's D state). So parity of X is (-1)^1 = -1, which matches.

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p. X is p, L=0 (S state). Parity is (-1)^0=1. But X requires parity -1. So this might be a problem. Wait, but wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So if X is emitted in an L=0 state, its parity is (-1)^0 * intrinsic parity. Wait, no, the parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity.

Wait, the intrinsic parity is given as -1 for X. So the parity of X in a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l * (-1). So the parity is (-1)^(l+1). So to have overall parity -1, (-1)^(l+1) = -1 → (-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^1 → implies that l+1 must be odd. So l must be even. Because (l+1) is 1 mod 2 → l must be 0 mod 2.

Wait, let me double-check. The parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of X). So the total parity is (-1)^L * (-1) = (-1)^(L+1). We are told that X has parity -1. So (-1)^(L+1) = -1 → which implies that L+1 must be odd. So L must be even.

Therefore, the orbital angular momentum of X, Lx, must be even: Lx =0,2,4,... So the allowed Lx are even.

Wait, but the initial state has parity. Let me compute the parity of the initial state. The initial NN state is 1S0. The parity is (-1)^L. For 1S0, L=0 → parity is 1.

When the NN emits X, the parity of the entire system (NN and X) must be conserved. So the parity after emission is (parity of final NN state) * (parity of X) = initial parity, which is 1.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. The parity of X is (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) (since X's intrinsic parity is -1). So the product is (-1)^{L_final} * [ (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) ) ] = (-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1}.

This product must be equal to the initial parity, which is 1. So:

(-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1} = 1 → L_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_final + Lx must be odd.

So L_final and Lx must be of opposite parity. One even, one odd.

But earlier, we deduced that X's Lx must be even because the parity of X is -1. Wait, wait, let me re-examine that.

Wait, X's intrinsic parity is -1. So the parity of X in a state with orbital angular momentum Lx is (-1)^Lx * (-1). So:

Parity of X = (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) = (-1)^{Lx +1}.

We are told that X has parity -1. So (-1)^{Lx +1} = -1 → which implies that Lx +1 is odd → Lx is even. So Lx must be even: 0,2,4,...

So Lx is even. So, from the earlier equation, L_final + Lx must be odd. Since Lx is even, L_final must be odd.

Therefore, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state, L_final, must be odd.

But the final NN state has T=0. Earlier, we have that T= S_final + L_final +1 mod 2 =0. So S_final + L_final must be 1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd (from parity conservation), L_final mod 2 is 1. So S_final + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S_final must be 1 mod 2 → S_final is odd.

So S_final is 1,3,5... but since the NN system's spin can't be greater than 1 (nucleons are spin-1/2, so two nucleons can have S=0 or 1). So S_final can only be 0 or 1. But from above, S_final must be odd, which for nucleons means S_final=1.

So the final NN state has S=1 and L is odd (so L=1,3,...).

Now, looking at the options, each option has the NN state in a certain orbital angular momentum and spin state. For example, option D: 3P0. The term is 3P0. Let me parse that.

The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3P0 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is P, which is 1. So L=1. So final state has S=1, L=1.

So S =1, L=1 → S + L = 2 → which mod 2 is 0. But earlier, from T= (S + L +1) mod 2, for the final state T=0. Let's check:

S=1, L=1 → S + L =2 → 2 +1=3 → 3 mod 2=1. But T is given as 0. So this would give T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. Hmm, so this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate:

The equation is T = (S + L + 1) mod 2.

So for the final state, T=0.

So 0 = (S + L +1 ) mod 2.

Which implies that S + L must be 1 mod 2.

In the case of option D, NN is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. So S + L = 2 → 0 mod 2. Thus, S + L = 0 → 0 +1 =1 mod 2. So T=(0 +1) mod 2 =1. Which is not equal to 0. So this state would have T=1, which is not allowed because the problem says T=0.

Wait, but this is the final state. So if the final state has T=0, then this final state in option D is not allowed. So that would make option D invalid.

But let's check the other options.

Option A: 7D1. The term is 7D1. So (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L=D=3. So S=3 and L=3. Wait, but wait, two nucleons (spin-1/2) can't have S=3. Because the maximum total spin for two spin-1/2 particles is 1. So S can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, 7D1 is impossible because S=3 is not allowed. So this option is invalid because it's impossible for two nucleons to have S=3. So this option is not permitted.

Wait, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So if any of the options result in an impossible state, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me check all options.

Option A: 7D1. As above, S=3 is impossible for two nucleons. So this is not permitted. So this option is invalid.

Option B: 3S1. The term is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S (so L=0). So L=0. So S=1, L=0. Then S + L =1. So 1 +1=2 mod 2 → 0. So T= (1 + 0 +1) mod 2= (2) mod 2=0. Which matches the given T=0. So this is allowed.

Option C: 3D3. The term is 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=D=2. So S=1, L=2. Then S + L=3 → 3 mod 2=1. So T= (1 +2 +1)=4 → 0 mod 2. So T=0. Which is allowed.

Option D: 3P0. As before, S=1, L=1. S + L=2 → 0 mod 2. So T= (1 +1 +1)=3 → 1 mod 2. Which would make T=1, but the problem requires T=0. So this state is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier, I thought option D's L=1, which is odd, which is required because Lx is even, so L_final must be odd.

But for option D, the NN state has L=1 (which is odd), which is correct. But the calculation of T shows that T=1, which conflicts with the problem's T=0.

So option D is not permitted.

Wait, but in option A, the 7D1 state is impossible because S=3 isn't allowed for two nucleons. So why is that option even considered? The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted, so perhaps option A and D are invalid.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So looking at each option, the emitted X's orbital angular momentum l is determined by the term in the option.

Wait, let me correct myself. The options specify the final NN state and the type of X emitted. The partial wave of X is given by the lowercase letter. For example, option A: 7D1 + p. So X is a pion (p), and the partial wave is l=1 (D state). So l=1 is odd.

But earlier, we concluded that X must have Lx even because X's parity is -1.

Wait, because X's parity is (-1)^Lx * (-1) = -1 → (-1)^{Lx+1} =-1 → so Lx must be even.

So for X's partial wave l to be allowed, l must be even.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X is p, l=1 → D state. 1 is odd → not allowed. So this would violate the condition for X's parity.

Option B: X is p, l=0 → S state. 0 is even → allowed.

Option C: X is f, l=3 → F state. 3 is odd → not allowed.

Option D: X is s, l=0 → S state. 0 is even → allowed.

Wait, so according to this, options A and C have X emitted in an l which is odd. But X must have even l.

So these options would not be permitted because their X's orbital angular momentum l is odd, making X's parity not -1.

But wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X in a given state is (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity. So for X's parity to be -1, (-1)^l * (-1) must be -1 → (-1)^{l+1} = -1 → which implies that l+1 is odd → l is even.

So X must have l even.

So any option where X's l is odd is invalid.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: X is p emitted in D (l=1). So l=1 is odd → invalid.

Option B: X is p in S (l=0) → valid.

Option C: X is f in F (l=3) → invalid.

Option D: X is s in S (l=0) → valid.

So options A and C are invalid because their X's l is odd, which would make X's parity not -1.

Wait, but the question says 'the term symbol ... is in general defined (2S+1)L(J) where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.'

So the X particle's orbital angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. So in each option, the X's orbital angular momentum l must be even.

Hmm, so the problem is about which partial wave (for X) is not allowed.

So the question is, which of the options has X emitted in an l which is invalid (i.e., not even).

So in options A, X is D (l=1) → invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3) → invalid.

Options B and D are valid.

But wait, the problem statement says 'use conservation of both angular momentum and parity.' So not only must X's l be even, but the angular momentum and parity must also be conserved.

Wait, let me think again. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial=0. After emission, the final NN state has J_final = ? And X has j. So J_initial = J_final + j. But since J_initial is 0, J_final must equal -j. But J is a vector, so the magnitudes must match. So |J_final| = |j|.

Hmm, but the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So let's think about each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. The X is p with l=1. So j for X would be... Well, j can have values from l - s to l + s, but s for pion is 0. So j =1. So J_final must be 1, but the initial J is 0. How can J_final be 1? Because J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal -j. But j is 1, so J_final would be 1, but the initial J is 0. This doesn't make sense. So this process would not conserve angular momentum. So this option is impossible.

But wait, perhaps the process is (NN) + X. So initial J=0, so (NN)_final J and X's j must satisfy J_final + j =0. So j = - J_final. Since angular momentum is conserved, the magnitudes must satisfy |J_final| = |j|.

But the initial J is 0, so J_final and j must be such that their vector sum is zero. So J_final = -j. So their magnitudes are equal: |J_final|=|j|.

So for each option, we can check whether the emitted X's j is compatible.

For option A: X has l=1, s=0 → j =1. So NN's J_final must be 1. And the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse that.

The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3 (impossible for two nucleons), so this is invalid. So option A is invalid for two reasons: impossible S=3, and the angular momentum conservation would require J_final=1, but the final NN state's J is 1 (since D1 is L=2 and S=3, but wait, no. Wait, for term symbol, J is given as 1. So if the final NN state has J=1, and X has j=1, then 1 +1=2, but initial J is 0. So that can't work. So even if the state were possible, the angular momentum wouldn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: The initial total J is 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final, and X has j. So J_initial = J_final + j → 0 = J_final + j → J_final = -j.

So the magnitudes must satisfy |J_final| = |j|.

So for each option, the final NN's J must equal j in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But J is a vector, so the magnitudes must match, but the direction would have to cancel out. So for example, if X has j=1, then NN must have J_final=1, but in the opposite direction. But the magnitude is 1.

But the problem is that the option states the term symbol of the final NN state. So the term symbol gives J. So for example, option A: the final state is 7D1, which has J=1. So X must have j=1. So J_final=1, j=1. So 1 +1 =2→ but initial J is 0, so that's impossible. So this option is invalid.

Similarly, let's check all options.

Option A: X l=1 → j=1. Final NN J=1. So J_final + j = 1 +1=2≠0. So invalid.

Option B: X is p → l=0 → j=0. Final NN is 3S1, J=1. So j=0, J_final=1 → 1 +0=1≠0. So J not conserved. So this is invalid.

Wait, but option B says 3S1, which is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 is S=1, L=0, J=1. X is p (l=0, j=0). So J_initial=0. J_final=1, j=0. So 1 +0=1≠0. So this doesn't conserve J. So option B is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B is valid because X's l is even. Wait, no, X's l is 0 (even), so parity is correct. But angular momentum isn't conserved here. So that makes option B invalid, but earlier I thought it was allowed because T=0.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to approach this systematically.

Each option gives the final state of NN and the type of X emitted. For each, we need to check:

1. X's l: must be even (because X's parity is -1).

2. Angular momentum conservation: J_initial (0) = J_final (NN) + j (X).

3. Parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) = 1 (since initial parity is 1).

Wait, no, let's recompute parity. The parity after emission is (parity of final NN) * (parity of X) = initial parity (1).

Parity of final NN is (-1)^{L_final}.

Parity of X is (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) (intrinsic parity of X is -1).

So:

(-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) =1.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L_final + Lx +1} =1 → L_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_final + Lx must be odd.

So for each option, L_final and Lx must be of opposite parity.

Additionally, X's Lx must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: X is D (l=1, which is odd) → invalid because Lx must be even.

Option B: X is S (l=0, even). So Lx=0, which is okay.

The final NN state is 3S1 → L_final=0 (S state). So L_final=0 (even), Lx=0 (even). So L_final + Lx =0 +0=0 → even. But from parity conservation, L_final + Lx must be odd. So this doesn't match. So parity is not conserved. So option B is invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3, which is odd) → invalid.

Option D: X is S (l=0, even). Final NN state is 3P0 → L_final=1 (P state). L_final=1 (odd), Lx=0 (even). Sum is 1, which is odd → parity conserved.

So for option D:

- Lx=0 (even) → X's parity is correct.

- L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum is 1 (odd) → parity condition satisfied.

- Angular momentum: X has l=0, so j=0 (since it's a scalar particle, assuming X is a pion with spin 0). So j=0.

The final NN state has J=0 (since term is 3P0 → J is 0). So J_final=0, j=0. So 0 +0=0 → J conserved.

So option D satisfies both angular momentum and parity conservation.

So option D is allowed.

Now, looking at the options, the invalid ones are A, B, and C.

Wait, no.

Wait, option B: X's l=0 (even), so parity is correct. But L_final + Lx =0 +0=0 → even, which doesn't satisfy the parity condition (needs to be odd). So parity is not conserved. So option B is invalid.

Option A: X's l=1 → invalid.

Option C: X's l=3 → invalid.

So only option D is valid.

The question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options that are invalid are A,B,C. But let me re-examine each.

Wait, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the particle X's partial wave is given in the options as the lowercase letter. So in option A, X is in D (l=1). Since l must be even, this is not permitted.

Similarly, option C: X in F (l=3), which is odd→ not permitted.

But the question asks which option is not permitted. So the answer could be any of A, B, C, or D? No, because D is permitted.

Wait, the question is about the partial wave of X. So each option's X has a certain l. The ones with l even are allowed; the ones with l odd are not.

So options A (D, l=1), C (F, l=3) are invalid because l is odd. Option B (S, l=0) is allowed if other conditions are met.

But wait, in option B, even though X's l is allowed, the angular momentum isn't conserved.

Because X has j=0 (since l=0 and s=0 for pion?), and the final NN state has J=1. So J_final + j =1 +0=1≠0. So angular momentum not conserved. So option B's process is impossible even though X's l is even.

So for the problem, which partial wave is not permitted? The partial wave refers to X's l. So the options where X's l is odd (A and C) are invalid. But option B's X's l is even, but angular momentum isn't conserved. But the question is about the partial wave not permitted because of parity. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but the problem says to consider both conservation of angular momentum and parity.

So the invalid options are A, B, C. Only D is valid.

But wait, the problem statement says that the final NN state has T=0. For each option, we must also verify that T=0.

So for the final state of NN, T must be 0.

Earlier, we found that T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

In option D: final state is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. So T =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1 → but T must be 0. So this would make T=1, which is invalid. So option D's final state has T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0.

Hmm, this complicates things. So even though option D's X has correct l and parity and angular momentum is conserved, the final state's T is 1, but the problem requires T=0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, so let's reevaluate:

If the final state's T must be 0, then S + L must be 1 mod 2.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → 0 mod2. So T= (1+1+1) mod2= 3 mod2=1≠0→ not allowed.

So option D is invalid.

Which leaves us with option B.

In option B: the final state is 3S1. S=1, L=0. So S + L=1 → T=(1+0 +1) mod2=0. So T=0, which is correct.

But angular momentum: X has l=0, j=0. Final NN's J=1. So J_final=1, j=0. So 1 +0=1≠0. So angular momentum not conserved.

So option B is invalid.

Wait, but the initial J is 0. So the sum of final J and X's j must be zero. So J_final + j =0.

In option B, J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0.

So option B is invalid.

So now, the only possible option that could be valid is none? Because all options seem invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me try to re-express the problem.

Given the initial state is 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0), emit X with parity -1.

The final NN state has T=0. From T= S + L +1 mod2 → 0= S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1.

X must have even Lx to have parity -1.

Parity conservation: L_final + Lx must be odd.

Angular momentum conservation: J_final (NN) + j (X) =0. So j must be equal and opposite to J_final.

So for each option:

Option A: X is D (l=1, j=1). Final NN:7D1 → impossible S=3. So invalid.

Option B: X is S (l=0, j=0). Final NN:3S1 (S=1, L=0, J=1). T=1+0+1 mod2=0. So T=0.

J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0. So invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3, j=3). But l=3 is odd→ invalid.

Option D: X is S (l=0, j=0). Final NN:3P0 (S=1, L=1, J=0). T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1→ invalid.

Wait, but J_final in option D is 0. So j must be 0. X's j=0.

So J_final =0, j=0 → sum=0, which is correct.

But T for option D is 1, which is not allowed. So option D is invalid.

So none of the options except perhaps none are valid? But the question says which is not permitted, implying one is the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the J calculation for the final state.

Let's see:

In option D: 3P0. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3P0 → (2*1+1)=3, L=P=1, J=0.

So J_final=0.

X's j=0.

So J_final +j=0 → correct.

Parity:

L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum=1, which is odd. So (-1)^{1+0 +1} = (-1)^2=1 → parity conserved.

T for option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → mod 2=0. So T= (0 +1) mod2=1→ can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod2. So in the final state, T=0. So for each option, we must have S + L =1 mod2.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → mod2=0 → T=0+1=1 mod2→ T=1. Doesn't fit.

Thus, option D is invalid.

So the only options which have X's l even and S + L=1 are option B and any other?

Wait, let's see:

Looking for options where:

1. X's l is even.

2. Final NN's S + L =1 mod2.

3. L_final + Lx is odd.

4. J_final + j =0.

Let me see which options meet all criteria.

Option B:

X l=0 (even).

Final NN:3S1 → S=1, L=0 → S+L=1 → T=0 (correct).

L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0 (even). But parity conservation requires L_final + Lx must be odd. So parity not conserved. So invalid.

Option D:

X l=0.

Final NN:3P0 → S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → T=1 (wrong).

So even though parity is conserved (L_final=1 + Lx=0=1, which is odd), T isn't correct.

So no options meet all the criteria.

But the problem must have an answer. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the term symbol for X is different. Maybe the problem states that the term symbol is for the NN system, and X is a separate particle. So X's term symbol is given by the lowercase letter, which is its orbital angular momentum.

So for each option, the X has l as per the lowercase letter.

So for option D: X is s (l=0).

Thus, in option D, X's parity is (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1, which is correct.

Parity of NN after emission is (-1)^{L_final}.

Parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1).

So overall parity: (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.

This must equal initial parity (1).

So L_final + l +1 must be even → L_final + l must be odd.

In option D: L_final=1 (P state), l=0 → sum=1 (odd) → parity conserved.

J_final=0, j=0 → angular momentum conserved.

T= S + L +1 mod2 → S=1, L=1 → 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1 → T=1, which doesn't match the required T=0.

So option D is invalid.

Option B: l=0.

L_final=0 → L_final + l =0 → even. So parity not conserved. So invalid.

Only option left is A and C, but their X's l are odd, so X's parity would be (-1)^{l}*(-1)= (-1)^{even}*(-1)= 1*(-1)=-1 → which is correct. So for l=1: parity is (-1)^{1}*(-1) = (-1)*(-1)=1? Wait, wait:

Wait, X's parity is (-1)^Lx * intrinsic_parity. So intrinsic parity is -1.

For option A: Lx=1 → parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1)=1. But X must have parity -1. So this is incorrect. So option A's X's parity is +1, which is not allowed. So option A is invalid.

Similarly, option C: X's l=3 → parity is (-1)^3*(-1)= (-1)*(-1)=1 → invalid.

So the only option where X's parity is correct is when l is even.

But none of the options with l even satisfy T=0 and angular momentum conservation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the T condition.

The problem statement says: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2).

Wait, is that correct? Or is it T = S + L +1 mod2?

Wait, the problem says: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

So T = S + L +1 mod2.

In option B, T would be 1+0+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

But angular momentum is not conserved.

So, option B's final state has T=0, but angular momentum isn't conserved.

So the only option that meets all conditions is none, but since the problem must have an answer, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the orbital angular momentum in the reaction.

The initial state has L=0. When the NN emit X, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN and X must satisfy L_final + Lx = L_initial → 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero. So after emission, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN and X must sum to zero.

So L_final (NN) + Lx (X) = 0 (vectorially).

Which in magnitude would mean that L_final = Lx, but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite.

So for example, if X has Lx=0, then L_final must be 0.

If X has Lx=1, L_final must be 1.

But since the initial state's L is zero, this is the only way to conserve angular momentum.

So for each option:

Option A: X l=1 → Lx=1. So L_final=1. So the final NN's L must be 1.

The term for the final NN is 7D1 → L=2 (D=2) → no, because L_final must be 1. So this is invalid.

Option B: X l=0 → Lx=0. So L_final=0. The term is 3S1 → L=0 → correct.

So this satisfies L conservation.

But earlier, in option B, J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0. So J not conserved.

So even though L is conserved, J is not.

So option B is invalid.

Option C: X l=3 → Lx=3. So L_final=3. The final state is 3D3 → L=2 → invalid.

Option D: X l=0 → L_final=0. The final state is 3P0 → L=1→ invalid.

So only option B has L_final=0, which matches Lx=0. But J not conserved.

Hmm, but I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D.

The correct answer is the option where either X's l is odd (so parity is wrong), or the conservation laws are not met.

So the invalid options are:

A: X l=1 → parity correct? No. Because X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1)=1. But X needs parity -1. So this is incorrect.

B: X l=0 → parity correct. But J not conserved.

C: X l=3 → parity correct? No. Because (-1)^3*(-1)=1. So parity is +1, which is incorrect.

D: X l=0 → parity correct. J conserved. T=1≠0.

So options A and C have X's parity incorrect. So they are invalid. Options B and D have X's parity correct but other issues.

The question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the partial wave refers to X's l.

Thus, any option where X's l is odd would have parity +1 (since (-1)^{l}*(-1) = (-1)^{l+1}, and if l is odd, l+1 is even → parity +1), which is incorrect because X's parity must be -1.

So options A and C have X's l odd → their X's parity would be +1, which is invalid. So these options are invalid.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is either A or C. But the options give these as options A and C.

The question says 'which of the following partial waves is not permitted'.

So the answer is one of the options where X's l is odd.

Between options A and C, both are invalid because their X's l is odd.

But the problem gives four options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. When X is emitted, the NN and X's angular momenta must sum to zero.

So for each option, the emitted X's j must be equal and opposite to the NN's J.

So for option B: X is p (l=0, j=0). NN's J=1. So j=0 can't cancel J=1. So invalid.

Option D: X j=0. NN's J=0. So 0+0=0 → valid.

But in option D, T=1, which is not allowed. So it's invalid.

So the only options with X's l even are B and D. But both are invalid for other reasons.

So looking back, the only options where X's l is even are B and D. But both have issues.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer must be one of the options with X's l odd (A and C), which have parity +1, which is invalid.

But the problem states that X's parity is -1. So options with X's l odd have parity +1 → invalid.

So the invalid options are A and C.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So among the options, the ones with X's l even are permitted, and the ones with l odd are not.

Thus, the answer is either A or C. But looking at the options:

Option A: X is p in D (l=1) → parity +1 → invalid.

Option C: X is f in F (l=3) → parity +1 → invalid.

The question is which is not permitted. So both A and C are invalid, but the options don't allow for multiple answers.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The question is about the NN emitting X, and the options describe the transition.

In option B: the final state is 3S1, which has J=1. But the initial J is 0. So J not conserved, which is a problem.

But the question says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

So the only option where both parity and angular momentum are conserved, and T=0 is option D.

But in option D, T=1, which is not allowed. So no option meets all conditions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the T calculation. Let me re-express T:

Problem states: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod2.

So T = (S + L +1) mod2.

In option B: S=1, L=0 → T=1+0+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

In option B, X's l=0, which is even → parity correct.

L_final=0, Lx=0 → L_final + Lx=0 → even. But parity must be conserved, which requires L_final + Lx +1 even → 0 +0 +1=1 → odd. So parity not conserved.

So option B is invalid.

Only option D: T=1→ invalid.

Thus, the only options that meet X's l even and parity conserved are none. But the problem must have an answer.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the T condition. Maybe the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2, but perhaps it's (S + L) +1 mod2.

Yes, that's how the problem states it: T = S + L +1 mod2.

So in option D: S=1, L=1 → T=1+1 +1=3 mod2=1→ no.

In option B: S=1, L=0 → T=1+0 +1=2 mod2=0→ yes.

So option B meets T condition.

But L_final + Lx=0 +0=0 → even. So parity condition not met.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus solely on the parity condition and Pauli's condition.

The correct answer must be the option where X's l is odd (invalid) or other conditions not met.

Given the options, the answer is likely option A, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, looking for the answer.

The possible options with X's l even are B and D. But their other conditions are not met.

The options where X's l is odd (A and C) have X's parity incorrect.

So the partial wave not permitted is where X's l is odd. So options A and C are invalid.

But the problem gives four options, and only one is correct.

Looking back at the options:

The correct answer is the one where X's l is odd, making it invalid. So the answer is either A or C.

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is D, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of parity.

Let me re-calculate X's parity.

X's parity is (-1)^Lx * intrinsic_parity.

Intrinsic_parity of X is -1.

So X's parity is (-1)^l * (-1).

We are told that X has parity -1.

So:

(-1)^l * (-1) = -1 → (-1)^l = 1 → l even.

So X's l must be even.

Thus, options with l odd (A and C) have X's parity =1, which is invalid.

So the answer is the option where X's l is odd, which are A and C.

But the problem requires selecting one option.

Looking at the options, which option has X's l odd and thus is not permitted?

A) l=1 → D state.

C) l=3 → F state.

So both have X's l odd → X's parity is +1, which is invalid.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is either A or C.

But looking at the options, option C is 3D3 + f. The f denotes l=3 (F state), which is odd.

So option C's X has l=3, which is odd. Thus, parity incorrect.

Thus, option C is not permitted.

But why is option A also not permitted?

The problem might have a typo, but given the options, the correct answer is likely option D.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Another approach: The correct answer should be option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each option's feasibility.

Option D: 3P0 + s → X is s (l=0), even. So X's parity is correct.

The final NN state is 3P0: S=1, L=1, J=0.

T =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1→ T=1, which is invalid.

So option D is invalid.

Thus, no option meets all conditions, but the intended answer is likely option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parity.

Wait, the parity of the entire system after emission must be 1 (same as initial). The parity is product of NN and X.

So:

Parity_after = [ (-1)^L_final ] * [ (-1)^Lx * (-1) ) ] = (-1)^{L_final + Lx} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_final + Lx +1}.

So this must equal initial parity of 1.

Thus:

(-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1} = 1 → exponent must be even.

So L_final + Lx +1 is even → L_final + Lx is odd.

So in option D: L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum=1→ odd. So parity conserved.

J_final=0, j=0 → J conserved.

T=1+1 +1=3 mod2=1→ invalid.

So option D is invalid.

Thus, the only options that have X's l even and L_final + Lx odd are B and D.

But B has L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0→ even. So parity not conserved.

So the only option that has X's l even and parity conserved is D, but D's T is incorrect.

Thus, no options are valid, but the question must have an answer.

Alternative thought: Perhaps the problem uses a different convention for T. Alternatively, maybe the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that T is the isospin of the NN system, which for two nucleons can be 0 or 1.

The initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0 → T =0 +0 +1=1 mod2=1.

The final state must have T=0.

So for the final state, T= S + L +1=0 mod2 → S + L=1 mod2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity.

Additionally, X's l must be even.

So for each option, let me compute S, L and check.

Option A: final state 7D1 → S=3 (invalid), so impossible.

Option B: final state 3S1 → S=1, L=0 → S+L=1→ T=0 mod2. Correct.

X's l=0→ even. So parity is (-1)^0 * (-1) =-1 → correct.

L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0→ even. So parity_after = (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * (-1) = (-1)^0 * (-1) → wait, no:

Wait, parity_after = (-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^Lx * (-1) ) ].

So for option B: (-1)^0 * [ (-1)^0 * (-1) ) ] = 1 * [1*(-1)] = -1. But initial parity is 1. So parity_after is -1, which doesn't match.

Thus, option B is invalid.

Option C: X's l=3 → invalid.

Option D: final state 3P0 → S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 mod2=0 → T= (0 +1) mod2 → T=1→ invalid.

Thus, only option B has T correct but parity incorrect. Option D has T incorrect but parity correct.

Thus, the only valid options are none.

But the question must have an answer. I think I'm overcomplicating.

The intended answer is likely option D, but based on the conditions, it's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D because it's the only one where X's l is even and the other conditions are met except T, but the problem requires T=0.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the question asks which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial NN state is 1S0, with \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The isospin of the initial state is \( T_{\text{initial}} = (S + L + 1) \, (\text{mod} \, 2) = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \). Using the condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), this implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Thus, \( S(NN) \) and \( L(NN) \) must be of opposite parity.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state is 1. After emission, the parity of the system is the product of the parities of the final NN state and X. The parity of X is given as -1, and the parity of the final NN state is \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \). Thus:
   \[
   (-1)^{L(NN)} \cdot (-1)^{L(X)} \cdot (-1) = 1 \implies L(NN) + L(X) + 1 \, \text{is even} \implies L(NN) + L(X) \, \text{is odd}.
   \]
   Since \( L(X) \) must be even (to ensure X's parity is -1), \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum before and after emission must be conserved. The initial state has \( J = 0 \), so the total angular momentum after emission, \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X \), must also sum to zero. This implies \( J_{\text{final}} = -j_X \), and their magnitudes must match.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \) implies \( S = 3 \), which is impossible for two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles).  
  - Additionally, \( L(X) = 1 \) (D state), which is odd. Since \( L(X) \) must be even, this option is invalid.

- **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 0 \), \( J = 1 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
  - \( L(X) = 0 \) (S state), which is even, so X's parity is correct.  
  - However, angular momentum is not conserved: \( J_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( j_X = 0 \), so \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X = 1 \neq 0 \).  
  - This option is invalid.

- **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 2 \), \( J = 3 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
  - \( L(X) = 3 \) (F state), which is odd. Since \( L(X) \) must be even, this option is invalid.

- **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 1 \), \( J = 0 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 1 \), which does not satisfy \( T = 0 \).  
  - \( L(X) = 0 \) (S state), which is even, so X's parity is correct.  
  - Angular momentum is conserved: \( J_{\text{final}} = 0 \), \( j_X = 0 \), so \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X = 0 \).  
  - This option is invalid due to the isospin condition.

### Conclusion:
The only options where \( L(X) \) is even (valid parity for X) are B and D. However, both fail due to angular momentum or isospin conservation. The options where \( L(X) \) is odd (invalid parity for X) are A and C. Among these, **Option A** is the most clearly invalid because \( L(X) = 1 \) (D state) results in X's parity being +1, which contradicts the given intrinsic parity of -1.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Hmm, let me think. The question is about Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Alright, let's break it down.

The system is two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So, the initial state is 1S0. The problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final state has T(NN)=0. So, I think T is the isospin, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right, isospin is a concept in particle physics where protons and neutrons are treated as two states of the same particle (the nucleon). So for two nucleons, their isospin can be either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet).

Wait, the question says the final T(NN) is 0. So the two nucleons after emission have an isospin of 0. So that must mean they are in a singlet state. Because isospin 0 implies symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, no, isospin is a separate quantum number from spin. Hmm, but Pauli's exclusion applies based on the total quantum state, which includes spin, isospin, etc.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 implies 2S+1=1 → S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, which is 0 (S-state). So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. Because J is given as 0.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN state plus X. The process should conserve angular momentum and parity.

The problem statement also says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum (S + L) plus 1 must equal T mod 2.

Wait, no, the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the NN system, S is their spin, L is their orbital angular momentum.

The initial state is 1S0, so for the initial NN state, S=0, L=0. So T_initial would be 0 + 0 +1 mod 2 =1. But wait, the initial NN state's isospin is not given. Hmm, wait, the problem says that the initial state is 1S0, which is for the bound system. But when they emit X, the final NN state has T=0. So the initial NN state may have T=1 or T=0? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says that the initial state is 1S0, but after emitting X, the NN is in a state with T=0. So the initial state's T must be determined based on the process. Or perhaps it's the initial state's T that's being considered here? No, because the problem says that the final T is 0.

Let me think. The initial state is 1S0, which is the NN bound state. So their spin S is 0, orbital L is 0, so J is 0. The isospin T for the initial state would be (S + L +1) mod 2. So S=0, L=0. So T_initial = (0 + 0 +1) mod 2 =1. So T_initial=1.

But after emitting X, the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin changes from 1 to 0. Hmm, but how does that happen? When a particle is emitted, how does isospin change? Wait, isospin is another conserved quantity, but only approximately. Alternatively, maybe the process must conserve isospin. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the problem says that the process must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2, and in the final state T=0. So for the final state, T=0. So 0 = S_final + L_final +1 mod 2 → S_final + L_final = 1 mod 2.

So S_final and L_final must sum to 1 modulo 2. So they must be of opposite parity. For example, if S_final is 0, then L_final must be 1; if S_final is 1, L_final must be 0; and so on.

Now, during the emission, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, so J=0. The emitted particle X has some angular momentum state, say l (lowercase), which denotes its orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum after emission must equal the initial J, which is 0.

Wait, so the initial state's total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final and X has angular momentum j (its orbital part). So the total J_final_total = J_final (of NN) + j (of X) must equal J_initial =0.

Wait, angular momentum conservation: J_initial = J_final (NN) + J_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_final (NN) + J_X =0. But J is a vector, so this implies that J_final (NN) = - J_X. But since J is a vector, the magnitude would still have to match. Hmm, but the problem gives options for the partial wave of X, which is denoted by the lowercase letter. So for each option, X has a specific l, which is its orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but J for X would be j, but in the problem statement, X's parity is given as -1. Parity is (-1)^L, so L is the orbital angular momentum. So X's parity is (-1)^X_L = -1, so X_L must be odd. So X_L is an odd integer, like 1, 3, etc.

So the parity of X is given as -1. So X has orbital angular momentum l, and l must be odd.

Now, for each option, the X is emitted in a certain partial wave. The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So X is p (a particle, likely a pion). The emitted X has L=1 (since it's D state). So parity of X is (-1)^1 = -1, which matches.

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p. X is p, L=0 (S state). Parity is (-1)^0=1. But X requires parity -1. So this might be a problem. Wait, but wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So if X is emitted in an L=0 state, its parity is (-1)^0 * intrinsic parity. Wait, no, the parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity.

Wait, the intrinsic parity is given as -1 for X. So the parity of X in a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l * (-1). So the parity is (-1)^(l+1). So to have overall parity -1, (-1)^(l+1) = -1 → (-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^1 → implies that l+1 must be odd. So l must be even. Because (l+1) is 1 mod 2 → l must be 0 mod 2.

Wait, let me double-check. The parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of X). So the total parity is (-1)^L * (-1) = (-1)^(L+1). We are told that X has parity -1. So (-1)^(L+1) = -1 → which implies that L+1 must be odd. So L must be even.

Therefore, the orbital angular momentum of X, Lx, must be even: Lx =0,2,4,... So the allowed Lx are even.

Wait, but the initial state has parity. Let me compute the parity of the initial state. The initial NN state is 1S0. The parity is (-1)^L. For 1S0, L=0 → parity is 1.

When the NN emits X, the parity of the entire system (NN and X) must be conserved. So the parity after emission is (parity of final NN state) * (parity of X) = initial parity, which is 1.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. The parity of X is (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) (since X's intrinsic parity is -1). So the product is (-1)^{L_final} * [ (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) ) ] = (-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1}.

This product must be equal to the initial parity, which is 1. So:

(-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1} = 1 → L_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_final + Lx must be odd.

So L_final and Lx must be of opposite parity. One even, one odd.

But earlier, we deduced that X's Lx must be even because the parity of X is -1. Wait, wait, let me re-examine that.

Wait, X's intrinsic parity is -1. So the parity of X in a state with orbital angular momentum Lx is (-1)^Lx * (-1). So:

Parity of X = (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) = (-1)^{Lx +1}.

We are told that X has parity -1. So (-1)^{Lx +1} = -1 → which implies that Lx +1 is odd → Lx is even. So Lx must be even: 0,2,4,...

So Lx is even. So, from the earlier equation, L_final + Lx must be odd. Since Lx is even, L_final must be odd.

Therefore, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state, L_final, must be odd.

But the final NN state has T=0. Earlier, we have that T= S_final + L_final +1 mod 2 =0. So S_final + L_final must be 1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd (from parity conservation), L_final mod 2 is 1. So S_final + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S_final must be 1 mod 2 → S_final is odd.

So S_final is 1,3,5... but since the NN system's spin can't be greater than 1 (nucleons are spin-1/2, so two nucleons can have S=0 or 1). So S_final can only be 0 or 1. But from above, S_final must be odd, which for nucleons means S_final=1.

So the final NN state has S=1 and L is odd (so L=1,3,...).

Now, looking at the options, each option has the NN state in a certain orbital angular momentum and spin state. For example, option D: 3P0. The term is 3P0. Let me parse that.

The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3P0 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is P, which is 1. So L=1. So final state has S=1, L=1.

So S =1, L=1 → S + L = 2 → which mod 2 is 0. But earlier, from T= (S + L +1) mod 2, for the final state T=0. Let's check:

S=1, L=1 → S + L =2 → 2 +1=3 → 3 mod 2=1. But T is given as 0. So this would give T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. Hmm, so this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate:

The equation is T = (S + L + 1) mod 2.

So for the final state, T=0.

So 0 = (S + L +1 ) mod 2.

Which implies that S + L must be 1 mod 2.

In the case of option D, NN is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. So S + L = 2 → 0 mod 2. Thus, S + L = 0 → 0 +1 =1 mod 2. So T=(0 +1) mod 2 =1. Which is not equal to 0. So this state would have T=1, which is not allowed because the problem says T=0.

Wait, but this is the final state. So if the final state has T=0, then this final state in option D is not allowed. So that would make option D invalid.

But let's check the other options.

Option A: 7D1. The term is 7D1. So (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L=D=3. So S=3 and L=3. Wait, but wait, two nucleons (spin-1/2) can't have S=3. Because the maximum total spin for two spin-1/2 particles is 1. So S can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, 7D1 is impossible because S=3 is not allowed. So this option is invalid because it's impossible for two nucleons to have S=3. So this option is not permitted.

Wait, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So if any of the options result in an impossible state, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me check all options.

Option A: 7D1. As above, S=3 is impossible for two nucleons. So this is not permitted. So this option is invalid.

Option B: 3S1. The term is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S (so L=0). So L=0. So S=1, L=0. Then S + L =1. So 1 +1=2 mod 2 → 0. So T= (1 + 0 +1) mod 2= (2) mod 2=0. Which matches the given T=0. So this is allowed.

Option C: 3D3. The term is 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=D=2. So S=1, L=2. Then S + L=3 → 3 mod 2=1. So T= (1 +2 +1)=4 → 0 mod 2. So T=0. Which is allowed.

Option D: 3P0. As before, S=1, L=1. S + L=2 → 0 mod 2. So T= (1 +1 +1)=3 → 1 mod 2. Which would make T=1, but the problem requires T=0. So this state is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier, I thought option D's L=1, which is odd, which is required because Lx is even, so L_final must be odd.

But for option D, the NN state has L=1 (which is odd), which is correct. But the calculation of T shows that T=1, which conflicts with the problem's T=0.

So option D is not permitted.

Wait, but in option A, the 7D1 state is impossible because S=3 isn't allowed for two nucleons. So why is that option even considered? The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted, so perhaps option A and D are invalid.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So looking at each option, the emitted X's orbital angular momentum l is determined by the term in the option.

Wait, let me correct myself. The options specify the final NN state and the type of X emitted. The partial wave of X is given by the lowercase letter. For example, option A: 7D1 + p. So X is a pion (p), and the partial wave is l=1 (D state). So l=1 is odd.

But earlier, we concluded that X must have Lx even because X's parity is -1.

Wait, because X's parity is (-1)^Lx * (-1) = -1 → (-1)^{Lx+1} =-1 → so Lx must be even.

So for X's partial wave l to be allowed, l must be even.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X is p, l=1 → D state. 1 is odd → not allowed. So this would violate the condition for X's parity.

Option B: X is p, l=0 → S state. 0 is even → allowed.

Option C: X is f, l=3 → F state. 3 is odd → not allowed.

Option D: X is s, l=0 → S state. 0 is even → allowed.

Wait, so according to this, options A and C have X emitted in an l which is odd. But X must have even l.

So these options would not be permitted because their X's orbital angular momentum l is odd, making X's parity not -1.

But wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X in a given state is (-1)^l * intrinsic_parity. So for X's parity to be -1, (-1)^l * (-1) must be -1 → (-1)^{l+1} = -1 → which implies that l+1 is odd → l is even.

So X must have l even.

So any option where X's l is odd is invalid.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: X is p emitted in D (l=1). So l=1 is odd → invalid.

Option B: X is p in S (l=0) → valid.

Option C: X is f in F (l=3) → invalid.

Option D: X is s in S (l=0) → valid.

So options A and C are invalid because their X's l is odd, which would make X's parity not -1.

Wait, but the question says 'the term symbol ... is in general defined (2S+1)L(J) where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.'

So the X particle's orbital angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. So in each option, the X's orbital angular momentum l must be even.

Hmm, so the problem is about which partial wave (for X) is not allowed.

So the question is, which of the options has X emitted in an l which is invalid (i.e., not even).

So in options A, X is D (l=1) → invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3) → invalid.

Options B and D are valid.

But wait, the problem statement says 'use conservation of both angular momentum and parity.' So not only must X's l be even, but the angular momentum and parity must also be conserved.

Wait, let me think again. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial=0. After emission, the final NN state has J_final = ? And X has j. So J_initial = J_final + j. But since J_initial is 0, J_final must equal -j. But J is a vector, so the magnitudes must match. So |J_final| = |j|.

Hmm, but the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So let's think about each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. The X is p with l=1. So j for X would be... Well, j can have values from l - s to l + s, but s for pion is 0. So j =1. So J_final must be 1, but the initial J is 0. How can J_final be 1? Because J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal -j. But j is 1, so J_final would be 1, but the initial J is 0. This doesn't make sense. So this process would not conserve angular momentum. So this option is impossible.

But wait, perhaps the process is (NN) + X. So initial J=0, so (NN)_final J and X's j must satisfy J_final + j =0. So j = - J_final. Since angular momentum is conserved, the magnitudes must satisfy |J_final| = |j|.

But the initial J is 0, so J_final and j must be such that their vector sum is zero. So J_final = -j. So their magnitudes are equal: |J_final|=|j|.

So for each option, we can check whether the emitted X's j is compatible.

For option A: X has l=1, s=0 → j =1. So NN's J_final must be 1. And the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse that.

The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3 (impossible for two nucleons), so this is invalid. So option A is invalid for two reasons: impossible S=3, and the angular momentum conservation would require J_final=1, but the final NN state's J is 1 (since D1 is L=2 and S=3, but wait, no. Wait, for term symbol, J is given as 1. So if the final NN state has J=1, and X has j=1, then 1 +1=2, but initial J is 0. So that can't work. So even if the state were possible, the angular momentum wouldn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: The initial total J is 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final, and X has j. So J_initial = J_final + j → 0 = J_final + j → J_final = -j.

So the magnitudes must satisfy |J_final| = |j|.

So for each option, the final NN's J must equal j in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But J is a vector, so the magnitudes must match, but the direction would have to cancel out. So for example, if X has j=1, then NN must have J_final=1, but in the opposite direction. But the magnitude is 1.

But the problem is that the option states the term symbol of the final NN state. So the term symbol gives J. So for example, option A: the final state is 7D1, which has J=1. So X must have j=1. So J_final=1, j=1. So 1 +1 =2→ but initial J is 0, so that's impossible. So this option is invalid.

Similarly, let's check all options.

Option A: X l=1 → j=1. Final NN J=1. So J_final + j = 1 +1=2≠0. So invalid.

Option B: X is p → l=0 → j=0. Final NN is 3S1, J=1. So j=0, J_final=1 → 1 +0=1≠0. So J not conserved. So this is invalid.

Wait, but option B says 3S1, which is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 is S=1, L=0, J=1. X is p (l=0, j=0). So J_initial=0. J_final=1, j=0. So 1 +0=1≠0. So this doesn't conserve J. So option B is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B is valid because X's l is even. Wait, no, X's l is 0 (even), so parity is correct. But angular momentum isn't conserved here. So that makes option B invalid, but earlier I thought it was allowed because T=0.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to approach this systematically.

Each option gives the final state of NN and the type of X emitted. For each, we need to check:

1. X's l: must be even (because X's parity is -1).

2. Angular momentum conservation: J_initial (0) = J_final (NN) + j (X).

3. Parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) = 1 (since initial parity is 1).

Wait, no, let's recompute parity. The parity after emission is (parity of final NN) * (parity of X) = initial parity (1).

Parity of final NN is (-1)^{L_final}.

Parity of X is (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) (intrinsic parity of X is -1).

So:

(-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) =1.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L_final + Lx +1} =1 → L_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_final + Lx must be odd.

So for each option, L_final and Lx must be of opposite parity.

Additionally, X's Lx must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: X is D (l=1, which is odd) → invalid because Lx must be even.

Option B: X is S (l=0, even). So Lx=0, which is okay.

The final NN state is 3S1 → L_final=0 (S state). So L_final=0 (even), Lx=0 (even). So L_final + Lx =0 +0=0 → even. But from parity conservation, L_final + Lx must be odd. So this doesn't match. So parity is not conserved. So option B is invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3, which is odd) → invalid.

Option D: X is S (l=0, even). Final NN state is 3P0 → L_final=1 (P state). L_final=1 (odd), Lx=0 (even). Sum is 1, which is odd → parity conserved.

So for option D:

- Lx=0 (even) → X's parity is correct.

- L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum is 1 (odd) → parity condition satisfied.

- Angular momentum: X has l=0, so j=0 (since it's a scalar particle, assuming X is a pion with spin 0). So j=0.

The final NN state has J=0 (since term is 3P0 → J is 0). So J_final=0, j=0. So 0 +0=0 → J conserved.

So option D satisfies both angular momentum and parity conservation.

So option D is allowed.

Now, looking at the options, the invalid ones are A, B, and C.

Wait, no.

Wait, option B: X's l=0 (even), so parity is correct. But L_final + Lx =0 +0=0 → even, which doesn't satisfy the parity condition (needs to be odd). So parity is not conserved. So option B is invalid.

Option A: X's l=1 → invalid.

Option C: X's l=3 → invalid.

So only option D is valid.

The question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options that are invalid are A,B,C. But let me re-examine each.

Wait, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the particle X's partial wave is given in the options as the lowercase letter. So in option A, X is in D (l=1). Since l must be even, this is not permitted.

Similarly, option C: X in F (l=3), which is odd→ not permitted.

But the question asks which option is not permitted. So the answer could be any of A, B, C, or D? No, because D is permitted.

Wait, the question is about the partial wave of X. So each option's X has a certain l. The ones with l even are allowed; the ones with l odd are not.

So options A (D, l=1), C (F, l=3) are invalid because l is odd. Option B (S, l=0) is allowed if other conditions are met.

But wait, in option B, even though X's l is allowed, the angular momentum isn't conserved.

Because X has j=0 (since l=0 and s=0 for pion?), and the final NN state has J=1. So J_final + j =1 +0=1≠0. So angular momentum not conserved. So option B's process is impossible even though X's l is even.

So for the problem, which partial wave is not permitted? The partial wave refers to X's l. So the options where X's l is odd (A and C) are invalid. But option B's X's l is even, but angular momentum isn't conserved. But the question is about the partial wave not permitted because of parity. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but the problem says to consider both conservation of angular momentum and parity.

So the invalid options are A, B, C. Only D is valid.

But wait, the problem statement says that the final NN state has T=0. For each option, we must also verify that T=0.

So for the final state of NN, T must be 0.

Earlier, we found that T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

In option D: final state is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. So T =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1 → but T must be 0. So this would make T=1, which is invalid. So option D's final state has T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0.

Hmm, this complicates things. So even though option D's X has correct l and parity and angular momentum is conserved, the final state's T is 1, but the problem requires T=0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, so let's reevaluate:

If the final state's T must be 0, then S + L must be 1 mod 2.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → 0 mod2. So T= (1+1+1) mod2= 3 mod2=1≠0→ not allowed.

So option D is invalid.

Which leaves us with option B.

In option B: the final state is 3S1. S=1, L=0. So S + L=1 → T=(1+0 +1) mod2=0. So T=0, which is correct.

But angular momentum: X has l=0, j=0. Final NN's J=1. So J_final=1, j=0. So 1 +0=1≠0. So angular momentum not conserved.

So option B is invalid.

Wait, but the initial J is 0. So the sum of final J and X's j must be zero. So J_final + j =0.

In option B, J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0.

So option B is invalid.

So now, the only possible option that could be valid is none? Because all options seem invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me try to re-express the problem.

Given the initial state is 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0), emit X with parity -1.

The final NN state has T=0. From T= S + L +1 mod2 → 0= S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1.

X must have even Lx to have parity -1.

Parity conservation: L_final + Lx must be odd.

Angular momentum conservation: J_final (NN) + j (X) =0. So j must be equal and opposite to J_final.

So for each option:

Option A: X is D (l=1, j=1). Final NN:7D1 → impossible S=3. So invalid.

Option B: X is S (l=0, j=0). Final NN:3S1 (S=1, L=0, J=1). T=1+0+1 mod2=0. So T=0.

J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0. So invalid.

Option C: X is F (l=3, j=3). But l=3 is odd→ invalid.

Option D: X is S (l=0, j=0). Final NN:3P0 (S=1, L=1, J=0). T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1→ invalid.

Wait, but J_final in option D is 0. So j must be 0. X's j=0.

So J_final =0, j=0 → sum=0, which is correct.

But T for option D is 1, which is not allowed. So option D is invalid.

So none of the options except perhaps none are valid? But the question says which is not permitted, implying one is the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the J calculation for the final state.

Let's see:

In option D: 3P0. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3P0 → (2*1+1)=3, L=P=1, J=0.

So J_final=0.

X's j=0.

So J_final +j=0 → correct.

Parity:

L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum=1, which is odd. So (-1)^{1+0 +1} = (-1)^2=1 → parity conserved.

T for option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → mod 2=0. So T= (0 +1) mod2=1→ can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod2. So in the final state, T=0. So for each option, we must have S + L =1 mod2.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → mod2=0 → T=0+1=1 mod2→ T=1. Doesn't fit.

Thus, option D is invalid.

So the only options which have X's l even and S + L=1 are option B and any other?

Wait, let's see:

Looking for options where:

1. X's l is even.

2. Final NN's S + L =1 mod2.

3. L_final + Lx is odd.

4. J_final + j =0.

Let me see which options meet all criteria.

Option B:

X l=0 (even).

Final NN:3S1 → S=1, L=0 → S+L=1 → T=0 (correct).

L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0 (even). But parity conservation requires L_final + Lx must be odd. So parity not conserved. So invalid.

Option D:

X l=0.

Final NN:3P0 → S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → T=1 (wrong).

So even though parity is conserved (L_final=1 + Lx=0=1, which is odd), T isn't correct.

So no options meet all the criteria.

But the problem must have an answer. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the term symbol for X is different. Maybe the problem states that the term symbol is for the NN system, and X is a separate particle. So X's term symbol is given by the lowercase letter, which is its orbital angular momentum.

So for each option, the X has l as per the lowercase letter.

So for option D: X is s (l=0).

Thus, in option D, X's parity is (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1, which is correct.

Parity of NN after emission is (-1)^{L_final}.

Parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1).

So overall parity: (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.

This must equal initial parity (1).

So L_final + l +1 must be even → L_final + l must be odd.

In option D: L_final=1 (P state), l=0 → sum=1 (odd) → parity conserved.

J_final=0, j=0 → angular momentum conserved.

T= S + L +1 mod2 → S=1, L=1 → 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1 → T=1, which doesn't match the required T=0.

So option D is invalid.

Option B: l=0.

L_final=0 → L_final + l =0 → even. So parity not conserved. So invalid.

Only option left is A and C, but their X's l are odd, so X's parity would be (-1)^{l}*(-1)= (-1)^{even}*(-1)= 1*(-1)=-1 → which is correct. So for l=1: parity is (-1)^{1}*(-1) = (-1)*(-1)=1? Wait, wait:

Wait, X's parity is (-1)^Lx * intrinsic_parity. So intrinsic parity is -1.

For option A: Lx=1 → parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1)=1. But X must have parity -1. So this is incorrect. So option A's X's parity is +1, which is not allowed. So option A is invalid.

Similarly, option C: X's l=3 → parity is (-1)^3*(-1)= (-1)*(-1)=1 → invalid.

So the only option where X's parity is correct is when l is even.

But none of the options with l even satisfy T=0 and angular momentum conservation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the T condition.

The problem statement says: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2).

Wait, is that correct? Or is it T = S + L +1 mod2?

Wait, the problem says: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

So T = S + L +1 mod2.

In option B, T would be 1+0+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

But angular momentum is not conserved.

So, option B's final state has T=0, but angular momentum isn't conserved.

So the only option that meets all conditions is none, but since the problem must have an answer, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the orbital angular momentum in the reaction.

The initial state has L=0. When the NN emit X, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN and X must satisfy L_final + Lx = L_initial → 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero. So after emission, the orbital angular momentum of the final NN and X must sum to zero.

So L_final (NN) + Lx (X) = 0 (vectorially).

Which in magnitude would mean that L_final = Lx, but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite.

So for example, if X has Lx=0, then L_final must be 0.

If X has Lx=1, L_final must be 1.

But since the initial state's L is zero, this is the only way to conserve angular momentum.

So for each option:

Option A: X l=1 → Lx=1. So L_final=1. So the final NN's L must be 1.

The term for the final NN is 7D1 → L=2 (D=2) → no, because L_final must be 1. So this is invalid.

Option B: X l=0 → Lx=0. So L_final=0. The term is 3S1 → L=0 → correct.

So this satisfies L conservation.

But earlier, in option B, J_final=1, j=0 → sum=1≠0. So J not conserved.

So even though L is conserved, J is not.

So option B is invalid.

Option C: X l=3 → Lx=3. So L_final=3. The final state is 3D3 → L=2 → invalid.

Option D: X l=0 → L_final=0. The final state is 3P0 → L=1→ invalid.

So only option B has L_final=0, which matches Lx=0. But J not conserved.

Hmm, but I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D.

The correct answer is the option where either X's l is odd (so parity is wrong), or the conservation laws are not met.

So the invalid options are:

A: X l=1 → parity correct? No. Because X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1)=1. But X needs parity -1. So this is incorrect.

B: X l=0 → parity correct. But J not conserved.

C: X l=3 → parity correct? No. Because (-1)^3*(-1)=1. So parity is +1, which is incorrect.

D: X l=0 → parity correct. J conserved. T=1≠0.

So options A and C have X's parity incorrect. So they are invalid. Options B and D have X's parity correct but other issues.

The question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the partial wave refers to X's l.

Thus, any option where X's l is odd would have parity +1 (since (-1)^{l}*(-1) = (-1)^{l+1}, and if l is odd, l+1 is even → parity +1), which is incorrect because X's parity must be -1.

So options A and C have X's l odd → their X's parity would be +1, which is invalid. So these options are invalid.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is either A or C. But the options give these as options A and C.

The question says 'which of the following partial waves is not permitted'.

So the answer is one of the options where X's l is odd.

Between options A and C, both are invalid because their X's l is odd.

But the problem gives four options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. When X is emitted, the NN and X's angular momenta must sum to zero.

So for each option, the emitted X's j must be equal and opposite to the NN's J.

So for option B: X is p (l=0, j=0). NN's J=1. So j=0 can't cancel J=1. So invalid.

Option D: X j=0. NN's J=0. So 0+0=0 → valid.

But in option D, T=1, which is not allowed. So it's invalid.

So the only options with X's l even are B and D. But both are invalid for other reasons.

So looking back, the only options where X's l is even are B and D. But both have issues.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer must be one of the options with X's l odd (A and C), which have parity +1, which is invalid.

But the problem states that X's parity is -1. So options with X's l odd have parity +1 → invalid.

So the invalid options are A and C.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So among the options, the ones with X's l even are permitted, and the ones with l odd are not.

Thus, the answer is either A or C. But looking at the options:

Option A: X is p in D (l=1) → parity +1 → invalid.

Option C: X is f in F (l=3) → parity +1 → invalid.

The question is which is not permitted. So both A and C are invalid, but the options don't allow for multiple answers.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The question is about the NN emitting X, and the options describe the transition.

In option B: the final state is 3S1, which has J=1. But the initial J is 0. So J not conserved, which is a problem.

But the question says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

So the only option where both parity and angular momentum are conserved, and T=0 is option D.

But in option D, T=1, which is not allowed. So no option meets all conditions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the T calculation. Let me re-express T:

Problem states: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod2.

So T = (S + L +1) mod2.

In option B: S=1, L=0 → T=1+0+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

In option B, X's l=0, which is even → parity correct.

L_final=0, Lx=0 → L_final + Lx=0 → even. But parity must be conserved, which requires L_final + Lx +1 even → 0 +0 +1=1 → odd. So parity not conserved.

So option B is invalid.

Only option D: T=1→ invalid.

Thus, the only options that meet X's l even and parity conserved are none. But the problem must have an answer.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the T condition. Maybe the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2, but perhaps it's (S + L) +1 mod2.

Yes, that's how the problem states it: T = S + L +1 mod2.

So in option D: S=1, L=1 → T=1+1 +1=3 mod2=1→ no.

In option B: S=1, L=0 → T=1+0 +1=2 mod2=0→ yes.

So option B meets T condition.

But L_final + Lx=0 +0=0 → even. So parity condition not met.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus solely on the parity condition and Pauli's condition.

The correct answer must be the option where X's l is odd (invalid) or other conditions not met.

Given the options, the answer is likely option A, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, looking for the answer.

The possible options with X's l even are B and D. But their other conditions are not met.

The options where X's l is odd (A and C) have X's parity incorrect.

So the partial wave not permitted is where X's l is odd. So options A and C are invalid.

But the problem gives four options, and only one is correct.

Looking back at the options:

The correct answer is the one where X's l is odd, making it invalid. So the answer is either A or C.

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is D, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of parity.

Let me re-calculate X's parity.

X's parity is (-1)^Lx * intrinsic_parity.

Intrinsic_parity of X is -1.

So X's parity is (-1)^l * (-1).

We are told that X has parity -1.

So:

(-1)^l * (-1) = -1 → (-1)^l = 1 → l even.

So X's l must be even.

Thus, options with l odd (A and C) have X's parity =1, which is invalid.

So the answer is the option where X's l is odd, which are A and C.

But the problem requires selecting one option.

Looking at the options, which option has X's l odd and thus is not permitted?

A) l=1 → D state.

C) l=3 → F state.

So both have X's l odd → X's parity is +1, which is invalid.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is either A or C.

But looking at the options, option C is 3D3 + f. The f denotes l=3 (F state), which is odd.

So option C's X has l=3, which is odd. Thus, parity incorrect.

Thus, option C is not permitted.

But why is option A also not permitted?

The problem might have a typo, but given the options, the correct answer is likely option D.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Another approach: The correct answer should be option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each option's feasibility.

Option D: 3P0 + s → X is s (l=0), even. So X's parity is correct.

The final NN state is 3P0: S=1, L=1, J=0.

T =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1→ T=1, which is invalid.

So option D is invalid.

Thus, no option meets all conditions, but the intended answer is likely option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parity.

Wait, the parity of the entire system after emission must be 1 (same as initial). The parity is product of NN and X.

So:

Parity_after = [ (-1)^L_final ] * [ (-1)^Lx * (-1) ) ] = (-1)^{L_final + Lx} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_final + Lx +1}.

So this must equal initial parity of 1.

Thus:

(-1)^{L_final + Lx + 1} = 1 → exponent must be even.

So L_final + Lx +1 is even → L_final + Lx is odd.

So in option D: L_final=1, Lx=0 → sum=1→ odd. So parity conserved.

J_final=0, j=0 → J conserved.

T=1+1 +1=3 mod2=1→ invalid.

So option D is invalid.

Thus, the only options that have X's l even and L_final + Lx odd are B and D.

But B has L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0→ even. So parity not conserved.

So the only option that has X's l even and parity conserved is D, but D's T is incorrect.

Thus, no options are valid, but the question must have an answer.

Alternative thought: Perhaps the problem uses a different convention for T. Alternatively, maybe the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that T is the isospin of the NN system, which for two nucleons can be 0 or 1.

The initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0 → T =0 +0 +1=1 mod2=1.

The final state must have T=0.

So for the final state, T= S + L +1=0 mod2 → S + L=1 mod2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity.

Additionally, X's l must be even.

So for each option, let me compute S, L and check.

Option A: final state 7D1 → S=3 (invalid), so impossible.

Option B: final state 3S1 → S=1, L=0 → S+L=1→ T=0 mod2. Correct.

X's l=0→ even. So parity is (-1)^0 * (-1) =-1 → correct.

L_final=0, Lx=0 → sum=0→ even. So parity_after = (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * (-1) = (-1)^0 * (-1) → wait, no:

Wait, parity_after = (-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^Lx * (-1) ) ].

So for option B: (-1)^0 * [ (-1)^0 * (-1) ) ] = 1 * [1*(-1)] = -1. But initial parity is 1. So parity_after is -1, which doesn't match.

Thus, option B is invalid.

Option C: X's l=3 → invalid.

Option D: final state 3P0 → S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 mod2=0 → T= (0 +1) mod2 → T=1→ invalid.

Thus, only option B has T correct but parity incorrect. Option D has T incorrect but parity correct.

Thus, the only valid options are none.

But the question must have an answer. I think I'm overcomplicating.

The intended answer is likely option D, but based on the conditions, it's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D because it's the only one where X's l is even and the other conditions are met except T, but the problem requires T=0.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the question asks which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial NN state is 1S0, with \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The isospin of the initial state is \( T_{\text{initial}} = (S + L + 1) \, (\text{mod} \, 2) = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \). Using the condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), this implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Thus, \( S(NN) \) and \( L(NN) \) must be of opposite parity.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state is 1. After emission, the parity of the system is the product of the parities of the final NN state and X. The parity of X is given as -1, and the parity of the final NN state is \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \). Thus:
   \[
   (-1)^{L(NN)} \cdot (-1)^{L(X)} \cdot (-1) = 1 \implies L(NN) + L(X) + 1 \, \text{is even} \implies L(NN) + L(X) \, \text{is odd}.
   \]
   Since \( L(X) \) must be even (to ensure X's parity is -1), \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum before and after emission must be conserved. The initial state has \( J = 0 \), so the total angular momentum after emission, \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X \), must also sum to zero. This implies \( J_{\text{final}} = -j_X \), and their magnitudes must match.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \) implies \( S = 3 \), which is impossible for two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles).  
  - Additionally, \( L(X) = 1 \) (D state), which is odd. Since \( L(X) \) must be even, this option is invalid.

- **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 0 \), \( J = 1 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
  - \( L(X) = 0 \) (S state), which is even, so X's parity is correct.  
  - However, angular momentum is not conserved: \( J_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( j_X = 0 \), so \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X = 1 \neq 0 \).  
  - This option is invalid.

- **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 2 \), \( J = 3 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
  - \( L(X) = 3 \) (F state), which is odd. Since \( L(X) \) must be even, this option is invalid.

- **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)  
  - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \) implies \( S = 1 \), \( L = 1 \), \( J = 0 \).  
  - \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 1 \), which does not satisfy \( T = 0 \).  
  - \( L(X) = 0 \) (S state), which is even, so X's parity is correct.  
  - Angular momentum is conserved: \( J_{\text{final}} = 0 \), \( j_X = 0 \), so \( J_{\text{final}} + j_X = 0 \).  
  - This option is invalid due to the isospin condition.

### Conclusion:
The only options where \( L(X) \) is even (valid parity for X) are B and D. However, both fail due to angular momentum or isospin conservation. The options where \( L(X) \) is odd (invalid parity for X) are A and C. Among these, **Option A** is the most clearly invalid because \( L(X) = 1 \) (D state) results in X's parity being +1, which contradicts the given intrinsic parity of -1.
