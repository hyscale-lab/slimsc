Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Since the quasar emits this light, but the hydrogen clouds absorb it. So if the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength would be stretched, right?

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * (1 + z). But wait, in this case, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the light we receive from the quasar would have the Lyman alpha line absorbed by the cloud. Wait no, actually, the cloud is in front, so the quasar's light passes through it, and the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms.

Wait wait, but the observed wavelength from the quasar would have that absorption line shifted. So the quasar itself must have a redshift such that when the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the quasar, it's observed at a wavelength that's longer than 1216 Angstroms. Wait no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms in its own rest frame. But if the quasar is moving away, that photon would be redshifted. The hydrogen cloud, if it's at a higher redshift than the quasar, would absorb that photon. Or wait, no — if the cloud is between us and the quasar, then the photon emitted by the quasar at 1216 Angstroms (in quasar's frame) would have a longer wavelength in our frame if the quasar is moving away. But the hydrogen in the cloud would absorb it at the cloud's rest frame. So the observed wavelength is lambda_quasar = 1216*(1 + z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. But the cloud is at a redshift z_c, so the wavelength absorbed by the cloud would be 1216*(1 + z_c). For the absorption to happen, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must match the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the photon emitted by the quasar must have wavelength 1216*(1 + z_c) in the cloud's frame, which would be 1216*(1 + z_q) in our frame.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The quasar emits light with the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. If the cloud is at a higher redshift (z_cloud > z_quasar?), then when the photon passes through the cloud, it's blueshifted relative to the cloud's frame, which would cause the cloud to absorb it. Wait no, redshift and blueshifts can get confusing.

Alternatively, the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own motion, and the absorption line from the cloud is at a different redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the observed wavelength from the ground-based telescope. The quasar's Lyman alpha emission, if it's at z=0, would be 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, the emitted 1216 Angstroms would be observed at a longer wavelength.

But the problem here is about detecting the absorption line. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at a certain observed wavelength. For ground-based optical telescopes, what's the maximum wavelength they can observe? Because if the observed wavelength is beyond what optical can detect, we can't see it.

Optical telescopes can typically observe up to around 1 micrometer (10000 Angstroms), I think. So if the Lyman alpha absorption line after redshift is in the optical range, then we can detect it.

So the condition is that the observed wavelength (lambda) = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) must be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength, say 10000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So when is the observed wavelength just entering the optical range?

Wait, wait. No, because higher redshifts mean longer wavelengths. So if the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) <= 10000 Angstroms (since beyond that is infrared, which optical telescopes can't see). So solving for z:

1216*(1 + z) <= 10000
1 + z <= 10000 / 1216
Calculate that: 10000 / 1216 ≈ 8.224. So 1 + z ≈ 8.224 → z ≈ 7.224. But that can't be right because the options don't go that high. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, wait a second. The quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's rest frame. If the quasar is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). If the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, then the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha would be blueshifted in the cloud's frame. But that's only if the cloud is moving towards us compared to the quasar. Wait, perhaps the cloud is at a redshift higher than the quasar. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so if the cloud is at a higher z than the quasar, then when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission (at 1216 Angstroms in quasar's frame) would be blueshifted to a shorter wavelength in the cloud's frame. But the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, so the quasar's emitted wavelength must be 1216 in the cloud's frame. Wait, that would mean that the quasar's emission is at a wavelength of 1216/(1 + z_cloud) in our frame? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as the observed wavelength from Earth. The quasar emits Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud is at some redshift z. The quasar's emission is redshifted by z_q, so observed wavelength is λ = 1216*(1 + z_q). But the cloud is at a higher redshift, z_c > z_q. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at a wavelength λ_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_c). For that to be in the optical range (i.e., 1216*(1 + z_c) ≤ 10000 Angstroms), then (1 + z_c) ≤ 10000/1216 ≈8.224 → z_c ≈7.224. But that's way higher than the options. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's light being absorbed by the cloud. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our observed frame. But if that wavelength is in the optical range, which is up to ~10000 Angstroms, then 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <= 10000 → z_cloud <= ~7.2. But again, that doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's own emission line being redshifted. If the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but the cloud's absorption is at a higher wavelength. Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: To detect the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So the condition is that the Lyman alpha absorption line's observed wavelength λ_obs must be ≤ 10000 Angstroms. Because beyond that, it's infrared, which optical telescopes can't see.

The Lyman alpha wavelength when observed is λ_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the cloud.

So set 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000 → 1 + z ≤ 10000/1216 ≈8.224 → z ≤ ~7.22. But the options are much lower. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the quasar's redshift.

Wait, maybe the quasar itself is at a certain redshift, and the cloud is in front of it. So the cloud's redshift is higher than the quasar's. Therefore, the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would have a higher redshift than the quasar's emission line.

But in that case, the quasar's own emission line (Lyman alpha) is at z_q, so λ_emitted = 1216*(1 + z_q), which would be observed at that wavelength. But the cloud is at z_c > z_q, so the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c). The absorption line must be in the optical range for us to detect it. So 1216*(1 + z_c) <= 10000 → z_c <= ~7.22 again. But this doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is about detecting the quasar's light through the hydrogen cloud—so the absorption line would be at the quasar's redshift plus the cloud's. Or perhaps it's about the quasar's emission being redshifted beyond the optical range, but the absorption line occurs at a lower wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) is in the optical range. So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000. Which gives z ≤ (10000/1216)-1 ≈7.22, but that's way higher than the options.

Wait, maybe the question is about the quasar's light not being absorbed. Or perhaps it's about the quasar's light being absorbed, and we seeing the absorption line in the optical.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission line would be shifted into the optical range. But if the cloud is in front, then the absorption would occur at a different wavelength.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

The question states that the hydrogen clouds absorb the light at Lyman alpha (~1216 Angstroms). So the quasar emits the light, including the Lyman alpha line, and the cloud absorbs that specific wavelength. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. When the quasar is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). But for the cloud to cause absorption at that same wavelength, the cloud must be at the same redshift as the quasar. Or wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the cloud could be at a higher redshift, causing the Lyman alpha line to be observed at a longer wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical range. So the cloud's redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000, because beyond that, the wavelength is in the infrared and not detectable by optical telescopes.

So solving for z:

(1 + z) ≤ 10000 / 1216 ≈8.224 → z ≤ ~7.22. But the options are all way below that. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe the problem is different.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's emission is in the optical, and the cloud's absorption is at a higher wavelength. Wait, no.

Wait, another angle: The quasar's light is in the optical, so its redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha is observed at, say, 4000 Angstroms (blue), which is in the optical. So 4000 = 1216*(1 + z) → z = (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.38. So z ≈2.38. So the quasar would be at around z=2.38 to have its Lyman alpha line in the blue part of the optical spectrum.

But the cloud's absorption is at Lyman alpha, which is at 1216 Angstroms. Wait, no—if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the quasar's light would have the Lyman alpha line redshifted beyond the optical, and the cloud would absorb it.

Wait, perhaps the cloud must have a redshift such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical, so the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is redshifted beyond the optical, but the cloud's absorption is at a lower wavelength. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. For it to be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted into the optical range. Wait no, the optical is 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is in the far ultraviolet. So for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted so that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range.

So 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms → z ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. But 4000 is in the blue part of optical. But if the quasar's Lyman alpha is redshifted beyond the optical, then the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than this. But then, the cloud's absorption would be at an even higher wavelength, which might be beyond optical.

Wait, maybe the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be z_cloud = (optical_wavelength / 1216) -1.

But for the quasar's light to pass through the cloud, the cloud must be at a higher redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is further away. So the quasar's redshift z_quasar must be less than z_cloud.

But the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar), which must be in the optical range as well, so that we can observe it. Wait, but if the quasar's emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) ≤ 10000 Angstroms, then z_quasar ≤ ~7.22 as before. But the cloud's redshift is higher, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be ≤10000. So, for the quasar's emission to be in optical, z_quasar must be such that 1216*(1 + z_quasar) is ≤10000. But the cloud's redshift is higher, so that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is also ≤10000.

But if the quasar's redshift is z, then the cloud's must be higher. So the minimal z_cloud is just above the quasar's z. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud, so that it can be detected with optical telescopes.

Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the minimal redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical, regardless of the quasar's redshift. Because if the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical, it's detectable.

So, the minimal redshift z where 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms (the start of optical). So z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.28. So z must be at least 3.28. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A)3, but there's option C) 2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, perhaps the optical range here is considered to start at 3000 Angstroms (300 nm, near UV). Let me calculate 1216*(1 + z) = 3000 → z = (3000/1216)-1 ≈ 1.468. So z ≈1.47.

Wait, but 3000 Angstroms is in the near UV, which ground-based telescopes can't observe because the atmosphere blocks UV. So optical is roughly 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) and above. So the minimal z would be when the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.28. But none of the options are above 3. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, another approach: The quasar's light is at a wavelength that's redshifted beyond the Lyman limit of the hydrogen. So when the quasar's light is at a wavelength longer than 912 Angstroms (the Lyman limit), the hydrogen can absorb it. But the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far UV. So for the cloud's Lyman alpha line to be observed, it must be redshifted into the optical.

So, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000 Angstroms → z ≤7.22 as before. But that's not helpful because the options are lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which would correspond to the highest possible wavelength that can still be observed in optical. Because if the observed wavelength is too long (like near infrared), optical telescopes can't detect it.

Wait, but the maximum wavelength optical can observe is around 10000 Angstroms. So the minimal redshift would be when the Lyman alpha line is just at the edge of optical. So 1216*(1 + z) = 10000 → z ≈ 7.22. But again, the options don't have that, so perhaps the question is misunderstanding.

Alternative approach: Maybe the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha line is in the observed optical. So 1216*(1 + z) = optical wavelength. But for the quasar to be visible, its own emission lines must be in the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission lines are in the optical. Let's say the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216*(1 + z_q) = 4000 Angstroms → z_q ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. So the quasar is at z≈3.28. Then the cloud must have a higher redshift, say z_cloud. The observed Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would be 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the cloud's redshift must be higher than the quasar's, so z_cloud >3.28.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. So the minimal z_cloud would be just above the quasar's redshift. But since the options don't include anything near 3.28, perhaps the question is considering that the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So the minimal redshift is when the Lyman alpha line is just in the optical.

Wait, perhaps the optical range is taken as 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) and above. So 1216*(1 + z) ≥4000 → z ≥ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. But none of the options are above 3. The highest option is A)3. So perhaps the minimal redshift is z=3, so option A.

But wait, the options include D)1.9, which is much lower. So maybe the reasoning is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's light is in the optical, so the quasar's redshift is such that its Lyman alpha is at the edge of the optical. Let's say the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 4000 Angstroms: z_q ≈3.28. Then the cloud is at a higher redshift, so the cloud's Lyman alpha would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >4000 Angstroms. But the cloud's absorption line must be in the optical, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤10000 → z_cloud ≤7.22.

But the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is determined by when the cloud's Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud ≈3.28. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift to be such that its own Lyman alpha is in the optical, and the cloud's redshift must be higher.

But then the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about detecting the hydrogen clouds. So the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≤ optical_max. Let's say optical_max is 7000 Angstroms (red end). So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤7000 →1 + z_cloud ≤7000/1216 ≈5.755 → z_cloud ≤4.755. So the minimal redshift would be when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical, which would be optical_min=4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≥(4000/1216)-1≈3.28. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is simpler.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the lower limit on the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Because the cloud must be in front of the quasar. So the quasar's redshift must be less than the cloud's.

Wait, but the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects", and the objects are the hydrogen clouds. So the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's redshift is z, and the cloud's redshift is z_cloud. The quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, and observed at 1216*(1+z). The cloud is in front, so z_cloud > z. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our frame.

But for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ 10000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≤7.22 as before. But the question is about the minimal redshift of the cloud, which is when z_cloud is as small as possible, but still in the optical.

Wait, but the cloud's redshift must be higher than the quasar's. So the minimal z_cloud is just above the quasar's z. But the quasar's z can be as low as possible. So perhaps the minimal z_cloud is when the quasar's z is 0, and the cloud's z is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical.

Wait, but if the quasar is at z=0, the cloud in front would have to be at higher z. Then 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be ≤10000 → z_cloud ≤7.22. But the minimal z_cloud would be when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is just in the optical, say 4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≈3.28.

But the options don't have 3.28. The closest is option A)3. So perhaps the answer is A)3.

But wait, option D is 1.9. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is 912 Angstroms. For a quasar to be seen through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the quasar's light must be redshifted beyond the Lyman limit. Otherwise, the hydrogen would absorb all the light, making the quasar invisible. So the quasar's redshift must satisfy 1216*(1 + z_quasar) >912 → z_quasar > (912/1216) -1 ≈0.742. So the quasar must be at z>0.742. But that's about the quasar, not the cloud.

But the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a higher redshift. So the cloud's z_cloud>z_quasar>0.742.

But the question is about the lower limit on the cloud's redshift. So the minimal z_cloud is when the quasar is at z_quasar just above 0.742, and the cloud is at z_cloud just above that. So the minimal z_cloud is around 0.742. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Lyman limit absorption. For the quasar to be seen, its Lyman alpha emission must be redshifted beyond the Lyman limit, so that the quasar's light isn't completely absorbed. So the quasar's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_quasar) > 912 Angstroms → 1 + z_quasar > 912/1216 → z_quasar > 0.742. So the quasar must be at z>0.742.

The cloud, being in front, is at higher z_cloud>z_quasar. So the minimal z_cloud is just above 0.742. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha line is still in the optical. So the minimal redshift is when the line is just entering the optical. So:

1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 → z_cloud ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the absorption line is in the quasar's rest frame, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, and we observe it at a longer wavelength due to the cloud's redshift.

Wait, that's correct. So the cloud's Lyman alpha is at 1216 in its own frame. The observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For this to be in the optical, it must be ≤10000 Angstroms.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud≈3.28. So the lower limit is z_cloud ≥3.28. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. Since 3.28 is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, and for it to be redshifted into the optical (which starts at ~3000 Angstroms perhaps?), so:

1216*(1 + z_cloud) =3000 → z_cloud = (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.468.

So z_cloud must be ≥1.47. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9. So 1.9 is the smallest option above 1.47, so the lower limit would be z_cloud ≥1.9.

So the correct answer would be D)1.9.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If the observed optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms (which is 300 nm, near UV), then the Lyman alpha line must be observed at 3000 or longer.

So 1216*(1 + z) ≥3000 → z ≥(3000/1216) -1 ≈1.468. So z_cloud must be at least about 1.47. So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. Among the options, D)1.9 is the smallest option that's higher than 1.47. So the lower limit would be approximately 1.47, and the option is D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the optical is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Let me compute that.

1216*(1 + z) =4000 → z=(4000/1216)-1≈3.28. So z must be at least 3.28, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the problem considers the optical to start at 3000 Angstroms.

So the minimal z_cloud is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So the next option is D)1.9, which is the smallest option above 1.47. Therefore, the correct answer is D)1.9.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of the hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the conditions under which the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths between approximately 4000 Å (400 nm, blue light) and 10000 Å (1000 nm, near-infrared). 

The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z)
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z) \leq 10000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \leq \frac{10000}{1216} \approx 8.224 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \leq 7.22
\]

This calculation shows that the hydrogen cloud's redshift must be less than or equal to approximately 7.22 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range. However, the question asks for the **lower limit** on the redshift, which corresponds to the smallest redshift at which the Lyman alpha line is still detectable in the optical range.

Assuming the optical range starts at 4000 Å (400 nm), we calculate the minimal redshift as:

\[
1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z) = 4000 \, \text{Å} \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.28
\]

Thus, the hydrogen cloud must have a redshift \( z \geq 3.28 \) for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range. However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. The closest option is **A) 3**, which is slightly below the calculated value but reasonable as a lower limit.

Given the options, the most appropriate choice is:

**A) 3**

This corresponds to the smallest redshift at which the Lyman alpha line is still detectable in the optical range, assuming the optical range begins at 4000 Å.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Since the quasar emits this light, but the hydrogen clouds absorb it. So if the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength would be stretched, right?

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * (1 + z). But wait, in this case, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the light we receive from the quasar would have the Lyman alpha line absorbed by the cloud. Wait no, actually, the cloud is in front, so the quasar's light passes through it, and the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms.

Wait wait, but the observed wavelength from the quasar would have that absorption line shifted. So the quasar itself must have a redshift such that when the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the quasar, it's observed at a wavelength that's longer than 1216 Angstroms. Wait no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms in its own rest frame. But if the quasar is moving away, that photon would be redshifted. The hydrogen cloud, if it's at a higher redshift than the quasar, would absorb that photon. Or wait, no — if the cloud is between us and the quasar, then the photon emitted by the quasar at 1216 Angstroms (in quasar's frame) would have a longer wavelength in our frame if the quasar is moving away. But the hydrogen in the cloud would absorb it at the cloud's rest frame. So the observed wavelength is lambda_quasar = 1216*(1 + z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. But the cloud is at a redshift z_c, so the wavelength absorbed by the cloud would be 1216*(1 + z_c). For the absorption to happen, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must match the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the photon emitted by the quasar must have wavelength 1216*(1 + z_c) in the cloud's frame, which would be 1216*(1 + z_q) in our frame.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The quasar emits light with the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. If the cloud is at a higher redshift (z_cloud > z_quasar?), then when the photon passes through the cloud, it's blueshifted relative to the cloud's frame, which would cause the cloud to absorb it. Wait no, redshift and blueshifts can get confusing.

Alternatively, the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own motion, and the absorption line from the cloud is at a different redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the observed wavelength from the ground-based telescope. The quasar's Lyman alpha emission, if it's at z=0, would be 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, the emitted 1216 Angstroms would be observed at a longer wavelength.

But the problem here is about detecting the absorption line. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at a certain observed wavelength. For ground-based optical telescopes, what's the maximum wavelength they can observe? Because if the observed wavelength is beyond what optical can detect, we can't see it.

Optical telescopes can typically observe up to around 1 micrometer (10000 Angstroms), I think. So if the Lyman alpha absorption line after redshift is in the optical range, then we can detect it.

So the condition is that the observed wavelength (lambda) = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) must be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength, say 10000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So when is the observed wavelength just entering the optical range?

Wait, wait. No, because higher redshifts mean longer wavelengths. So if the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) <= 10000 Angstroms (since beyond that is infrared, which optical telescopes can't see). So solving for z:

1216*(1 + z) <= 10000
1 + z <= 10000 / 1216
Calculate that: 10000 / 1216 ≈ 8.224. So 1 + z ≈ 8.224 → z ≈ 7.224. But that can't be right because the options don't go that high. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, wait a second. The quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's rest frame. If the quasar is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). If the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, then the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha would be blueshifted in the cloud's frame. But that's only if the cloud is moving towards us compared to the quasar. Wait, perhaps the cloud is at a redshift higher than the quasar. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so if the cloud is at a higher z than the quasar, then when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission (at 1216 Angstroms in quasar's frame) would be blueshifted to a shorter wavelength in the cloud's frame. But the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, so the quasar's emitted wavelength must be 1216 in the cloud's frame. Wait, that would mean that the quasar's emission is at a wavelength of 1216/(1 + z_cloud) in our frame? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as the observed wavelength from Earth. The quasar emits Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud is at some redshift z. The quasar's emission is redshifted by z_q, so observed wavelength is λ = 1216*(1 + z_q). But the cloud is at a higher redshift, z_c > z_q. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at a wavelength λ_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_c). For that to be in the optical range (i.e., 1216*(1 + z_c) ≤ 10000 Angstroms), then (1 + z_c) ≤ 10000/1216 ≈8.224 → z_c ≈7.224. But that's way higher than the options. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's light being absorbed by the cloud. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our observed frame. But if that wavelength is in the optical range, which is up to ~10000 Angstroms, then 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <= 10000 → z_cloud <= ~7.2. But again, that doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's own emission line being redshifted. If the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but the cloud's absorption is at a higher wavelength. Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: To detect the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So the condition is that the Lyman alpha absorption line's observed wavelength λ_obs must be ≤ 10000 Angstroms. Because beyond that, it's infrared, which optical telescopes can't see.

The Lyman alpha wavelength when observed is λ_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the cloud.

So set 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000 → 1 + z ≤ 10000/1216 ≈8.224 → z ≤ ~7.22. But the options are much lower. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the quasar's redshift.

Wait, maybe the quasar itself is at a certain redshift, and the cloud is in front of it. So the cloud's redshift is higher than the quasar's. Therefore, the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would have a higher redshift than the quasar's emission line.

But in that case, the quasar's own emission line (Lyman alpha) is at z_q, so λ_emitted = 1216*(1 + z_q), which would be observed at that wavelength. But the cloud is at z_c > z_q, so the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c). The absorption line must be in the optical range for us to detect it. So 1216*(1 + z_c) <= 10000 → z_c <= ~7.22 again. But this doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is about detecting the quasar's light through the hydrogen cloud—so the absorption line would be at the quasar's redshift plus the cloud's. Or perhaps it's about the quasar's emission being redshifted beyond the optical range, but the absorption line occurs at a lower wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) is in the optical range. So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000. Which gives z ≤ (10000/1216)-1 ≈7.22, but that's way higher than the options.

Wait, maybe the question is about the quasar's light not being absorbed. Or perhaps it's about the quasar's light being absorbed, and we seeing the absorption line in the optical.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission line would be shifted into the optical range. But if the cloud is in front, then the absorption would occur at a different wavelength.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

The question states that the hydrogen clouds absorb the light at Lyman alpha (~1216 Angstroms). So the quasar emits the light, including the Lyman alpha line, and the cloud absorbs that specific wavelength. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. When the quasar is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). But for the cloud to cause absorption at that same wavelength, the cloud must be at the same redshift as the quasar. Or wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the cloud could be at a higher redshift, causing the Lyman alpha line to be observed at a longer wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical range. So the cloud's redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000, because beyond that, the wavelength is in the infrared and not detectable by optical telescopes.

So solving for z:

(1 + z) ≤ 10000 / 1216 ≈8.224 → z ≤ ~7.22. But the options are all way below that. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe the problem is different.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's emission is in the optical, and the cloud's absorption is at a higher wavelength. Wait, no.

Wait, another angle: The quasar's light is in the optical, so its redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha is observed at, say, 4000 Angstroms (blue), which is in the optical. So 4000 = 1216*(1 + z) → z = (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.38. So z ≈2.38. So the quasar would be at around z=2.38 to have its Lyman alpha line in the blue part of the optical spectrum.

But the cloud's absorption is at Lyman alpha, which is at 1216 Angstroms. Wait, no—if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the quasar's light would have the Lyman alpha line redshifted beyond the optical, and the cloud would absorb it.

Wait, perhaps the cloud must have a redshift such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical, so the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is redshifted beyond the optical, but the cloud's absorption is at a lower wavelength. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. For it to be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted into the optical range. Wait no, the optical is 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is in the far ultraviolet. So for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted so that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range.

So 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms → z ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. But 4000 is in the blue part of optical. But if the quasar's Lyman alpha is redshifted beyond the optical, then the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than this. But then, the cloud's absorption would be at an even higher wavelength, which might be beyond optical.

Wait, maybe the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be z_cloud = (optical_wavelength / 1216) -1.

But for the quasar's light to pass through the cloud, the cloud must be at a higher redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is further away. So the quasar's redshift z_quasar must be less than z_cloud.

But the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar), which must be in the optical range as well, so that we can observe it. Wait, but if the quasar's emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) ≤ 10000 Angstroms, then z_quasar ≤ ~7.22 as before. But the cloud's redshift is higher, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be ≤10000. So, for the quasar's emission to be in optical, z_quasar must be such that 1216*(1 + z_quasar) is ≤10000. But the cloud's redshift is higher, so that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is also ≤10000.

But if the quasar's redshift is z, then the cloud's must be higher. So the minimal z_cloud is just above the quasar's z. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud, so that it can be detected with optical telescopes.

Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the minimal redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical, regardless of the quasar's redshift. Because if the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical, it's detectable.

So, the minimal redshift z where 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms (the start of optical). So z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.28. So z must be at least 3.28. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A)3, but there's option C) 2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, perhaps the optical range here is considered to start at 3000 Angstroms (300 nm, near UV). Let me calculate 1216*(1 + z) = 3000 → z = (3000/1216)-1 ≈ 1.468. So z ≈1.47.

Wait, but 3000 Angstroms is in the near UV, which ground-based telescopes can't observe because the atmosphere blocks UV. So optical is roughly 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) and above. So the minimal z would be when the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.28. But none of the options are above 3. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, another approach: The quasar's light is at a wavelength that's redshifted beyond the Lyman limit of the hydrogen. So when the quasar's light is at a wavelength longer than 912 Angstroms (the Lyman limit), the hydrogen can absorb it. But the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far UV. So for the cloud's Lyman alpha line to be observed, it must be redshifted into the optical.

So, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 10000 Angstroms → z ≤7.22 as before. But that's not helpful because the options are lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which would correspond to the highest possible wavelength that can still be observed in optical. Because if the observed wavelength is too long (like near infrared), optical telescopes can't detect it.

Wait, but the maximum wavelength optical can observe is around 10000 Angstroms. So the minimal redshift would be when the Lyman alpha line is just at the edge of optical. So 1216*(1 + z) = 10000 → z ≈ 7.22. But again, the options don't have that, so perhaps the question is misunderstanding.

Alternative approach: Maybe the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha line is in the observed optical. So 1216*(1 + z) = optical wavelength. But for the quasar to be visible, its own emission lines must be in the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission lines are in the optical. Let's say the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216*(1 + z_q) = 4000 Angstroms → z_q ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. So the quasar is at z≈3.28. Then the cloud must have a higher redshift, say z_cloud. The observed Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would be 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the cloud's redshift must be higher than the quasar's, so z_cloud >3.28.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. So the minimal z_cloud would be just above the quasar's redshift. But since the options don't include anything near 3.28, perhaps the question is considering that the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So the minimal redshift is when the Lyman alpha line is just in the optical.

Wait, perhaps the optical range is taken as 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) and above. So 1216*(1 + z) ≥4000 → z ≥ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28. But none of the options are above 3. The highest option is A)3. So perhaps the minimal redshift is z=3, so option A.

But wait, the options include D)1.9, which is much lower. So maybe the reasoning is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's light is in the optical, so the quasar's redshift is such that its Lyman alpha is at the edge of the optical. Let's say the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 4000 Angstroms: z_q ≈3.28. Then the cloud is at a higher redshift, so the cloud's Lyman alpha would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >4000 Angstroms. But the cloud's absorption line must be in the optical, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤10000 → z_cloud ≤7.22.

But the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is determined by when the cloud's Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud ≈3.28. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift to be such that its own Lyman alpha is in the optical, and the cloud's redshift must be higher.

But then the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about detecting the hydrogen clouds. So the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≤ optical_max. Let's say optical_max is 7000 Angstroms (red end). So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤7000 →1 + z_cloud ≤7000/1216 ≈5.755 → z_cloud ≤4.755. So the minimal redshift would be when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical, which would be optical_min=4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≥(4000/1216)-1≈3.28. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is simpler.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the lower limit on the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Because the cloud must be in front of the quasar. So the quasar's redshift must be less than the cloud's.

Wait, but the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects", and the objects are the hydrogen clouds. So the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's redshift is z, and the cloud's redshift is z_cloud. The quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, and observed at 1216*(1+z). The cloud is in front, so z_cloud > z. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our frame.

But for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ 10000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≤7.22 as before. But the question is about the minimal redshift of the cloud, which is when z_cloud is as small as possible, but still in the optical.

Wait, but the cloud's redshift must be higher than the quasar's. So the minimal z_cloud is just above the quasar's z. But the quasar's z can be as low as possible. So perhaps the minimal z_cloud is when the quasar's z is 0, and the cloud's z is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical.

Wait, but if the quasar is at z=0, the cloud in front would have to be at higher z. Then 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be ≤10000 → z_cloud ≤7.22. But the minimal z_cloud would be when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is just in the optical, say 4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≈3.28.

But the options don't have 3.28. The closest is option A)3. So perhaps the answer is A)3.

But wait, option D is 1.9. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is 912 Angstroms. For a quasar to be seen through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the quasar's light must be redshifted beyond the Lyman limit. Otherwise, the hydrogen would absorb all the light, making the quasar invisible. So the quasar's redshift must satisfy 1216*(1 + z_quasar) >912 → z_quasar > (912/1216) -1 ≈0.742. So the quasar must be at z>0.742. But that's about the quasar, not the cloud.

But the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a higher redshift. So the cloud's z_cloud>z_quasar>0.742.

But the question is about the lower limit on the cloud's redshift. So the minimal z_cloud is when the quasar is at z_quasar just above 0.742, and the cloud is at z_cloud just above that. So the minimal z_cloud is around 0.742. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Lyman limit absorption. For the quasar to be seen, its Lyman alpha emission must be redshifted beyond the Lyman limit, so that the quasar's light isn't completely absorbed. So the quasar's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_quasar) > 912 Angstroms → 1 + z_quasar > 912/1216 → z_quasar > 0.742. So the quasar must be at z>0.742.

The cloud, being in front, is at higher z_cloud>z_quasar. So the minimal z_cloud is just above 0.742. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha line is still in the optical. So the minimal redshift is when the line is just entering the optical. So:

1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 → z_cloud ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.28.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the absorption line is in the quasar's rest frame, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, and we observe it at a longer wavelength due to the cloud's redshift.

Wait, that's correct. So the cloud's Lyman alpha is at 1216 in its own frame. The observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For this to be in the optical, it must be ≤10000 Angstroms.

So the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud≈3.28. So the lower limit is z_cloud ≥3.28. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. Since 3.28 is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, and for it to be redshifted into the optical (which starts at ~3000 Angstroms perhaps?), so:

1216*(1 + z_cloud) =3000 → z_cloud = (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.468.

So z_cloud must be ≥1.47. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9. So 1.9 is the smallest option above 1.47, so the lower limit would be z_cloud ≥1.9.

So the correct answer would be D)1.9.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If the observed optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms (which is 300 nm, near UV), then the Lyman alpha line must be observed at 3000 or longer.

So 1216*(1 + z) ≥3000 → z ≥(3000/1216) -1 ≈1.468. So z_cloud must be at least about 1.47. So the minimal z is approximately 1.47. Among the options, D)1.9 is the smallest option that's higher than 1.47. So the lower limit would be approximately 1.47, and the option is D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the optical is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Let me compute that.

1216*(1 + z) =4000 → z=(4000/1216)-1≈3.28. So z must be at least 3.28, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the problem considers the optical to start at 3000 Angstroms.

So the minimal z_cloud is 1.47, but the options don't have that. So the next option is D)1.9, which is the smallest option above 1.47. Therefore, the correct answer is D)1.9.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of the hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the conditions under which the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths between approximately 4000 Å (400 nm, blue light) and 10000 Å (1000 nm, near-infrared). 

The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z)
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z) \leq 10000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \leq \frac{10000}{1216} \approx 8.224 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \leq 7.22
\]

This calculation shows that the hydrogen cloud's redshift must be less than or equal to approximately 7.22 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range. However, the question asks for the **lower limit** on the redshift, which corresponds to the smallest redshift at which the Lyman alpha line is still detectable in the optical range.

Assuming the optical range starts at 4000 Å (400 nm), we calculate the minimal redshift as:

\[
1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z) = 4000 \, \text{Å} \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.28
\]

Thus, the hydrogen cloud must have a redshift \( z \geq 3.28 \) for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range. However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. The closest option is **A) 3**, which is slightly below the calculated value but reasonable as a lower limit.

Given the options, the most appropriate choice is:

**A) 3**

This corresponds to the smallest redshift at which the Lyman alpha line is still detectable in the optical range, assuming the optical range begins at 4000 Å.

Answer: A
