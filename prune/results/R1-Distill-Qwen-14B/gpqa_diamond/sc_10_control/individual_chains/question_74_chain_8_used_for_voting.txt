Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, was that the case? Or does the probability accumulate over time?

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, for an atom, there's a 32% chance it will decay in the first 100 minutes after it's created. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, so the first 100 minutes is the initial period. But the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. So the remaining time we're considering is the next 150 minutes, which is 50 to 200 minutes total.

I think radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay probability is modeled by the formula N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Oh right, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by that formula. So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 minus that.

But wait, the question gives a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. That means 32% chance to decay by 100 minutes. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (100% - 32%).

So, the survival probability S(t) is 68% at t=100 minutes. S(t) = e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

I can solve for λ. Taking natural logs on both sides, ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = -(ln 0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is e^-0.415 approximately? Wait, I remember that ln(0.6931) is about -0.366, which is for half-life. Hmm. Maybe I should just approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the decay constant λ. Because the problem is about a specific atom, which either decays or doesn't. So it's about conditional probability. Given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but considering the decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in a certain time interval is independent of previous events. Oh wait, no, because each decay is an independent event. So, the survival probability up to time t is S(t) = e^(-λt). So, the probability the atom hasn't decayed by time t is S(t).

So, the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So, the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (which is 150 minutes after 50) is equal to the probability it hasn't decayed at 50 minus the probability it hasn't decayed at 200. So, S(50) - S(200) would give the probability of decay between 50 and 200.

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in any interval is only dependent on the time passed, not the past. So, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays from time 50 to 200. Which is 1 - S(200).

But we have to find S(50) and S(200) using the given information.

We know that at t=100, S(100)=0.68. So, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

We can find λ as λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

So, let's compute λ. Let me think, ln(0.68) ≈ ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ approximately, using the approximation ln(1-x) ≈ -x - x²/2 for small x. But 0.32 is not that small. Alternatively, I can compute ln(0.68) numerically. I think ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3) is about 1.098, so ln(0.68) is negative.

Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, I need to find the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 minutes, which is 50 + 150 minutes. So, S(200) = e^(-λ *200).

Plugging in λ, e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132).

What's e^-0.77132? Let me approximate. e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.77 is around 0.462, perhaps. Alternatively, 0.77132 is approximately 0.77. So, e^-0.77 ≈ 0.462.

So, S(200) ≈ 0.462.

But wait, I need to compute it more accurately perhaps. Let me think:

We have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, time t=200 minutes: λt = 0.0038566 * 200 = 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.8 ≈ 0.4493. So, 0.77132 is between 0.7 and 0.8. Let me calculate the exact value.

Let me compute it as:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around a=0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that 0.77132 = 0.7 + 0.07132.

So, e^-0.7 = approximately 0.4966.

The derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. So, the linear approximation around x=0.7 is:

e^-(0.7 + δ) ≈ e^-0.7 (1 - δ) for small δ. Hmm, but δ is 0.07132, which is about 10% of 0.7, so the approximation might not be super accurate, but let's try.

e^-0.77 ≈ 0.4966 * (1 - 0.07132) = 0.4966 * 0.92868 ≈ 0.4966 * 0.92868.

Compute 0.4966 * 0.9 = 0.44694, 0.4966 * 0.02868 ≈ ~0.0142. So total ≈ 0.46114.

Hmm, so e^-0.77 ≈ 0.461. But I'm not sure if that's exact. But perhaps I can get a better estimate.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute e^-0.77132 using a calculator-like approach.

Wait, I'll think about the exact value.

Let me use a calculator (pretend to compute it).

Alternatively, perhaps since this is getting complicated, I can proceed with the values I have.

So, S(50) is e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283).

What's e^-0.19283? Approximately 0.824.

Because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187. So, 0.19283 is a bit less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

So, S(50) = 0.825.

Now, the probability that the atom has decayed between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, or 36.3% chance.

But wait, the options given are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So 36% isn't an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got confused with the probabilities. Let me think again.

The question is: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 0.32.

So, the survival probability S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

So, S(t) = e^(-λ t) = 0.68 when t=100. So, λ = ln(1/0.68)/100.

Wait, because S(t) = e^(-λ t) ⇒ ln(S(t)) = -λ t ⇒ λ = -ln(S(t))/t.

So, S(100)=0.68 ⇒ λ= ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.4706)/100.

What's ln(1.4706)? I know ln(1.4) ≈ 0.3365, ln(1.4706) is a bit higher. Let me compute more accurately.

Using e^0.38566 = 1.4706? Because earlier I had ln(0.68)=-0.38566. So, yes. So, ln(1.4706)=0.38566.

So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, that's correct.

Now, the problem is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

So, the time elapsed is 50 minutes, the next interval is 150 minutes.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P( decay between 50 and 200 ) = S(50) - S(200).

Compute S(50):

S(50)=e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ ?

We can compute e^-0.19283.

I know that ln(2)=0.6931, e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187.

0.19283 is 0.00717 less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 = e^(0.2 - 0.00717) = e^0.2 * e^-0.00717 ≈ 1.2214 * 0.99293 ≈ 1.2214 * 0.99293.

Compute 1.2214 * 0.99 = 1.2101, and 1.2214 * 0.00293 ≈ 0.00358. So total ≈ 1.2137. Wait, no, wait: e^-0.2 is 0.8187, so e^-0.19283 is larger than that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.19283 in terms of ln.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.2.

Let me write x = 0.19283 = 0.2 - 0.00717.

e^-x = e^{-(0.2 - 0.00717)} = e^-0.2 * e^0.00717 ≈ 0.8187 * (1 + 0.00717 + (0.00717)^2/2) )

Compute 0.8187 * 1.00717 ≈ 0.8187 * 1.00717.

Compute 0.8187 * 1 = 0.8187.

0.8187 * 0.00717 ≈ approx 0.8187 * 0.007 ≈ 0.00573.

So, 0.8187 + 0.00573 ≈ 0.8244.

So, e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.8244.

So, S(50)=0.8244.

Now, compute S(200)=e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^-0.77132.

We need to compute e^-0.77132.

Hmm. Let's compute this value accurately.

We know that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77132 is a bit lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but let's try to approximate.

Alternatively, let me think ln(0.463) ≈ -0.771. So, e^-0.77132 ≈ 0.462.

So, S(200)=0.462.

Therefore, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = 0.8244 - 0.462 = 0.3624, approximately 36.24%. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute. Another approach: The decay probability in a time interval is given by 1 - e^(-λ t), where t is the time. But in this case, the initial 100 minutes is t=100, P=32% decay.

Wait, maybe I should model the decay as a half-life or something else. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for conditional probability.

After t=50, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P = (1 - S(50 + 150)) / S(50).

Wait, that's not right. No, the correct formula is P = S(50) - S(200).

Because S(50) is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, and S(200) is the probability it hasn't decayed by 200. So the difference is the probability it decayed between 50 and 200.

So, 0.8244 - 0.462 = 0.3624, which is 36.24%.

But the answer options are 44, 40, 52, 48. So none of them match. Hmm, that suggests I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I got the time intervals wrong. Let me recheck the question.

The question says: after 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So, 50 to 200 minutes.

But the initial data is that within 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay constant λ using t=100, S=0.68.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the decay constant and then find the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the decay as a uniform probability. Wait, no. Radioactive decay is exponential.

Wait, another thought: Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from now. So, perhaps the conditional probability is (1 - S(150)) / (1 - S(50))?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, event A is decay between 50 and 200, and event B is not decaying until 50.

So, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A and B) is same as P(A), because B is the condition that it hasn't decayed by 50, so A is the event that it decays between 50 and 200. So, P(A|B) = P(A and B) = P(A) given B.

Wait, perhaps another way to think: The decay process is memoryless, so the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, regardless of how much time has passed before, is 1 - e^(-λ T).

But that can't be right because the survival probability is e^(-λ t), so the probability of decay in the next T minutes, regardless of prior time, would be 1 - e^(-λ T).

Wait, but that's only true if you're considering a time T starting from the current time, irrespective of how long it's been since it was created. So, perhaps the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay is independent of the past. So, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150), regardless of what happened before. But wait, that can't be right because the 150 minutes are in the future. Or is that the case?

No, no, because the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed up to now, is the same as the probability it decays in the first t minutes. So, yes, it's 1 - e^(-λ t).

So, in this case, t is 150 minutes.

So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, I have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, λ *150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488.

0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's compute more precisely.

Approximate e^-0.57849.

Let me compute it as:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that ln(0.55) ≈ ?

Compute ln(0.55): ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.55) is about -0.5978. So, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5609?

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561.

So, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9% approximately. So, about 44% chance.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

So, the answer would be 44%, option A.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the probability as 36%, it didn't match. But perhaps the correct approach is this memoryless method, which gives 44%. So, which is correct?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach by considering the time from 50 to 200, but perhaps the correct approach is to use the memoryless property and compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Because according to the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of the previous time.

So, the answer is approximately 44%, option A.

So, I think the correct answer is A) 44%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The survival probability of an atom at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The decay probability within a time interval is \( 1 - S(t) \).

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, meaning the survival probability after 100 minutes is:

\[
S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using the survival formula:

\[
S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \implies \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} = 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes). The probability of decay in this interval is:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Approximating \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561 \), we find:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \approx 44\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.

**Answer: A**

Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, was that the case? Or does the probability accumulate over time?

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, for an atom, there's a 32% chance it will decay in the first 100 minutes after it's created. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, so the first 100 minutes is the initial period. But the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. So the remaining time we're considering is the next 150 minutes, which is 50 to 200 minutes total.

I think radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay probability is modeled by the formula N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Oh right, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by that formula. So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 minus that.

But wait, the question gives a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. That means 32% chance to decay by 100 minutes. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (100% - 32%).

So, the survival probability S(t) is 68% at t=100 minutes. S(t) = e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

I can solve for λ. Taking natural logs on both sides, ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = -(ln 0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is e^-0.415 approximately? Wait, I remember that ln(0.6931) is about -0.366, which is for half-life. Hmm. Maybe I should just approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the decay constant λ. Because the problem is about a specific atom, which either decays or doesn't. So it's about conditional probability. Given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but considering the decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in a certain time interval is independent of previous events. Oh wait, no, because each decay is an independent event. So, the survival probability up to time t is S(t) = e^(-λt). So, the probability the atom hasn't decayed by time t is S(t).

So, the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So, the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (which is 150 minutes after 50) is equal to the probability it hasn't decayed at 50 minus the probability it hasn't decayed at 200. So, S(50) - S(200) would give the probability of decay between 50 and 200.

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in any interval is only dependent on the time passed, not the past. So, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays from time 50 to 200. Which is 1 - S(200).

But we have to find S(50) and S(200) using the given information.

We know that at t=100, S(100)=0.68. So, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

We can find λ as λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

So, let's compute λ. Let me think, ln(0.68) ≈ ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ approximately, using the approximation ln(1-x) ≈ -x - x²/2 for small x. But 0.32 is not that small. Alternatively, I can compute ln(0.68) numerically. I think ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3) is about 1.098, so ln(0.68) is negative.

Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, I need to find the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 minutes, which is 50 + 150 minutes. So, S(200) = e^(-λ *200).

Plugging in λ, e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132).

What's e^-0.77132? Let me approximate. e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.77 is around 0.462, perhaps. Alternatively, 0.77132 is approximately 0.77. So, e^-0.77 ≈ 0.462.

So, S(200) ≈ 0.462.

But wait, I need to compute it more accurately perhaps. Let me think:

We have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, time t=200 minutes: λt = 0.0038566 * 200 = 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.8 ≈ 0.4493. So, 0.77132 is between 0.7 and 0.8. Let me calculate the exact value.

Let me compute it as:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around a=0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that 0.77132 = 0.7 + 0.07132.

So, e^-0.7 = approximately 0.4966.

The derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. So, the linear approximation around x=0.7 is:

e^-(0.7 + δ) ≈ e^-0.7 (1 - δ) for small δ. Hmm, but δ is 0.07132, which is about 10% of 0.7, so the approximation might not be super accurate, but let's try.

e^-0.77 ≈ 0.4966 * (1 - 0.07132) = 0.4966 * 0.92868 ≈ 0.4966 * 0.92868.

Compute 0.4966 * 0.9 = 0.44694, 0.4966 * 0.02868 ≈ ~0.0142. So total ≈ 0.46114.

Hmm, so e^-0.77 ≈ 0.461. But I'm not sure if that's exact. But perhaps I can get a better estimate.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute e^-0.77132 using a calculator-like approach.

Wait, I'll think about the exact value.

Let me use a calculator (pretend to compute it).

Alternatively, perhaps since this is getting complicated, I can proceed with the values I have.

So, S(50) is e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283).

What's e^-0.19283? Approximately 0.824.

Because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187. So, 0.19283 is a bit less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.825.

So, S(50) = 0.825.

Now, the probability that the atom has decayed between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, or 36.3% chance.

But wait, the options given are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So 36% isn't an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got confused with the probabilities. Let me think again.

The question is: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 0.32.

So, the survival probability S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

So, S(t) = e^(-λ t) = 0.68 when t=100. So, λ = ln(1/0.68)/100.

Wait, because S(t) = e^(-λ t) ⇒ ln(S(t)) = -λ t ⇒ λ = -ln(S(t))/t.

So, S(100)=0.68 ⇒ λ= ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.4706)/100.

What's ln(1.4706)? I know ln(1.4) ≈ 0.3365, ln(1.4706) is a bit higher. Let me compute more accurately.

Using e^0.38566 = 1.4706? Because earlier I had ln(0.68)=-0.38566. So, yes. So, ln(1.4706)=0.38566.

So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, that's correct.

Now, the problem is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

So, the time elapsed is 50 minutes, the next interval is 150 minutes.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P( decay between 50 and 200 ) = S(50) - S(200).

Compute S(50):

S(50)=e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ ?

We can compute e^-0.19283.

I know that ln(2)=0.6931, e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187.

0.19283 is 0.00717 less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 = e^(0.2 - 0.00717) = e^0.2 * e^-0.00717 ≈ 1.2214 * 0.99293 ≈ 1.2214 * 0.99293.

Compute 1.2214 * 0.99 = 1.2101, and 1.2214 * 0.00293 ≈ 0.00358. So total ≈ 1.2137. Wait, no, wait: e^-0.2 is 0.8187, so e^-0.19283 is larger than that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.19283 in terms of ln.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.2.

Let me write x = 0.19283 = 0.2 - 0.00717.

e^-x = e^{-(0.2 - 0.00717)} = e^-0.2 * e^0.00717 ≈ 0.8187 * (1 + 0.00717 + (0.00717)^2/2) )

Compute 0.8187 * 1.00717 ≈ 0.8187 * 1.00717.

Compute 0.8187 * 1 = 0.8187.

0.8187 * 0.00717 ≈ approx 0.8187 * 0.007 ≈ 0.00573.

So, 0.8187 + 0.00573 ≈ 0.8244.

So, e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.8244.

So, S(50)=0.8244.

Now, compute S(200)=e^(-λ *200) = e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^-0.77132.

We need to compute e^-0.77132.

Hmm. Let's compute this value accurately.

We know that e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966, e^-0.77132 is a bit lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but let's try to approximate.

Alternatively, let me think ln(0.463) ≈ -0.771. So, e^-0.77132 ≈ 0.462.

So, S(200)=0.462.

Therefore, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = 0.8244 - 0.462 = 0.3624, approximately 36.24%. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute. Another approach: The decay probability in a time interval is given by 1 - e^(-λ t), where t is the time. But in this case, the initial 100 minutes is t=100, P=32% decay.

Wait, maybe I should model the decay as a half-life or something else. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for conditional probability.

After t=50, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P = (1 - S(50 + 150)) / S(50).

Wait, that's not right. No, the correct formula is P = S(50) - S(200).

Because S(50) is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, and S(200) is the probability it hasn't decayed by 200. So the difference is the probability it decayed between 50 and 200.

So, 0.8244 - 0.462 = 0.3624, which is 36.24%.

But the answer options are 44, 40, 52, 48. So none of them match. Hmm, that suggests I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I got the time intervals wrong. Let me recheck the question.

The question says: after 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So, 50 to 200 minutes.

But the initial data is that within 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay constant λ using t=100, S=0.68.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the decay constant and then find the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the decay as a uniform probability. Wait, no. Radioactive decay is exponential.

Wait, another thought: Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from now. So, perhaps the conditional probability is (1 - S(150)) / (1 - S(50))?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, event A is decay between 50 and 200, and event B is not decaying until 50.

So, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A and B) is same as P(A), because B is the condition that it hasn't decayed by 50, so A is the event that it decays between 50 and 200. So, P(A|B) = P(A and B) = P(A) given B.

Wait, perhaps another way to think: The decay process is memoryless, so the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, regardless of how much time has passed before, is 1 - e^(-λ T).

But that can't be right because the survival probability is e^(-λ t), so the probability of decay in the next T minutes, regardless of prior time, would be 1 - e^(-λ T).

Wait, but that's only true if you're considering a time T starting from the current time, irrespective of how long it's been since it was created. So, perhaps the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay is independent of the past. So, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150), regardless of what happened before. But wait, that can't be right because the 150 minutes are in the future. Or is that the case?

No, no, because the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed up to now, is the same as the probability it decays in the first t minutes. So, yes, it's 1 - e^(-λ t).

So, in this case, t is 150 minutes.

So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, I have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, λ *150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488.

0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's compute more precisely.

Approximate e^-0.57849.

Let me compute it as:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that ln(0.55) ≈ ?

Compute ln(0.55): ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.55) is about -0.5978. So, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5609?

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561.

So, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9% approximately. So, about 44% chance.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

So, the answer would be 44%, option A.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the probability as 36%, it didn't match. But perhaps the correct approach is this memoryless method, which gives 44%. So, which is correct?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach by considering the time from 50 to 200, but perhaps the correct approach is to use the memoryless property and compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Because according to the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of the previous time.

So, the answer is approximately 44%, option A.

So, I think the correct answer is A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The survival probability of an atom at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The decay probability within a time interval is \( 1 - S(t) \).

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, meaning the survival probability after 100 minutes is:

\[
S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using the survival formula:

\[
S(100) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \implies \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} = 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes). The probability of decay in this interval is:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Approximating \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561 \), we find:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \approx 44\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
