Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, I think using Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because Wien's Law is lambda_max = constant / T. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity—I remember that's the speed at which a star is moving towards or away from us. But wait, since Star_1 has zero radial velocity, it's not moving relative to us along the line of sight. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. How does that affect things?

The question is about luminosity. The astronomers assumed they radiate as black bodies. So I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since we're considering them as black bodies, that should apply.

But wait, luminosity also depends on the star's distance. Because if a star is moving, especially if it's moving away, its light is redshifted. Oh! Because of the Doppler effect. So the observed luminosity would be affected by any redshift due to their velocities.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity. So are they calculating the intrinsic luminosity (L) or the observed luminosity (which would be affected by distance and redshift)? Hmm. The question says they computed the luminosity, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So I think they are considering the intrinsic luminosity, which depends on R and T. But wait, because of the Doppler shift, the observed temperature might be affected because the wavelength is shifted. Because if a star is moving away, the wavelengths are stretched (redshifted), which would mean the observed temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which implies that after considering Doppler shift, their temperatures are the same. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So from our perspective, their peak emission is at the same wavelength. But because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. So its actual (intrinsic) temperature must be higher. Because when it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the observed T is lower. But since the observed lambda_max is the same for both, that means to have the same observed wavelength, Star_2's intrinsic temperature must be higher. Because a higher T would emit at a shorter wavelength, but when redshifted, it ends up at the same observed lambda as Star_1, which is stationary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model it.

Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approx 2.898×10^-3 m·K).

For Star_1: It's at rest, so observed lambda_max = lambda1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: It's moving away at velocity v. The observed wavelength would be longer due to redshift. The Doppler formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). But when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit * (1 + v/c). Because v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333… So it's a small v/c, so using the approximation should be okay.

So for Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But according to the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So:

lambda1 = lambda2 * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda1 is b / T1, and lambda2 is b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / (1) ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, no, solving for T2.

Wait, let's do the algebra.

From 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But wait, isn't that the opposite? Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so its emitted wavelength must be shorter. Which would mean a higher temperature. So T2 > T1.

Wait, let me check again.

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c )

If v is positive (moving away), lambda_obs is longer than lambda_emit.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 / (1 + v2/c )

But since lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda1,

lambda_emit2 = lambda1 / (1 + v2/c ) = (b / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_emit2 is also equal to b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

Simplify:

1 / T2 = (1 / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 and T1,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Which leads to:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So yes, T2 is higher than T1.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Now, I can compute (1 + v2/c ). v2 is 700 km/s.

Wait, let me compute v2/c.

v2 = 700,000 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 = approx 0.023333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.023333...

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.023333.

So, T2 is about 2.33% higher than T1.

Now, move on to calculate their luminosities.

Luminosity of a star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

The question states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's radius. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait no, wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2? Let me recheck the question.

Question says: "Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2." So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

So, R1² = (1.5 R2)² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1 = 4 π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4

L2 = 4 π R2² σ T2^4

So the ratio L1 / L2 = (2.25 R2² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which simplifies to 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4.

We know T2 is T1 * 1.023333 approximately, so T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^4.

Compute step by step:

0.977^2 = approx 0.977 * 0.977. Let me compute:

0.977 * 0.977:
= (1 - 0.023)²
= 1 - 2*(0.023) + (0.023)^2
≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529
≈ 0.954529.

So 0.977^2 ≈ 0.955.

Then, 0.955^2 ≈ (0.955)^2 = 0.912025.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.912.

So,

L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.25 * 0.912.

Compute 2.25 * 0.912:

2 * 0.912 =1.824.

0.25 *0.912= 0.228.

So total is 1.824 + 0.228 = 2.052.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. But the options are around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the approximation is too rough.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

First, let me compute (1 + v/c) exactly.

v = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3 * 10^8 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.023333333.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023333333 = approx 0.97707.

Wait, let me compute 1.023333333^−1.

Compute 1 / 1.023333333.

Well, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x^3 for small x.

x = 0.0233333.

So 1/(1.023333333) ≈ 1 - 0.0233333 + (0.0233333)^2 - (0.0233333)^3.

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: -0.0233333 → 0.9766667.

Third term: (0.0233333)^2 = approx 0.0005444 → 0.9766667 + 0.0005444 ≈ 0.977211.

Fourth term: -(0.0233333)^3 ≈ -(0.00001268) → 0.977211 - 0.00001268 ≈ 0.977198.

So approx 0.977198.

So, T1/T2 ≈ 0.977198.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977198)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.977198 squared:

Compute 0.977198 * 0.977198.

Let me compute:

Let me write 0.977198 as approximately 0.9772.

0.9772 * 0.9772.

= (0.97 + 0.0072)²

= 0.97² + 2*0.97*0.0072 + (0.0072)^2

= 0.9409 + 2*(0.006984) + 0.00005184

= 0.9409 + 0.013968 + 0.00005184

≈ 0.9409 + 0.013968 = 0.954868 + 0.00005184 ≈ 0.95491984.

So 0.9772 squared is about 0.95492.

Now, square that again to get (0.9772)^4.

0.95492 squared:

= (0.95 + 0.00492)^2

= 0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.00492) + (0.00492)^2

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.95*0.00492) + 0.0000242

Compute 0.95 * 0.00492 = 0.004674. Multiply by 2 → 0.009348.

So 0.9025 + 0.009348 = 0.911848 + 0.0000242 ≈ 0.911872.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.911872.

Now, putting it all together.

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911872.

2.25 * 0.911872.

Compute 2 * 0.911872 = 1.823744.

0.25 * 0.911872 = 0.227968.

Add them together: 1.823744 + 0.227968 = 2.051712.

So approximately 2.0517.

But the options are:

A) ~2.25,

B) ~2.32,

C) ~2.35,

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none of these are near 2.05. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Doppler shift effect on the temperature. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observed temperature is T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait no, the Doppler effect for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit ( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )^{1/2} }, but when v << c, it's approximately 1 + beta, but maybe I should use the exact formula.

Wait, let me clarify.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Where beta = v/c.

Wait, no. Let me get the correct formula.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula for light is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) )

But this is when the source is moving away (v is positive). So I think I should use this exact formula, not the approximation.

So, for Star_2, moving away with v=700 km/s, beta = v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But in the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, since the peak wavelengths are the same.

So,

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But,

lambda1_emit = b / T1,

lambda2_emit = b / T2,

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So let's compute sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) with beta=0.023333.

Compute numerator: 1 + beta = 1.0233333

Denominator: 1 - beta = 0.9766667.

So (1.0233333 / 0.9766667 ) ≈ (1.0233333)/(0.9766667) ≈ 1.047619.

So sqrt(1.047619) ≈ 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023518.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023518 ≈ 0.9767.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.9767)^4.

Compute 0.9767^4.

First, compute 0.9767 squared.

0.9767 * 0.9767.

Let me compute:

0.9767 * 0.9767 ≈ (approx 0.976^2)

0.976^2 = (1 - 0.024)^2 = 1 - 0.048 + 0.000576 = 0.952576.

Wait, but 0.9767^2.

Compute 0.9767 * 0.9767:

Breakdown:

= (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.0067) * (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.0067)

But perhaps a better way is to compute 9767 * 9767 and then adjust the decimal.

Alternatively, use the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Let a = 0.97, b = 0.0067.

So,

(0.97 + 0.0067)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2*(0.97)(0.0067) + (0.0067)^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2*0.97 *0.0067 = 2 * 0.006509 = 0.013018.

(0.0067)^2 = 0.00004489.

So sum is 0.9409 + 0.013018 = 0.953918 + 0.00004489 ≈ 0.953963.

So, 0.9767^2 ≈ 0.95396.

Now, square that to get (0.9767)^4.

0.95396 squared.

Again,

= (0.95 + 0.00396)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.00396) + (0.00396)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00396 = 2 * 0.003762 → 0.007524.

(0.00396)^2 ≈ 0.00001568.

So sum is 0.9025 + 0.007524 = 0.910024 + 0.00001568 ≈ 0.91003968.

So, (0.9767)^4 ≈ 0.91004.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91004 ≈ 2.0526.

Wait, same result as before. So that gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is D) ~2.23, but that’s higher. I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So the ratio is L1/L2.

Wait, but what if the mass comes into play? Because the problem says both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't a factor. So why was the mass given?

Wait, perhaps I missed something else. Let me go back to the problem.

The problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the calculation is about the ratio of their luminosities.

Wait, but I think I may have messed up the ratio.

Wait, L1 is based on R1 and T1, and L2 on R2 and T2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

so R1² = 2.25 R2².

But T1 and T2 are related through the Doppler shift as earlier.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4 = 4π R2² σ (2.25 T1^4 )

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1 = 2.25 * ( T1^4 / T2^4 ) * L2.

Wait no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the ratio.

Wait, L1 = 4 π R1² σ T1^4 =4 π (1.5 R2 )² σ T1^4 = 4 π R2² σ ( (1.5)^2 T1^4 ) = 4 π R2² σ (2.25 T1^4 )

L2 = 4 π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (2.25 T1^4 ) / T2^4 = 2.25 (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Earlier, I thought (T1/T2) = 0.977, so (T1/T2)^4 = 0.91, leading to 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

But according to the problem, the factor is higher than that, around 2.23.

So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity, not just the temperature.

Wait, because when a star is moving away, the observed flux is lower because of the redshift. Because the photons are less energetic and less frequent. So, the observed flux F is L / (4π d²) (1 + z)^{-1}, where z is the redshift.

Wait, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed as if they are black bodies, but perhaps the actual observed luminosity is being considered, which would involve the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in the rest frame of the star.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that Star_2 is moving away, so its observed flux is lower. But the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps their approach is to calculate the intrinsic luminosity, but when considering the Doppler shift, the observed temperature is lower, which affects the calculation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try an alternative approach.

Let me recap:

- Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, lambda_obs.

- Star_1 is at rest, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit1 = b / T1.

- Star_2 is moving away at v, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c) ≈ lambda_emit2 (1 + beta), where beta = v/c.

But lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs1 / (1 + beta) ) = (b / T1) / (1 + beta)

But lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + beta)

=> T2 = T1 (1 + beta )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + beta ), with beta = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977 * T2.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought T2 was larger than T1. Because T2 = T1 * (1 + beta ), so T2 is higher.

So, T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + beta )) ≈ 0.977 T2.

Wait, but that would mean T1 is lower than T2, which makes sense because Star_2's light is redshifted, making its observed emission peak at the same lambda as Star_1. So Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength (higher T) to appear at a longer observed wavelength.

So, now, with T2 higher than T1, but R1 is 1.5 R2.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2,

(R1²)/(R2²) = (2.25) 

And,

T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + beta )) → so T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

Thus, (T1 / T2 ) = 1/1.023333 ≈ 0.97707.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (0.97707)^4 ≈ 0.9100.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9100 ≈ 2.051.

Again, same as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.05. The closest option is D) ~2.23, which is higher than 2.05.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe I should use exact values without approximations.

Let me compute (1 + beta) exactly.

Beta = 700,000 / (3e8) = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.02333333333.

So,

1 + beta = 1.0233333333.

sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1.0233333333) / (0.9766666667) )

Compute (1.0233333333)/(0.9766666667) = 1.0476190476.

The square root of 1.0476190476 is:

√1.0476190476 ≈ 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023518.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1/1.023518 ≈ 0.9767.

(T1/T2 )^4 ≈ (0.9767)^4.

Compute 0.9767^2 = ?

Using exact calculation:

0.9767 × 0.9767:

= (0.97 × 0.97 ) + (0.97 × 0.0067 × 2 ) + (0.0067 × 0.0067 )

= 0.9409 + (0.006509 × 2 ) + 0.00004489

= 0.9409 + 0.013018 + 0.00004489 = 0.95396289.

Now, square that:

(0.95396289)^2.

= (0.95 + 0.00396289)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95 * 0.00396289) + (0.00396289)^2.

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.00376475) + 0.000015708.

= 0.9025 + 0.0075295 + 0.000015708 ≈ 0.9100452.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.910045.

Then,

L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 0.910045 ≈ 2.0526.

Which is approximately 2.053.

But the given options are all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler effect. Maybe I should calculate how the flux is affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, the flux observed from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

Because when a star is moving away, the flux is dimmed due to the redshift. But the problem says that the stars' luminosities were computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps their actual intrinsic luminosity is being considered, not the observed flux.

Wait, but the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the luminosity is as observed from Earth, considering the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the observed flux to compute luminosity, which would involve the redshift.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think.

Wait, the luminosity as seen from Earth would be L_obs = L_intrinsic * (1 + z)^{-1}.

Because when a star is moving away, each photon's energy is reduced by (1 + z), and the number of photons per second is also reduced by (1 + z) due to time dilation. So the flux is F = L_intrinsic / [4 pi d^2 (1 + z) ]

But the problem states that the stars' luminosities were computed as black bodies, so perhaps I should be computing their intrinsic luminosities based on their emitted wavelengths, which are affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's model each star's emitted spectrum.

Star_1 is at rest, so its emission is at T1, and its luminosity is L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

Star_2 is moving away at v, so its emitted spectrum is at T2, but we observe it as having a temperature T2_obs = T2 / (1 + v/c ), due to the redshift. But wait, no, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So,

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

Which implies,

lambda_emit_1 * (1 + v_1/c ) = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_2/c )

But Star_1 has v1 = 0, so,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 )

So,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 0.0233333 )

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1.0233333 )

=> T2 = T1 * 1.0233333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0233333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.0233333 ≈ 0.977 T2.

Wait, now R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4 = 4 pi ( (1.5 R2 )^2 ) sigma ( (T2 / 1.0233333 )^4 )

= 4 pi R2^2 sigma ( (2.25) ) ( T2^4 / (1.0233333)^4 )

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 = L2 * (2.25) / (1.0233333)^4.

Compute (1.0233333)^4:

As before, 1.0233333^4 ≈ 1.0233333^2 squared.

1.0233333^2 ≈ 1.047619.

Then, 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

L1 = L2 * (2.25) / 1.09735 ≈ L2 * 2.25 / 1.09735.

Compute 2.25 / 1.09735.

2.25 ÷ 1.09735 ≈ Let me compute:

1.09735 * 2 = 2.1947.

Which is just under 2.25. 2.1947 + 0.0553 = 2.25.

So 1.09735 * 2.05 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, more accurately.

Let me compute 1.09735 * 2.05.

= 1.09735 * 2 = 2.1947.

1.09735 * 0.05 = 0.0548675.

Total ≈ 2.1947 + 0.0548675 = 2.2495675.

So, 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm trying to find x where 1.09735 * x = 2.25.

So x = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, so,

L1 / L2 = 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, why don't the options match this?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which star is hotter. Let me re-express.

Wait, I have L1 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) * L2.

But since T2 = 1.023333 T1,

T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (1/1.023333 )^4.

Which is (approx 0.9767 )^4 ≈ 0.91.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed luminosity.

The observed flux from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) (1 + z)^{-1}.

But the problem states that the luminosities were computed, so perhaps the observed flux is F = L / (4 pi d^2) (1 + v/c ), assuming v << c and using the approximation (1 + z) ≈ 1 + v/c.

Wait, no, for recessional velocity, (1 + z) = 1 + v/c, so flux F = L / [4 pi d^2 (1 + v/c ) ].

But the problem says they computed the luminosity as black bodies, so perhaps they used the observed flux and calculated the luminosity based on that.

Wait, but if the observed flux is F_obs = F_emit / (1 + v/c ), then the observed luminosity (from Earth) would be L_obs = 4 pi d^2 F_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ).

So, L_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ).

But then, the intrinsic luminosity is higher. But the problem says the luminosity computed is based on the black body assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the observed luminosity, which would be lower due to the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the question is about the computed luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed luminosity is lower. So the computed L (from observed data) would be L1 (computed) = L1_intrinsic, and L2_computed = L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c ).

So, the ratio (L1_computed / L2_computed) = [ L1_intrinsic ] / [ L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c ) ] = (L1/L2) * (1 + v2/c )

But earlier, we have L1/L2 = 2.05.

So,

(L1_computed/L2_computed) = 2.05 * (1 + 0.0233333) ≈ 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.10.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the luminosity is computed using the observed parameters, so including the Doppler effect.

Wait, perhaps the method is:

Compute L using the observed flux, which would be F_observed = F_intrinsic / (1 + z).

But the astronomers are computing the intrinsic luminosity, which would be L_intrinsic = F_obs * 4 pi d^2 * (1 + z).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same when observed. So the observed temperatures are the same.

Wait, but that's not the case. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature than Star_1. But the problem states they have the same observed wavelength, so they must have different intrinsic temperatures.

So, as established, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ) = 1.02333 T1.

So, perhaps I should compute the luminosity according to their intrinsic parameters, which are R1 =1.5 R2, T1, T2 = 1.02333 T1.

So,

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (1.023333 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.023333)^4 )

Compute 1.023333^4:

As before, 1.023333^2 ≈ 1.047619,

Then, 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the observed luminosity, which would be L_observed = L_intrinsic * (1 + z)^{-1}.

So,

L1_observed = L1_intrinsic,

L2_observed = L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c )

So,

L1_obs / L2_obs = (L1 / L2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

= 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.05 * 1.023 ≈ 2.10.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the luminosity is calculated using the observed wavelengths and temperatures, which are the same.

Wait, but the observed temperature would be lower for Star_2.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed lambda_max is the same, but their intrinsic lambda_max are different.

So, using observed lambda_max, the temperatures are computed as T_obs = b / lambda_max.

Since lambda_max is same, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But the intrinsic temperatures are T1 and T2 = T_obs1 * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Let me outline the data:

- Star_1: R1 = 1.5 R2, v1 = 0 km/s.

- Star_2: R2, v2 = 700 km/s.

- Both have same observed lambda_max.

Assume they are black bodies.

Compute L1 / L2.

Approach:

1. Find the relation between T1 and T2 using the observed lambda_max.

2. Express L1 and L2 in terms of R1, R2, T1, T2.

3. Compute the ratio.

From step 1:

lambda_obs = b / T_obs.

But for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c ) → so:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v/c )

But lambda_emit_2 = b / T2.

Thus,

lambda_obs = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

But lambda_obs for Star_1 is b / T1.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c ) / T2 → T2 = T1 (1 + v/c ).

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Step 2:

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

Ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (T1 * 1.023333 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.023333 )^4 )

Compute (1.023333 )^4:

As before, approx 1.09735.

So,

2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

So, same result again.

But none of the options match. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 using exact steps.

Compute 1.023333 squared:

1.023333 × 1.023333.

Do this multiplication step by step.

1.023333 × 1.023333:

Compute 1 × 1.023333 = 1.023333.

Compute 0.02 × 1.023333 = 0.02046666.

Compute 0.003333 × 1.023333 ≈ 0.0034111.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute (1 + 0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.023333 + (0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.00054444.

= 1.047210.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.047619. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.023333 squared is 0.023333 * 0.023333 = approximately 0.0005444.

So,

(1.023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.023333 + 0.0005444 = 1 + 0.046666 + 0.0005444 = 1.0472104.

Then, (1.0472104)^2.

= (1.0472104)^2.

Compute this as:

= (1 + 0.0472104 )^2 = 1 + 2*0.0472104 + (0.0472104)^2.

= 1 + 0.0944208 + 0.0022291.

= 1 + 0.0944208 = 1.0944208 + 0.0022291 = 1.09665.

So,

(1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.25 ÷ 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, the given options are all higher than this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed flux, including both the dimming and the shift in wavelength.

The flux observed from a star is given by:

F_obs = (L_emit) / (4 pi d^2) ) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

But since we don't know the distance, perhaps the problem assumes the same distance for both stars, which is not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed flux is used to compute the luminosity, including the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem says the luminosity is computed as if they are black bodies. So perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the observed parameters, which would mean that the observed temperature is used.

Wait, but if we calculate luminosity using the observed temperature, then:

L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_obs^4.

But R is the intrinsic radius, not the observed radius.

Wait, but if we don't know the distance, we can't get R from observed data. So perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed peak wavelength to calculate the temperature, and then compute the luminosity based on the intrinsic radius and observed temperature.

Wait, but that would not make sense, because the observed temperature is lower due to Doppler shift, leading to lower luminosity.

Wait, let's think.

If the stars have the same observed lambda_max, then their observed temperatures are the same, T_obs.

But their intrinsic temperatures are different.

So,

For Star_1 (v1=0), T_obs1 = T1.

For Star_2 (v2=700 km/s), T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

But since T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Now, luminosity for each star is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_intrinsic^4.

So,

L1 =4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma T_obs^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So, compute L1/L2.

= [ (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma T_obs^4 ] / [ R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4 ]

= (2.25 R2^2 ) / R2^2 * T_obs^4 / (1.023333^4 T_obs^4 )

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 )

As before, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, I'm repeatedly getting 2.05, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should include the Doppler effect in the calculation of the observed luminosity. The observed luminosity would be L_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ), because of the redshift.

So,

L1_obs = L1_emit.

L2_obs = L2_emit / (1 + v2/c )

So,

L1_obs / L2_obs = (L1 / L2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

= 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.10.

Still doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed radius, but that doesn't make sense as radius isn't observed directly but via other means like angular size or surface gravity.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed radius is affected by Doppler shift. But no, the radius is determined from other methods, like the star's spectral lines' broadening, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I've mixed up the observed and intrinsic temperatures, leading to the wrong ratio.

Wait, let me try using the observed temperatures.

Since observed lambda_max is the same, T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs.

So,

For Star_1:

T_obs = T1.

For Star_2:

T_obs = T2 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

Similarly,

Star_1's T1 = T_obs.

So,

L1 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma (T_obs )^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So, L1/L2 = [ (2.25 R2^2) * T_obs^4 ] / [ R2^2 * (1.023333 T_obs )^4 ]

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 )

As before, 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

I think I'm stuck. The calculation consistently leads to L1/L2 ~2.05, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosities are computed assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the observed flux is being used to compute the luminosity, which would involve the Doppler shift.

The flux F from a star is F = L / (4 pi d²) (1 + z)^{-1}.

But if the distance d is the same for both stars, then the observed flux F is proportional to L (1 + z)^{-1}.

But the problem doesn't state that the stars are at the same distance. So perhaps distance is not a factor here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the Doppler shift in terms of the observed flux, but without knowing the distance, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the peak wavelength and the Doppler shift to calculate the intrinsic temperature, and then using that to compute the luminosity.

Wait, given that, the observed peak wavelength is the same, so T_obs is the same.

But for Star_2, T_intrinsic = T_obs * (1 + v/c ).

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Thus, L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2 )² sigma (T_obs )^4.

L2 =4 pi R2² sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So,

L1/L2= (2.25 R2² T_obs^4 ) / ( R2² (1.023333^4 T_obs^4 ) )

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result again.

I'm not seeing a way to get to the options given. The only possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 accurately.

1.023333^2 = 1.023333 * 1.023333.

Compute:

1.023333 × 1.023333:

= (1 + 0.023333) × (1 + 0.023333 )

= 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.00054444

= 1.04721044.

Now, 1.04721044 squared:

= (1.04721044)^2.

Compute this as:

= (1 + 0.04721044 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04721044 ) + (0.04721044 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09442088 + 0.00222917.

= 1 + 0.09442088 = 1.09442088 + 0.00222917 ≈ 1.09665005.

So,

(1.023333)^4 = 1.09665.

Thus, 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm. So I think I'm confident in this result, but the options don't have 2.05. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the radius measurement. But I don't think so, because the radius is determined through other means, not the observed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic Doppler shift without the approximation. Let me try that.

The exact Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Where beta = v/c = 0.023333.

So,

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1.023333)/(0.976667) ) ≈ sqrt(1.047619) ≈ 1.023518.

So,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / 1.023518.

For Star_2,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / 1.023518.

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = b / (lambda_obs / 1.023518 ) = (b / lambda_obs ) * 1.023518 = T_obs * 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023518.

So,

T1 = T_obs.

Thus,

L1 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma (T_obs )^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023518 T_obs )^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2^2 T_obs^4 ) / ( R2^2 (1.023518^4 T_obs^4 ) )

= 2.25 / (1.023518^4 )

Compute 1.023518^4.

Compute 1.023518 squared: 1.023518 × 1.023518.

= approx 1.047619.

Then, square that: 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

1.023518^4 ≈ 1.09735.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Same result again.

So, I think my calculations are correct, but the options don't match. It's possible that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2 )^4.

With R1 =1.5 R2 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

Wait, no, earlier analysis showed T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So,

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c ).

So,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c ).

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T = b / lambda_emit = (b (1 + v/c )) ) / lambda_obs.

So,

T = T_obs * (1 + v/c ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Thus,

(T1/T2 )^4 = (1 / 1.023333 )^4 ≈ (0.9767 )^4 ≈ 0.91.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

So, again, same result.

Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach that I'm not seeing.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed radius, but that doesn't make sense because the radius is determined via other methods, not via wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Doppler shift to adjust the radius as well, but that's not a standard approach.

Wait, another approach: Considering that the observed flux is the same for both stars, but that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed luminosity, which would be lower for Star_2.

But the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the answer is 2.05, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says:

"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

Which implies that T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Thus, T_obs = lambda_max = b / T.

So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Which leads to T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

Wait, earlier I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.

Wait, the Doppler formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * ( sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

But for small beta, lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + beta ).

Thus,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + beta ).

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T = b / lambda_emit = (b (1 + beta )) / lambda_obs.

Thus,

T = T_obs * (1 + beta ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + beta ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = 1.023333 T_obs.

So,

L1 =4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

Ratio,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1 / (1.023333 )^4 )

As, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09735,

So,

2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse of the ratio. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed luminosity is lower, so perhaps the ratio is inverted.

Wait, no, the problem asks for the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed luminosity of Star_2 is lower due to Doppler shift, so when you compute their intrinsic luminosities, L1 is larger than L2.

But according to the calculation, L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

Given that the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~2.23, but I don't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 / 1.023333^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.023333^4.

1.023333^2 = 1.04721044.

Now, square that:

1.04721044^2 = ?

Compute:

1.04721044 × 1.04721044.

Breakdown:

= 1 × 1.04721044 = 1.04721044

+ 0.04 × 1.04721044 = 0.0418884176

+ 0.0072 × 1.04721044 ≈ 0.007533553.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1.04721044 × 1.04721044.

= (1 + 0.04721044 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04721044 ) + (0.04721044 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09442088 + 0.00222917.

= 1.09665.

So,

1.023333^4 = 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm.

Since I can't find an error in my calculations, perhaps the correct answer is closest to option D) ~2.23, but I don't see how to reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the options provided are limited.

But given the options, the closest to 2.05 is not present, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the luminosity is computed using the observed flux, which is affected by the Doppler shift.

In that case, the observed flux F_obs = L_emit / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

But without knowing d, perhaps the problem assumes d is the same for both stars, leading to F_obs proportional to L_emit (1 + z )^{-1}.

So, F_obs1 / F_obs2 = (L1 (1 + 0) ) / ( L2 (1 + 0.023333 ) )

But the problem states that the luminosities are computed as L1 and L2, so perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed flux to compute the luminosity, which would be L_obs = F_obs * 4 pi d^2.

But without knowing d, this approach isn't feasible.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only possible answer based on the calculations is approximately 2.05, which isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see how to reach that number.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.023333^4 using more precise steps.

Compute 1.023333^2:

1.023333 * 1.023333.

= 1 * 1.023333 = 1.023333.

0.023333 * 1.023333 = 0.02391107.

So sum is 1.023333 + 0.02391107 = 1.04724407.

Now, compute (1.04724407)^2.

Break it down:

1.04724407 × 1.04724407.

= (1 + 0.04724407 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04724407 ) + (0.04724407 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09448814 + 0.00223207.

= 1 + 0.09448814 = 1.09448814 + 0.00223207 = 1.09672021.

So, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09672.

Thus,

2.25 / 1.09672 ≈ 2.25 ÷ 1.09672 ≈ ?

Compute 1.09672 × 2 = 2.19344,

Which is less than 2.25. The difference is 2.25−2.19344=0.05656.

Compute 0.05656 / 1.09672 ≈ 0.0516.

So,

2.25 / 1.09672 ≈ 2.0516.

So, approximately 2.05.

Still, no match.

Given that, I think the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see how to get there with the information provided. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 2.23, but I'm missing something.

The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and the same mass. Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to compute by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   - The observed peak wavelength, $\lambda_{\text{obs}}$, is the same for both stars. Using Wien's Law, $\lambda_{\text{obs}} = b / T_{\text{obs}}$, where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $T_{\text{obs}}$ is the observed temperature.
   - For Star_2, which is moving away at $v = 700$ km/s, the intrinsic temperature $T_2$ is related to the observed temperature $T_{\text{obs}}$ by the Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot (1 + v/c),
     \]
     where $c$ is the speed of light. Substituting $v/c \approx 0.02333$, we find:
     \[
     T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333.
     \]
   - For Star_1, $T_1 = T_{\text{obs}}$ since it is stationary.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
     \]
     where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the temperature, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - For Star_1 and Star_2:
     \[
     L_1 = 4 \pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \sigma T_1^4, \quad L_2 = 4 \pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4.
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}\right).
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values**:
   - Since $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, we have:
     \[
     \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
     \]
   - From the Doppler shift, $T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333$, so:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{T_{\text{obs}}}{T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333} = \frac{1}{1.02333}.
     \]
   - Raise this ratio to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.02333}\right)^4.
     \]
   - Compute $1.02333^4$:
     \[
     1.02333^2 \approx 1.04721, \quad 1.04721^2 \approx 1.09735.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.09735}.
     \]

4. **Final Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Combine the results:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.09735} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.91004 \approx 2.05.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated ratio is approximately $2.05$, but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **D) ~2.23**, though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear based on the given problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The calculations consistently yield a luminosity ratio of approximately $2.05$, but since this is not among the options, the closest match is **D) ~2.23**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, I think using Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because Wien's Law is lambda_max = constant / T. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity—I remember that's the speed at which a star is moving towards or away from us. But wait, since Star_1 has zero radial velocity, it's not moving relative to us along the line of sight. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. How does that affect things?

The question is about luminosity. The astronomers assumed they radiate as black bodies. So I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since we're considering them as black bodies, that should apply.

But wait, luminosity also depends on the star's distance. Because if a star is moving, especially if it's moving away, its light is redshifted. Oh! Because of the Doppler effect. So the observed luminosity would be affected by any redshift due to their velocities.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity. So are they calculating the intrinsic luminosity (L) or the observed luminosity (which would be affected by distance and redshift)? Hmm. The question says they computed the luminosity, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So I think they are considering the intrinsic luminosity, which depends on R and T. But wait, because of the Doppler shift, the observed temperature might be affected because the wavelength is shifted. Because if a star is moving away, the wavelengths are stretched (redshifted), which would mean the observed temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which implies that after considering Doppler shift, their temperatures are the same. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So from our perspective, their peak emission is at the same wavelength. But because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. So its actual (intrinsic) temperature must be higher. Because when it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the observed T is lower. But since the observed lambda_max is the same for both, that means to have the same observed wavelength, Star_2's intrinsic temperature must be higher. Because a higher T would emit at a shorter wavelength, but when redshifted, it ends up at the same observed lambda as Star_1, which is stationary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model it.

Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approx 2.898×10^-3 m·K).

For Star_1: It's at rest, so observed lambda_max = lambda1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: It's moving away at velocity v. The observed wavelength would be longer due to redshift. The Doppler formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). But when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit * (1 + v/c). Because v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333… So it's a small v/c, so using the approximation should be okay.

So for Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But according to the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So:

lambda1 = lambda2 * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda1 is b / T1, and lambda2 is b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / (1) ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, no, solving for T2.

Wait, let's do the algebra.

From 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But wait, isn't that the opposite? Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so its emitted wavelength must be shorter. Which would mean a higher temperature. So T2 > T1.

Wait, let me check again.

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c )

If v is positive (moving away), lambda_obs is longer than lambda_emit.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 / (1 + v2/c )

But since lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda1,

lambda_emit2 = lambda1 / (1 + v2/c ) = (b / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_emit2 is also equal to b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

Simplify:

1 / T2 = (1 / T1 ) / (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 and T1,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Which leads to:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So yes, T2 is higher than T1.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Now, I can compute (1 + v2/c ). v2 is 700 km/s.

Wait, let me compute v2/c.

v2 = 700,000 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 = approx 0.023333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.023333...

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.023333.

So, T2 is about 2.33% higher than T1.

Now, move on to calculate their luminosities.

Luminosity of a star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

The question states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's radius. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait no, wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2? Let me recheck the question.

Question says: "Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2." So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

So, R1² = (1.5 R2)² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1 = 4 π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4

L2 = 4 π R2² σ T2^4

So the ratio L1 / L2 = (2.25 R2² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which simplifies to 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4.

We know T2 is T1 * 1.023333 approximately, so T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^4.

Compute step by step:

0.977^2 = approx 0.977 * 0.977. Let me compute:

0.977 * 0.977:
= (1 - 0.023)²
= 1 - 2*(0.023) + (0.023)^2
≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529
≈ 0.954529.

So 0.977^2 ≈ 0.955.

Then, 0.955^2 ≈ (0.955)^2 = 0.912025.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.912.

So,

L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.25 * 0.912.

Compute 2.25 * 0.912:

2 * 0.912 =1.824.

0.25 *0.912= 0.228.

So total is 1.824 + 0.228 = 2.052.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. But the options are around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the approximation is too rough.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

First, let me compute (1 + v/c) exactly.

v = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3 * 10^8 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.023333333.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023333333 = approx 0.97707.

Wait, let me compute 1.023333333^−1.

Compute 1 / 1.023333333.

Well, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x^3 for small x.

x = 0.0233333.

So 1/(1.023333333) ≈ 1 - 0.0233333 + (0.0233333)^2 - (0.0233333)^3.

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: -0.0233333 → 0.9766667.

Third term: (0.0233333)^2 = approx 0.0005444 → 0.9766667 + 0.0005444 ≈ 0.977211.

Fourth term: -(0.0233333)^3 ≈ -(0.00001268) → 0.977211 - 0.00001268 ≈ 0.977198.

So approx 0.977198.

So, T1/T2 ≈ 0.977198.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977198)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.977198 squared:

Compute 0.977198 * 0.977198.

Let me compute:

Let me write 0.977198 as approximately 0.9772.

0.9772 * 0.9772.

= (0.97 + 0.0072)²

= 0.97² + 2*0.97*0.0072 + (0.0072)^2

= 0.9409 + 2*(0.006984) + 0.00005184

= 0.9409 + 0.013968 + 0.00005184

≈ 0.9409 + 0.013968 = 0.954868 + 0.00005184 ≈ 0.95491984.

So 0.9772 squared is about 0.95492.

Now, square that again to get (0.9772)^4.

0.95492 squared:

= (0.95 + 0.00492)^2

= 0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.00492) + (0.00492)^2

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.95*0.00492) + 0.0000242

Compute 0.95 * 0.00492 = 0.004674. Multiply by 2 → 0.009348.

So 0.9025 + 0.009348 = 0.911848 + 0.0000242 ≈ 0.911872.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.911872.

Now, putting it all together.

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911872.

2.25 * 0.911872.

Compute 2 * 0.911872 = 1.823744.

0.25 * 0.911872 = 0.227968.

Add them together: 1.823744 + 0.227968 = 2.051712.

So approximately 2.0517.

But the options are:

A) ~2.25,

B) ~2.32,

C) ~2.35,

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none of these are near 2.05. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Doppler shift effect on the temperature. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observed temperature is T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait no, the Doppler effect for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit ( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )^{1/2} }, but when v << c, it's approximately 1 + beta, but maybe I should use the exact formula.

Wait, let me clarify.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Where beta = v/c.

Wait, no. Let me get the correct formula.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula for light is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) )

But this is when the source is moving away (v is positive). So I think I should use this exact formula, not the approximation.

So, for Star_2, moving away with v=700 km/s, beta = v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But in the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, since the peak wavelengths are the same.

So,

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But,

lambda1_emit = b / T1,

lambda2_emit = b / T2,

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So let's compute sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) with beta=0.023333.

Compute numerator: 1 + beta = 1.0233333

Denominator: 1 - beta = 0.9766667.

So (1.0233333 / 0.9766667 ) ≈ (1.0233333)/(0.9766667) ≈ 1.047619.

So sqrt(1.047619) ≈ 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023518.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023518 ≈ 0.9767.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.9767)^4.

Compute 0.9767^4.

First, compute 0.9767 squared.

0.9767 * 0.9767.

Let me compute:

0.9767 * 0.9767 ≈ (approx 0.976^2)

0.976^2 = (1 - 0.024)^2 = 1 - 0.048 + 0.000576 = 0.952576.

Wait, but 0.9767^2.

Compute 0.9767 * 0.9767:

Breakdown:

= (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.0067) * (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.0067)

But perhaps a better way is to compute 9767 * 9767 and then adjust the decimal.

Alternatively, use the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Let a = 0.97, b = 0.0067.

So,

(0.97 + 0.0067)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2*(0.97)(0.0067) + (0.0067)^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2*0.97 *0.0067 = 2 * 0.006509 = 0.013018.

(0.0067)^2 = 0.00004489.

So sum is 0.9409 + 0.013018 = 0.953918 + 0.00004489 ≈ 0.953963.

So, 0.9767^2 ≈ 0.95396.

Now, square that to get (0.9767)^4.

0.95396 squared.

Again,

= (0.95 + 0.00396)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.00396) + (0.00396)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00396 = 2 * 0.003762 → 0.007524.

(0.00396)^2 ≈ 0.00001568.

So sum is 0.9025 + 0.007524 = 0.910024 + 0.00001568 ≈ 0.91003968.

So, (0.9767)^4 ≈ 0.91004.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91004 ≈ 2.0526.

Wait, same result as before. So that gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is D) ~2.23, but that’s higher. I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So the ratio is L1/L2.

Wait, but what if the mass comes into play? Because the problem says both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't a factor. So why was the mass given?

Wait, perhaps I missed something else. Let me go back to the problem.

The problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the calculation is about the ratio of their luminosities.

Wait, but I think I may have messed up the ratio.

Wait, L1 is based on R1 and T1, and L2 on R2 and T2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

so R1² = 2.25 R2².

But T1 and T2 are related through the Doppler shift as earlier.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4 = 4π R2² σ (2.25 T1^4 )

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1 = 2.25 * ( T1^4 / T2^4 ) * L2.

Wait no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the ratio.

Wait, L1 = 4 π R1² σ T1^4 =4 π (1.5 R2 )² σ T1^4 = 4 π R2² σ ( (1.5)^2 T1^4 ) = 4 π R2² σ (2.25 T1^4 )

L2 = 4 π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (2.25 T1^4 ) / T2^4 = 2.25 (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Earlier, I thought (T1/T2) = 0.977, so (T1/T2)^4 = 0.91, leading to 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

But according to the problem, the factor is higher than that, around 2.23.

So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity, not just the temperature.

Wait, because when a star is moving away, the observed flux is lower because of the redshift. Because the photons are less energetic and less frequent. So, the observed flux F is L / (4π d²) (1 + z)^{-1}, where z is the redshift.

Wait, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed as if they are black bodies, but perhaps the actual observed luminosity is being considered, which would involve the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in the rest frame of the star.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that Star_2 is moving away, so its observed flux is lower. But the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps their approach is to calculate the intrinsic luminosity, but when considering the Doppler shift, the observed temperature is lower, which affects the calculation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try an alternative approach.

Let me recap:

- Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, lambda_obs.

- Star_1 is at rest, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit1 = b / T1.

- Star_2 is moving away at v, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c) ≈ lambda_emit2 (1 + beta), where beta = v/c.

But lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs1 / (1 + beta) ) = (b / T1) / (1 + beta)

But lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + beta)

=> T2 = T1 (1 + beta )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + beta ), with beta = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977 * T2.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought T2 was larger than T1. Because T2 = T1 * (1 + beta ), so T2 is higher.

So, T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + beta )) ≈ 0.977 T2.

Wait, but that would mean T1 is lower than T2, which makes sense because Star_2's light is redshifted, making its observed emission peak at the same lambda as Star_1. So Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength (higher T) to appear at a longer observed wavelength.

So, now, with T2 higher than T1, but R1 is 1.5 R2.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2,

(R1²)/(R2²) = (2.25) 

And,

T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + beta )) → so T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

Thus, (T1 / T2 ) = 1/1.023333 ≈ 0.97707.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (0.97707)^4 ≈ 0.9100.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9100 ≈ 2.051.

Again, same as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.05. The closest option is D) ~2.23, which is higher than 2.05.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe I should use exact values without approximations.

Let me compute (1 + beta) exactly.

Beta = 700,000 / (3e8) = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.02333333333.

So,

1 + beta = 1.0233333333.

sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1.0233333333) / (0.9766666667) )

Compute (1.0233333333)/(0.9766666667) = 1.0476190476.

The square root of 1.0476190476 is:

√1.0476190476 ≈ 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023518.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1/1.023518 ≈ 0.9767.

(T1/T2 )^4 ≈ (0.9767)^4.

Compute 0.9767^2 = ?

Using exact calculation:

0.9767 × 0.9767:

= (0.97 × 0.97 ) + (0.97 × 0.0067 × 2 ) + (0.0067 × 0.0067 )

= 0.9409 + (0.006509 × 2 ) + 0.00004489

= 0.9409 + 0.013018 + 0.00004489 = 0.95396289.

Now, square that:

(0.95396289)^2.

= (0.95 + 0.00396289)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95 * 0.00396289) + (0.00396289)^2.

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.00376475) + 0.000015708.

= 0.9025 + 0.0075295 + 0.000015708 ≈ 0.9100452.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.910045.

Then,

L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 0.910045 ≈ 2.0526.

Which is approximately 2.053.

But the given options are all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler effect. Maybe I should calculate how the flux is affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, the flux observed from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

Because when a star is moving away, the flux is dimmed due to the redshift. But the problem says that the stars' luminosities were computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps their actual intrinsic luminosity is being considered, not the observed flux.

Wait, but the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the luminosity is as observed from Earth, considering the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the observed flux to compute luminosity, which would involve the redshift.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think.

Wait, the luminosity as seen from Earth would be L_obs = L_intrinsic * (1 + z)^{-1}.

Because when a star is moving away, each photon's energy is reduced by (1 + z), and the number of photons per second is also reduced by (1 + z) due to time dilation. So the flux is F = L_intrinsic / [4 pi d^2 (1 + z) ]

But the problem states that the stars' luminosities were computed as black bodies, so perhaps I should be computing their intrinsic luminosities based on their emitted wavelengths, which are affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's model each star's emitted spectrum.

Star_1 is at rest, so its emission is at T1, and its luminosity is L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

Star_2 is moving away at v, so its emitted spectrum is at T2, but we observe it as having a temperature T2_obs = T2 / (1 + v/c ), due to the redshift. But wait, no, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So,

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

Which implies,

lambda_emit_1 * (1 + v_1/c ) = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_2/c )

But Star_1 has v1 = 0, so,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 )

So,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 0.0233333 )

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1.0233333 )

=> T2 = T1 * 1.0233333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0233333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.0233333 ≈ 0.977 T2.

Wait, now R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4 = 4 pi ( (1.5 R2 )^2 ) sigma ( (T2 / 1.0233333 )^4 )

= 4 pi R2^2 sigma ( (2.25) ) ( T2^4 / (1.0233333)^4 )

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 = L2 * (2.25) / (1.0233333)^4.

Compute (1.0233333)^4:

As before, 1.0233333^4 ≈ 1.0233333^2 squared.

1.0233333^2 ≈ 1.047619.

Then, 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

L1 = L2 * (2.25) / 1.09735 ≈ L2 * 2.25 / 1.09735.

Compute 2.25 / 1.09735.

2.25 ÷ 1.09735 ≈ Let me compute:

1.09735 * 2 = 2.1947.

Which is just under 2.25. 2.1947 + 0.0553 = 2.25.

So 1.09735 * 2.05 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, more accurately.

Let me compute 1.09735 * 2.05.

= 1.09735 * 2 = 2.1947.

1.09735 * 0.05 = 0.0548675.

Total ≈ 2.1947 + 0.0548675 = 2.2495675.

So, 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm trying to find x where 1.09735 * x = 2.25.

So x = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, so,

L1 / L2 = 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, why don't the options match this?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which star is hotter. Let me re-express.

Wait, I have L1 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) * L2.

But since T2 = 1.023333 T1,

T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (1/1.023333 )^4.

Which is (approx 0.9767 )^4 ≈ 0.91.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed luminosity.

The observed flux from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) (1 + z)^{-1}.

But the problem states that the luminosities were computed, so perhaps the observed flux is F = L / (4 pi d^2) (1 + v/c ), assuming v << c and using the approximation (1 + z) ≈ 1 + v/c.

Wait, no, for recessional velocity, (1 + z) = 1 + v/c, so flux F = L / [4 pi d^2 (1 + v/c ) ].

But the problem says they computed the luminosity as black bodies, so perhaps they used the observed flux and calculated the luminosity based on that.

Wait, but if the observed flux is F_obs = F_emit / (1 + v/c ), then the observed luminosity (from Earth) would be L_obs = 4 pi d^2 F_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ).

So, L_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ).

But then, the intrinsic luminosity is higher. But the problem says the luminosity computed is based on the black body assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the observed luminosity, which would be lower due to the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the question is about the computed luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed luminosity is lower. So the computed L (from observed data) would be L1 (computed) = L1_intrinsic, and L2_computed = L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c ).

So, the ratio (L1_computed / L2_computed) = [ L1_intrinsic ] / [ L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c ) ] = (L1/L2) * (1 + v2/c )

But earlier, we have L1/L2 = 2.05.

So,

(L1_computed/L2_computed) = 2.05 * (1 + 0.0233333) ≈ 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.10.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the luminosity is computed using the observed parameters, so including the Doppler effect.

Wait, perhaps the method is:

Compute L using the observed flux, which would be F_observed = F_intrinsic / (1 + z).

But the astronomers are computing the intrinsic luminosity, which would be L_intrinsic = F_obs * 4 pi d^2 * (1 + z).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same when observed. So the observed temperatures are the same.

Wait, but that's not the case. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature than Star_1. But the problem states they have the same observed wavelength, so they must have different intrinsic temperatures.

So, as established, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ) = 1.02333 T1.

So, perhaps I should compute the luminosity according to their intrinsic parameters, which are R1 =1.5 R2, T1, T2 = 1.02333 T1.

So,

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (1.023333 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.023333)^4 )

Compute 1.023333^4:

As before, 1.023333^2 ≈ 1.047619,

Then, 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the observed luminosity, which would be L_observed = L_intrinsic * (1 + z)^{-1}.

So,

L1_observed = L1_intrinsic,

L2_observed = L2_intrinsic / (1 + v2/c )

So,

L1_obs / L2_obs = (L1 / L2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

= 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.05 * 1.023 ≈ 2.10.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the luminosity is calculated using the observed wavelengths and temperatures, which are the same.

Wait, but the observed temperature would be lower for Star_2.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed lambda_max is the same, but their intrinsic lambda_max are different.

So, using observed lambda_max, the temperatures are computed as T_obs = b / lambda_max.

Since lambda_max is same, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But the intrinsic temperatures are T1 and T2 = T_obs1 * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Let me outline the data:

- Star_1: R1 = 1.5 R2, v1 = 0 km/s.

- Star_2: R2, v2 = 700 km/s.

- Both have same observed lambda_max.

Assume they are black bodies.

Compute L1 / L2.

Approach:

1. Find the relation between T1 and T2 using the observed lambda_max.

2. Express L1 and L2 in terms of R1, R2, T1, T2.

3. Compute the ratio.

From step 1:

lambda_obs = b / T_obs.

But for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c ) → so:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v/c )

But lambda_emit_2 = b / T2.

Thus,

lambda_obs = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

But lambda_obs for Star_1 is b / T1.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c ) / T2 → T2 = T1 (1 + v/c ).

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Step 2:

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

Ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (T1 * 1.023333 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.023333 )^4 )

Compute (1.023333 )^4:

As before, approx 1.09735.

So,

2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

So, same result again.

But none of the options match. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 using exact steps.

Compute 1.023333 squared:

1.023333 × 1.023333.

Do this multiplication step by step.

1.023333 × 1.023333:

Compute 1 × 1.023333 = 1.023333.

Compute 0.02 × 1.023333 = 0.02046666.

Compute 0.003333 × 1.023333 ≈ 0.0034111.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute (1 + 0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.023333 + (0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.00054444.

= 1.047210.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.047619. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.023333 squared is 0.023333 * 0.023333 = approximately 0.0005444.

So,

(1.023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.023333 + 0.0005444 = 1 + 0.046666 + 0.0005444 = 1.0472104.

Then, (1.0472104)^2.

= (1.0472104)^2.

Compute this as:

= (1 + 0.0472104 )^2 = 1 + 2*0.0472104 + (0.0472104)^2.

= 1 + 0.0944208 + 0.0022291.

= 1 + 0.0944208 = 1.0944208 + 0.0022291 = 1.09665.

So,

(1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.25 ÷ 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, the given options are all higher than this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed flux, including both the dimming and the shift in wavelength.

The flux observed from a star is given by:

F_obs = (L_emit) / (4 pi d^2) ) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

But since we don't know the distance, perhaps the problem assumes the same distance for both stars, which is not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed flux is used to compute the luminosity, including the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem says the luminosity is computed as if they are black bodies. So perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the observed parameters, which would mean that the observed temperature is used.

Wait, but if we calculate luminosity using the observed temperature, then:

L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_obs^4.

But R is the intrinsic radius, not the observed radius.

Wait, but if we don't know the distance, we can't get R from observed data. So perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed peak wavelength to calculate the temperature, and then compute the luminosity based on the intrinsic radius and observed temperature.

Wait, but that would not make sense, because the observed temperature is lower due to Doppler shift, leading to lower luminosity.

Wait, let's think.

If the stars have the same observed lambda_max, then their observed temperatures are the same, T_obs.

But their intrinsic temperatures are different.

So,

For Star_1 (v1=0), T_obs1 = T1.

For Star_2 (v2=700 km/s), T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

But since T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Now, luminosity for each star is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_intrinsic^4.

So,

L1 =4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma T_obs^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So, compute L1/L2.

= [ (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma T_obs^4 ] / [ R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4 ]

= (2.25 R2^2 ) / R2^2 * T_obs^4 / (1.023333^4 T_obs^4 )

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 )

As before, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result.

So, I'm repeatedly getting 2.05, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should include the Doppler effect in the calculation of the observed luminosity. The observed luminosity would be L_obs = L_emit / (1 + v/c ), because of the redshift.

So,

L1_obs = L1_emit.

L2_obs = L2_emit / (1 + v2/c )

So,

L1_obs / L2_obs = (L1 / L2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

= 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.05 * 1.023333 ≈ 2.10.

Still doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed radius, but that doesn't make sense as radius isn't observed directly but via other means like angular size or surface gravity.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed radius is affected by Doppler shift. But no, the radius is determined from other methods, like the star's spectral lines' broadening, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I've mixed up the observed and intrinsic temperatures, leading to the wrong ratio.

Wait, let me try using the observed temperatures.

Since observed lambda_max is the same, T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs.

So,

For Star_1:

T_obs = T1.

For Star_2:

T_obs = T2 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

Similarly,

Star_1's T1 = T_obs.

So,

L1 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma (T_obs )^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So, L1/L2 = [ (2.25 R2^2) * T_obs^4 ] / [ R2^2 * (1.023333 T_obs )^4 ]

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 )

As before, 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

I think I'm stuck. The calculation consistently leads to L1/L2 ~2.05, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosities are computed assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the observed flux is being used to compute the luminosity, which would involve the Doppler shift.

The flux F from a star is F = L / (4 pi d²) (1 + z)^{-1}.

But if the distance d is the same for both stars, then the observed flux F is proportional to L (1 + z)^{-1}.

But the problem doesn't state that the stars are at the same distance. So perhaps distance is not a factor here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the Doppler shift in terms of the observed flux, but without knowing the distance, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the peak wavelength and the Doppler shift to calculate the intrinsic temperature, and then using that to compute the luminosity.

Wait, given that, the observed peak wavelength is the same, so T_obs is the same.

But for Star_2, T_intrinsic = T_obs * (1 + v/c ).

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Thus, L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2 )² sigma (T_obs )^4.

L2 =4 pi R2² sigma (1.023333 T_obs )^4.

So,

L1/L2= (2.25 R2² T_obs^4 ) / ( R2² (1.023333^4 T_obs^4 ) )

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Same result again.

I'm not seeing a way to get to the options given. The only possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 accurately.

1.023333^2 = 1.023333 * 1.023333.

Compute:

1.023333 × 1.023333:

= (1 + 0.023333) × (1 + 0.023333 )

= 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.00054444

= 1.04721044.

Now, 1.04721044 squared:

= (1.04721044)^2.

Compute this as:

= (1 + 0.04721044 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04721044 ) + (0.04721044 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09442088 + 0.00222917.

= 1 + 0.09442088 = 1.09442088 + 0.00222917 ≈ 1.09665005.

So,

(1.023333)^4 = 1.09665.

Thus, 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm. So I think I'm confident in this result, but the options don't have 2.05. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the radius measurement. But I don't think so, because the radius is determined through other means, not the observed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic Doppler shift without the approximation. Let me try that.

The exact Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Where beta = v/c = 0.023333.

So,

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1.023333)/(0.976667) ) ≈ sqrt(1.047619) ≈ 1.023518.

So,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / 1.023518.

For Star_2,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / 1.023518.

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = b / (lambda_obs / 1.023518 ) = (b / lambda_obs ) * 1.023518 = T_obs * 1.023518.

So,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023518.

So,

T1 = T_obs.

Thus,

L1 =4 pi (1.5 R2 )^2 sigma (T_obs )^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma (1.023518 T_obs )^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2^2 T_obs^4 ) / ( R2^2 (1.023518^4 T_obs^4 ) )

= 2.25 / (1.023518^4 )

Compute 1.023518^4.

Compute 1.023518 squared: 1.023518 × 1.023518.

= approx 1.047619.

Then, square that: 1.047619^2 ≈ 1.09735.

So,

1.023518^4 ≈ 1.09735.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Same result again.

So, I think my calculations are correct, but the options don't match. It's possible that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2 )^4.

With R1 =1.5 R2 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

Wait, no, earlier analysis showed T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So,

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c ).

So,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c ).

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T = b / lambda_emit = (b (1 + v/c )) ) / lambda_obs.

So,

T = T_obs * (1 + v/c ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * 1.023333.

Thus,

(T1/T2 )^4 = (1 / 1.023333 )^4 ≈ (0.9767 )^4 ≈ 0.91.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.05.

So, again, same result.

Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach that I'm not seeing.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed radius, but that doesn't make sense because the radius is determined via other methods, not via wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Doppler shift to adjust the radius as well, but that's not a standard approach.

Wait, another approach: Considering that the observed flux is the same for both stars, but that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed luminosity, which would be lower for Star_2.

But the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the answer is 2.05, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says:

"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

Which implies that T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Thus, T_obs = lambda_max = b / T.

So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Which leads to T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

Wait, earlier I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.

Wait, the Doppler formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * ( sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

But for small beta, lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + beta ).

Thus,

lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + beta ).

But,

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

T = b / lambda_emit = (b (1 + beta )) / lambda_obs.

Thus,

T = T_obs * (1 + beta ).

So,

T2 = T_obs * (1 + beta ) = T_obs * 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = 1.023333 T_obs.

So,

L1 =4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4,

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

Ratio,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1 / (1.023333 )^4 )

As, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09735,

So,

2.25 / 1.09735 ≈ 2.05.

Same result.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse of the ratio. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed luminosity is lower, so perhaps the ratio is inverted.

Wait, no, the problem asks for the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed luminosity of Star_2 is lower due to Doppler shift, so when you compute their intrinsic luminosities, L1 is larger than L2.

But according to the calculation, L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

Given that the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~2.23, but I don't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 / 1.023333^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.023333^4.

1.023333^2 = 1.04721044.

Now, square that:

1.04721044^2 = ?

Compute:

1.04721044 × 1.04721044.

Breakdown:

= 1 × 1.04721044 = 1.04721044

+ 0.04 × 1.04721044 = 0.0418884176

+ 0.0072 × 1.04721044 ≈ 0.007533553.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1.04721044 × 1.04721044.

= (1 + 0.04721044 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04721044 ) + (0.04721044 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09442088 + 0.00222917.

= 1.09665.

So,

1.023333^4 = 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm.

Since I can't find an error in my calculations, perhaps the correct answer is closest to option D) ~2.23, but I don't see how to reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the options provided are limited.

But given the options, the closest to 2.05 is not present, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the luminosity is computed using the observed flux, which is affected by the Doppler shift.

In that case, the observed flux F_obs = L_emit / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + z)^{-1}.

But without knowing d, perhaps the problem assumes d is the same for both stars, leading to F_obs proportional to L_emit (1 + z )^{-1}.

So, F_obs1 / F_obs2 = (L1 (1 + 0) ) / ( L2 (1 + 0.023333 ) )

But the problem states that the luminosities are computed as L1 and L2, so perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the observed flux to compute the luminosity, which would be L_obs = F_obs * 4 pi d^2.

But without knowing d, this approach isn't feasible.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only possible answer based on the calculations is approximately 2.05, which isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see how to reach that number.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.023333^4 using more precise steps.

Compute 1.023333^2:

1.023333 * 1.023333.

= 1 * 1.023333 = 1.023333.

0.023333 * 1.023333 = 0.02391107.

So sum is 1.023333 + 0.02391107 = 1.04724407.

Now, compute (1.04724407)^2.

Break it down:

1.04724407 × 1.04724407.

= (1 + 0.04724407 )^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04724407 ) + (0.04724407 )^2.

= 1 + 0.09448814 + 0.00223207.

= 1 + 0.09448814 = 1.09448814 + 0.00223207 = 1.09672021.

So, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09672.

Thus,

2.25 / 1.09672 ≈ 2.25 ÷ 1.09672 ≈ ?

Compute 1.09672 × 2 = 2.19344,

Which is less than 2.25. The difference is 2.25−2.19344=0.05656.

Compute 0.05656 / 1.09672 ≈ 0.0516.

So,

2.25 / 1.09672 ≈ 2.0516.

So, approximately 2.05.

Still, no match.

Given that, I think the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see how to get there with the information provided. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 2.23, but I'm missing something.


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and the same mass. Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to compute by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   - The observed peak wavelength, $\lambda_{\text{obs}}$, is the same for both stars. Using Wien's Law, $\lambda_{\text{obs}} = b / T_{\text{obs}}$, where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $T_{\text{obs}}$ is the observed temperature.
   - For Star_2, which is moving away at $v = 700$ km/s, the intrinsic temperature $T_2$ is related to the observed temperature $T_{\text{obs}}$ by the Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot (1 + v/c),
     \]
     where $c$ is the speed of light. Substituting $v/c \approx 0.02333$, we find:
     \[
     T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333.
     \]
   - For Star_1, $T_1 = T_{\text{obs}}$ since it is stationary.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
     \]
     where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the temperature, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - For Star_1 and Star_2:
     \[
     L_1 = 4 \pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \sigma T_1^4, \quad L_2 = 4 \pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4.
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}\right).
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values**:
   - Since $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, we have:
     \[
     \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
     \]
   - From the Doppler shift, $T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333$, so:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{T_{\text{obs}}}{T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.02333} = \frac{1}{1.02333}.
     \]
   - Raise this ratio to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.02333}\right)^4.
     \]
   - Compute $1.02333^4$:
     \[
     1.02333^2 \approx 1.04721, \quad 1.04721^2 \approx 1.09735.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.09735}.
     \]

4. **Final Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Combine the results:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.09735} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.91004 \approx 2.05.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated ratio is approximately $2.05$, but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **D) ~2.23**, though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear based on the given problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The calculations consistently yield a luminosity ratio of approximately $2.05$, but since this is not among the options, the closest match is **D) ~2.23**.

ANSWER: D
