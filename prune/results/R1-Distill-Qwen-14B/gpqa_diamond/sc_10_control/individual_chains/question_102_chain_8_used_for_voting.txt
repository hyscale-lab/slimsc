Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: There's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. They're looking at their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The vector has two ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them on Western blot. Total proteins were normalized to actin. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice and looked for green signals, but didn't see any.

So the question is why there's no green signal.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but the construct is for overexpressing both in the same cell. So if they're paracrine, perhaps they can't act on each other if expressed in the same cell? Hmm, maybe not the main issue here. The problem is with the expression of the receptor-eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't getting secreted or expressed on the cell surface, then you wouldn't see green. But the vector uses IRES for the receptor. Wait, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor should be expressed. But maybe the eGFP is not properly tagged? Or perhaps the stop cassette isn't being removed correctly.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the receptor isn't expressed. But I'm not sure if the CBA promoter includes enhancers or if IRES needs an enhancer. IRES elements usually drive low-level expression without needing a strong promoter, but maybe without an enhancer, it's not working. But in this case, the construct is in a vector, so perhaps the promoters are sufficient.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed correctly. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning two separate ORFs. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, then after the stop cassette (loxP). Then, IRES is upstream of the receptor, right? So the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF, so the eGFP is at the end of the receptor ORF. So if the construct is in frame, the eGFP would be part of the receptor-expressed protein. If it's not in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't being produced because the stop codon is encountered early.

Wait, but the vector design is a bicistronic vector with two separate ORFs. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, then the receptor is expressed using IRES. So the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry is for the ligand expression. And the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP would prevent the receptor from expressing unless the stop is removed, perhaps through Cre.

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So the ligand is under CBA, and after the ligand ORF is a stop with loxP. Then the IRES is before the receptor. Wait, the construct is ligand ORF (with stop loxP) then IRES, then receptor ORF (with stop lox2272). So when you have Cre, it would recombine the loxP sites. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand is expressed with mCherry. But the receptor is under IRES, so maybe the IRES allows expression of the receptor even without Cre.

Wait, no. The situation is that the vector is bicistronic, meaning each ORF is under its own promoter. But in this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES. So the way it works is that the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the first ORF (ligand), and then the IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF (receptor). So in normal conditions, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, but the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed because of the stop cassette?

Wait, but the IRES is usually in the same transcript. So the CBA promoter would drive a transcript containing the ligand and then the IRES, after which the receptor would be in the same mRNA. So the IRES allows for translation of the receptor from the same mRNA as the ligand. But because of the stop cassettes, the ligand is followed by a stop, so that the mCherry is only expressed if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop, which is a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The vector is set up so that without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since the CBA promoter is active), but the stop after ligand prevents the downstream IRES and receptor from being expressed. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. But the receptor isn't expressed because the stop is in the way. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, so the stop is removed, allowing the IRES to function, which would translate the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are recombined, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. But in the absence of Cre, only the ligand would be expressed because the IRES and receptor are behind a stop cassette.

In the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, leading to the removal of the stop cassettes. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

Wait, but the construct is in the mouse, so when they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would be expressed in the neural crest, which is where the ligand and receptor are supposed to be active.

Now, when they look for green fluorescence, which is eGFP attached to the receptor. But they don't see any.

Possible issues:

1. The eGFP isn't being expressed. That could be due to the stop cassette not being removed, perhaps because Cre isn't active. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to express Cre in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the vector is in the mouse model. The loxP sites are in the construct. So in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the Western blot, they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Maybe in the Western blot, they saw expression of the ligand and receptor? Or perhaps not.

Wait, the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and doing Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the transient transfection, they saw expression. But in the mouse model, perhaps something went wrong.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the construct is inserted into the genome. When they cross it with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the loxP sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the problem statement, after the offspring are born, they visualize them under the confocal. They don't see green, which is eGFP. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent proper expression of eGFP, meaning the eGFP might not be produced because the reading frame is disrupted. So when the Cre recombination happens, the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't because the ORF is messed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed, so the eGFP won't either.

Wait, another possibility: The IRES is only for the receptor, so the receptor-eGFP is expressed as a single ORF. But if the eGFP is not in the correct frame, then when the receptor ORF is translated, the eGFP might not be expressed. For example, if the receptor ORF ends and the eGFP starts, but they're not in frame, the ribosome might stop at the frame shift, leading to no eGFP.

Looking at the vector description: The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So it's a single ORF for the receptor-eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't in frame, the fusion protein might not be made, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So in that case, even if the receptor is expressed, the eGFP won't be, so no green signal.

Which would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: The IRES is between the ligand and receptor. In the absence of Cre, the stop cassette after ligand prevents the receptor from being expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But the eGFP is part of the receptor's C-terminus. So if the eGFP isn't in frame, the fusion protein won't be made, and the eGFP won't fluoresce.

So in the mouse model, after Cre recombination, the receptor should be expressed with eGFP. But if the eGFP isn't in frame, that won't happen.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface. But the question suggests that the construct is designed correctly.

So the likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, making option D the correct answer.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is under an IRES element, fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 are used to regulate expression. After crossing a mouse model homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cell, as part of a bicistronic vector. The lack of green signal is more likely due to an issue with eGFP expression rather than a paracrine relationship. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would not be expressed on the cell surface, and no fluorescence would be observed. However, there is no evidence provided in the question to suggest that the construct is improperly trafficked. Additionally, the IRES element is designed to allow translation of the receptor, so this explanation is less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which typically drives low-level expression without requiring a strong enhancer. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the primary cause of the lack of eGFP expression. This option is less plausible.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The receptor is fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the ribosome may terminate translation prematurely, preventing the expression of eGFP. This would result in the receptor being expressed without eGFP, leading to no green signal under the confocal microscope. This explanation aligns well with the observed lack of fluorescence and is the most likely reason for the result.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the lack of green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing the expression of eGFP.
