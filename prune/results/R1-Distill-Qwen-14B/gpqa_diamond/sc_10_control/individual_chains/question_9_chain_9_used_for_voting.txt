Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about molecules and their symmetry, specifically whether they have C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means that the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around an axis and still look the same. The 'h' indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane involved. So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Wait, no, wait. Or is it that 'h' stands for a horizontal plane? Oh right, in point group notation, the different types are like Cn, Dn, T, O, I, etc. But C3h would involve a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another thought: C3h could be the same as the point group D3h, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no, D3h is a different point group. Let me think. The sequence is: C3 is the cyclic group with three-fold rotation. Then, if you add a mirror plane, maybe that's where the 'h' comes in. So C3h would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or perhaps a three-fold rotation and a horizontal reflection.

Alternatively, I might be getting this mixed up. Another approach: think about the structures of each option and see which ones have the required symmetry.

Looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
Option C: triisopropyl borate.
Option D: quinuclidine.

I'm a bit confused about the nomenclature, but let's think structurally.

Triisopropyl borate would be B with three isopropyl groups attached. So, the borate would have a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric. So, the molecule would have three identical substituents. Wait, but is that enough for C3h symmetry?

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure. It's a cage compound with a bridge, I think. Its structure is like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which gives it a chair-like structure. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo with three bridges. I think it has a three-fold symmetry. Or does it? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine has a structure where three bridges meet, so perhaps it has a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Hmm, maybe not. Because if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same, but the mirror plane—like a horizontal one—do quinuclidine have that?

Wait, quinuclidine is a tricyclic compound with three bridges. Its structure is symmetric, but I'm not sure if it has a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry, but I'm getting stuck.

Now, let's think about the other options. Options A and B are some sort of polyfuran compounds. The benzo and triphenyleno parts suggest they have multiple phenyl groups attached.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. So, maybe three furan rings connected in a certain way, with a benzo (phenyl) group attached. How symmetric is that? I'm not entirely sure.

Option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran, perhaps with three phenyl groups attached to a central structure.

Wait, I'm trying to imagine these structures. Let's consider the trifuran part. Trifuran would have three furan rings connected in a way that forms a symmetric structure. If the substituents (like the triphenyl groups) are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Now, let me think about each option's structure.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Each isopropyl group is (CH(CH3)2). So, three identical substituents, each attached to the boron. Since each isopropyl is a tertiary group, the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry around the boron. So, the molecule is symmetric with three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, in trigonal planar geometry, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. But for a horizontal mirror plane, perhaps the molecule can be mirrored across a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, in trigonal planar, the mirror plane would be vertical, not horizontal. So, maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it does have one.

Wait, imagine looking down the axis (the C3 axis). Each isopropyl group is in a plane. If the molecule is symmetric in such a way that a horizontal plane (like cutting through the middle) would mirror it, that's possible. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't have that plane.

Option D: quinuclidine. As I thought before, it's a bicyclo structure with three bridges. Each bridge is a two-carbon unit. If I rotate it 120 degrees, does it look the same? Let me visualize. Quinuclidine's structure is symmetric but perhaps its symmetry is higher. Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis, yes. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, in quinuclidine, the molecule is symmetric in such a way that each of the three bridges is identical. So, if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But a mirror plane would require that one side is a mirror image of the other. Because quinuclidine is a chair-like structure, perhaps it has a mirror plane going through certain points.

Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a center of inversion, making it centrosymmetric. I'm not entirely sure.

So, the question is which of these molecules has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the combination of these two should result in certain symmetry operations.

If a molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then applying the mirror followed by a rotation (or vice versa) would generate other symmetry elements. This would result in a larger symmetry group, perhaps D3h, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, each of the substituents must be arranged symmetrically in a way that reflects across that plane.

Looking back, triisopropyl borate: the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around the central boron. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane as well. Let me imagine the molecule: the boron is at the center, and each isopropyl group is in a plane. If I were to slice the molecule horizontally through the boron, would the two halves be mirror images? It depends on how the substituents are arranged.

Wait, is the molecule planar? No, because the isopropyl groups are three-dimensional. So, the molecule is three-dimensional, and the mirror plane would have to pass through the boron and be horizontal. But in reality, each isopropyl group is in a different plane around the central boron. So, maybe a horizontal mirror plane would not leave the molecule unchanged. Because, for example, the mirror would have to reflect each substituent into another, but if all three are identical, perhaps that works.

Wait, if you have three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, then a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis would actually bisect the molecule. But in this case, maybe the mirror plane would be along one of the substituents. Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the mirror plane would pass through the central atom and lie perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry, which includes a three-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes. But that's not the same as C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the isopropyl groups are arranged such that their methyl branches are pointing in different directions. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Let's consider the other options. Quinuclidine: does it have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis—yes, because it's symmetric in such a way that rotating 120 degrees brings it back. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe. Because if you imagine a plane cutting through the central nitrogen (if it's quinuclidine, which is a nitrogen-containing molecule), but wait no, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine. Wait, it's actually a bridged structure without a nitrogen; no, wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? It's a tertiary amine with a structure that's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, it has a central nitrogen atom with three bridges connected to it. That structure would have a three-fold axis because the three bridges are identical. So, rotating 120 degrees would bring each bridge into the position of the next. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The molecule is symmetric in such a way that perhaps a plane through the nitrogen and perpendicular to the rotation axis could be a mirror. Alternatively, maybe not. Because the structure is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane exists.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... something is the correct answer. Let me think about that.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran: the structure would have three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the trifuran is a three-ring structure, perhaps the phenyl groups are equally spaced around it. So, each phenyl would be 120 degrees apart, making for a three-fold rotation symmetry. Now, does the molecule also have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents (phenyl groups) are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps a horizontal plane through the central structure would act as a mirror.

Wait, but for a mirror plane to exist, the structure must be symmetric across that plane. So, if you have three phenyl groups arranged around a central trifuran, and a mirror plane that is horizontal (perpendicular to the rotation axis), the mirror would have to reflect each phenyl group onto another. But since all three are identical, this could work.

So, which of the options has that?

Looking at the options:

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, the nomenclature is a bit complicated, but I think that the triphenyleno part suggests three phenyl groups attached. So, option A has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran system. If this is arranged symmetrically with each phenyl at 120 degrees, then such a molecule would have three-fold rotational symmetry. If it also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

So, which option is that?

Looking back, the options are A, B, C, D.

The question is which has C3h.

If option A is a trifuran with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, that could have C3h.

Alternatively, option B is benzo, which is a single phenyl group attached to the trifuran. So, perhaps not as symmetric.

Quinuclidine (option D) has three bridges, which are symmetric, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold rotation axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's more symmetric than that.

Another thought: triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, and perhaps that's part of option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct molecule is option B or A.

Alternatively, let me think about the pharmaceutical or natural product context. Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with a certain symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but not a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it does. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Its structure is similar to BF3 but with isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron. Each isopropyl is in a plane, but it's a three-dimensional arrangement. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, a horizontal mirror plane would have to bisect the molecule. For example, imagine looking from above the boron; a mirror plane could slice through the boron and the center of one isopropyl group. But since all three are the same, reflecting across that plane would map the molecule onto itself. Wait, no, because reflecting across that plane would take one isopropyl to another, but since they are all the same, perhaps the mirror plane does exist. So, does that give it C3h symmetry?

Alternatively, think about the point group. Triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar geometry, which is point group D3h. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, trigonal planar is usually point group D3h when there are lone pairs or other factors, but in this case, triisopropyl borate is a neutral molecule with three identical substituents. So, what's the point group? If it's trigonal planar with three identical groups, it's probably point group D3h. Because D3h has a principal three-fold axis, and horizontal and vertical mirror planes.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The trigonal planar geometry typically has a C3 axis and three C2 mirror planes. So, perhaps point group D3h.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry, which is part of the D3h group. So, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, does it include C3h as a subset?

Alternatively, maybe the point group is D3h, so it's higher than C3h.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the molecule has a C3h axis as a symmetry element, not necessarily the entire point group. So, if a molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry.

But which of the options has that?

If option C (triisopropyl borate) has D3h symmetry, then it does have C3h as part of it. So, perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought option A had three phenyl groups attached to a central structure, which would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps option D has C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine is a tricyclic molecule, so maybe it has the required symmetry.

Wait, another way to approach this is to think about the molecular structures. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So, it would have a three-fold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes (so point group D3h). So, maybe it does have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, passing through each substituent and the central atom. So, the horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis, but I'm not sure if that's present.

Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane isn't present in triisopropyl borate, but the vertical ones are. So, it would belong to D3h, which includes a C3h element. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: think about each option's symmetry.

- Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure: B with three isopropyl groups. Geometry: trigonal planar. Point group: D3h. So, it has a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). So, yes, it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Point group D3h has a horizontal mirror plane, a vertical mirror plane, etc. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it has a horizontal mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3h symmetry as part of D3h.

But wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it does have C3h as a symmetry element. So, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the other options have this symmetry.

Wait, but the other options: option A has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. If the trifuran is a three-membered ring with the phenyl groups in a symmetric arrangement, then it would have three-fold rotation. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D is quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo structure, so perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if the mirror plane is horizontal.

Wait, quinuclidine has a structure where three bridges meet. So, each bridge is symmetric. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If I imagine cutting through the molecule, perhaps the plane would pass through the nitrogen (if it's quinuclidine, which is a secondary amine) and reflect the structure. But wait, quinuclidine is a tertiary amine. Its structure is symmetric with three identical bridges. So, if a mirror plane is along one bridge, the others are symmetric, so maybe it does have a mirror plane.

But whether that's a horizontal mirror plane... Hmm, maybe not. Because the plane would be vertical relative to the molecule's orientation.

So, perhaps option C is the correct choice.

Wait, I'm starting to think that triisopropyl borate (option C) does have C3h symmetry. So, the answer would be option C.

But wait, looking at the options given, the choices are A, B, C, D.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine.

So, the correct answer would be C) triisopropyl borate.

Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, which gives it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, wait, another point of view: does the borate have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me think: if I have three identical groups arranged around a central atom in a trigonal planar fashion, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. But in such a structure, each substituent is in a different plane, so perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would reflect one substituent into another. Since the substituents are identical, that's possible. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, hence C3h symmetry.

So, the answer is option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). The molecule must appear unchanged after a 120° rotation and reflection across the horizontal plane.

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. 
- If the phenyl groups are equally spaced around the trifuran core, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). 
- However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is uncertain. The phenyl groups are bulky and may not be symmetrically arranged across a horizontal plane. 
- Thus, this molecule likely lacks **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule has a single phenyl group attached to a trifuran system. 
- The structure lacks the required symmetry for **C₃h symmetry**, as it does not have three identical substituents arranged symmetrically. 
- Therefore, this molecule does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. 
- The trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom provides a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). 
- Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (h), as the three isopropyl groups are identical and symmetrically arranged. 
- This molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with three identical bridges. 
- It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) due to the symmetric arrangement of the bridges. 
- However, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane, as the structure is not symmetric across such a plane. 
- Thus, this molecule does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has **C₃h symmetry**, as it possesses both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Each isopropyl group is (CH(CH3)2). So, three identical substituents, each attached to the boron. Since each isopropyl is a tertiary group, the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry around the boron. So, the molecule is symmetric with three-fold rotational symmetry.

But for a horizontal mirror plane, perhaps the molecule can be mirrored across a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

But a mirror plane would require that one side is a mirror image of the other. Because quinuclidine is a chair-like structure, perhaps it has a mirror plane going through certain points.

If a molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then applying the mirror followed by a rotation (or vice versa) would generate other symmetry elements. This would result in a larger symmetry group, perhaps D3h, but I'm not certain.

Let's consider the other options. Quinuclidine: does it have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis—yes, because it's symmetric in such a way that rotating 120 degrees brings it back. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe. Because if you imagine a plane cutting through the central nitrogen (if it's quinuclidine, which is a nitrogen-containing molecule), but wait no, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine. Wait, it's actually a bridged structure without a nitrogen; no, wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? It's a tertiary amine with a structure that's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, it has a central nitrogen atom with three bridges connected to it. That structure would have a three-fold axis because the three bridges are identical. So, rotating 120 degrees would bring each bridge into the position of the next. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The molecule is symmetric in such a way that perhaps a plane through the nitrogen and perpendicular to the rotation axis could be a mirror. Alternatively, maybe not. Because the structure is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane exists.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... something is the correct answer. Let me think about that.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran: the structure would have three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the trifuran is a three-ring structure, perhaps the phenyl groups are equally spaced around it. So, each phenyl would be 120 degrees apart, making for a three-fold rotation symmetry. Now, does the molecule also have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents (phenyl groups) are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps a horizontal plane through the central structure would act as a mirror.

Wait, but for a mirror plane to exist, the structure must be symmetric across that plane. So, if you have three phenyl groups arranged around a central trifuran, and a mirror plane that is horizontal (perpendicular to the rotation axis), the mirror would have to reflect each phenyl group onto another. But since all three are identical, this could work.

So, which of the options has that?

Looking at the options:

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, the nomenclature is a bit complicated, but I think that the triphenyleno part suggests three phenyl groups attached. So, option A has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran system. If this is arranged symmetrically with each phenyl at 120 degrees, then such a molecule would have three-fold rotational symmetry. If it also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

So, which option is that?

Looking back, the options are A, B, C, D.

The question is which has C3h.

If option A is a trifuran with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, that could have C3h.

Alternatively, option B is benzo, which is a single phenyl group attached to the trifuran. So, perhaps not as symmetric.

Quinuclidine (option D) has three bridges, which are symmetric, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold rotation axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's more symmetric than that.

Another thought: triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, and perhaps that's part of option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct molecule is option B or A.

Alternatively, let me think about the pharmaceutical or natural product context. Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with a certain symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but not a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it does. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Its structure is similar to BF3 but with isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron. Each isopropyl is in a plane, but it's a three-dimensional arrangement. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, a horizontal mirror plane would have to bisect the molecule. For example, imagine looking from above the boron; a mirror plane could slice through the boron and the center of one isopropyl group. But since all three are the same, reflecting across that plane would map the molecule onto itself. Wait, no, because reflecting across that plane would take one isopropyl to another, but since they are all the same, perhaps the mirror plane does exist. So, does that give it C3h symmetry?

Alternatively, think about the point group. Triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar geometry, which is point group D3h. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, trigonal planar is usually point group D3h when there are lone pairs or other factors, but in this case, triisopropyl borate is a neutral molecule with three identical substituents. So, what's the point group? If it's trigonal planar with three identical groups, it's probably point group D3h. Because D3h has a principal three-fold axis, and horizontal and vertical mirror planes.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The trigonal planar geometry typically has a C3 axis and three C2 mirror planes. So, perhaps point group D3h.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry, which is part of the D3h group. So, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, does it include C3h as a subset?

Alternatively, maybe the point group is D3h, so it's higher than C3h.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the molecule has a C3h axis as a symmetry element, not necessarily the entire point group. So, if a molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry.

But which of the options has that?

If option C (triisopropyl borate) has D3h symmetry, then it does have C3h as part of it. So, perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought option A had three phenyl groups attached to a central structure, which would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps option D has C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine is a tricyclic molecule, so maybe it has the required symmetry.

Wait, another way to approach this is to think about the molecular structures. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So, it would have a three-fold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes (so point group D3h). So, maybe it does have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, passing through each substituent and the central atom. So, the horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis, but I'm not sure if that's present.

Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane isn't present in triisopropyl borate, but the vertical ones are. So, it would belong to D3h, which includes a C3h element. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: think about each option's symmetry.

- Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure: B with three isopropyl groups. Geometry: trigonal planar. Point group: D3h. So, it has a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). So, yes, it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Point group D3h has a horizontal mirror plane, a vertical mirror plane, etc. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it has a horizontal mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3h symmetry as part of D3h.

But wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it does have C3h as a symmetry element. So, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the other options have this symmetry.

Wait, but the other options: option A has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. If the trifuran is a three-membered ring with the phenyl groups in a symmetric arrangement, then it would have three-fold rotation. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D is quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo structure, so perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if the mirror plane is horizontal.

Wait, quinuclidine has a structure where three bridges meet. So, each bridge is symmetric. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If I imagine cutting through the molecule, perhaps the plane would pass through the nitrogen (if it's quinuclidine, which is a secondary amine) and reflect the structure. But wait, quinuclidine is a tertiary amine. Its structure is symmetric with three identical bridges. So, if a mirror plane is along one bridge, the others are symmetric, so maybe it does have a mirror plane.

But whether that's a horizontal mirror plane... Hmm, maybe not. Because the plane would be vertical relative to the molecule's orientation.

So, perhaps option C is the correct choice.

Wait, I'm starting to think that triisopropyl borate (option C) does have C3h symmetry. So, the answer would be option C.

But wait, looking at the options given, the choices are A, B, C, D.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine.

So, the correct answer would be C) triisopropyl borate.

Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, which gives it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, wait, another point of view: does the borate have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me think: if I have three identical groups arranged around a central atom in a trigonal planar fashion, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. But in such a structure, each substituent is in a different plane, so perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would reflect one substituent into another. Since the substituents are identical, that's possible. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, hence C3h symmetry.

So, the answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). The molecule must appear unchanged after a 120° rotation and reflection across the horizontal plane.

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. 
- If the phenyl groups are equally spaced around the trifuran core, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). 
- However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is uncertain. The phenyl groups are bulky and may not be symmetrically arranged across a horizontal plane. 
- Thus, this molecule likely lacks **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule has a single phenyl group attached to a trifuran system. 
- The structure lacks the required symmetry for **C₃h symmetry**, as it does not have three identical substituents arranged symmetrically. 
- Therefore, this molecule does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. 
- The trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom provides a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). 
- Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (h), as the three isopropyl groups are identical and symmetrically arranged. 
- This molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with three identical bridges. 
- It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) due to the symmetric arrangement of the bridges. 
- However, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane, as the structure is not symmetric across such a plane. 
- Thus, this molecule does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has **C₃h symmetry**, as it possesses both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
