Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, actually, the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which makes d = 1/plx.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I need to express N in terms of d, not plx. Let's see. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So, substituting that into the equation N ∝ 1/plx^5 gives N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait a minute. Because 1/plx^5 is equal to (d)^5, since 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Hmm, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance? Or maybe the density of stars as a function of distance. Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, the number would be N per d, which would be d^5 divided by d, which is d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of d.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant. And since plx = 1/d, N = k * (d)^5. Now, if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be N * 4πd² dr (since volume of shell is 4πd² dr, and if stars are uniformly distributed, the number would go with volume). Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. The question says "per unit range of distance, r". Oh, wait, perhaps it's not about the volume but about the surface density or something else.

Wait, the number of stars in a region could be linked to the volume. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is proportional to the volume. Volume in 3D space depends on the radius cubed. But here, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

But the question is about change with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the differential number of stars per unit distance. So if N = k * d^5, then the derivative dN/dd is 5k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. Which would mean that the number of stars increases with the fourth power of d per unit distance. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a particular region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's think about the relation between parallax and distance. Because parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So substituting into N, we get N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That's the number of stars as a function of distance.

Now, the question is how does the number change with distance, per unit range. So perhaps they're asking about the density at a certain distance. For example, how many stars are there per unit distance as you move away. So, the number per unit distance (let's say per parsec) would be N divided by dr. Since N = k d^5, then N/dr = 5k d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. Hence, the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~ r^3 → d^3

B) ~ r^5 → d^5

C) ~ r^4 → d^4

D) ~ r^2 → d^2

So the correct answer should be C.

The question states that the number of stars in a region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the equation, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." To interpret this, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the change in the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4.
\]

This means the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of \( d \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( \sim r^3 \)** corresponds to \( d^3 \), which is incorrect.
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \)** corresponds to \( d^5 \), which represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \)** corresponds to \( d^4 \), which matches the derived result for the change in the number of stars per unit distance.
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \)** corresponds to \( d^2 \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
