Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. In this case, the matrix is a sum of projectors onto the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each multiplied by 1/2. So each state contributes equally.

Wait, I think this might be a mixed state. Because it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2. So ρ represents a classical mixture of two orthogonal states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Oh, wait, perhaps it's about the Bloch sphere representation. I remember that for a single qubit, any state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, it's a vector from the origin to a point on the sphere. But for mixed states, it's like the center of mass of the pure states, scaled by their probabilities.

So, let's think about the Bloch vector. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector r is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formulas I remember are x = ⟨σ_x⟩, y = ⟨σ_y⟩, z = ⟨σ_z⟩. And for a density matrix ρ, these are Tr(ρ σ_x), Tr(ρ σ_y), Tr(ρ σ_z) respectively.

In this case, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each component.

First, |0⟩ is [1; 0], |1⟩ is [0;1]. So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 at (2,2). So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, ρ becomes:

ρ = (1/2) * [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ].

Wait, that's just the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2.

Now, to find the Bloch vector, compute Tr(ρ σ_x), etc.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let's compute each expectation:

Tr(ρ σ_x) = Tr( (I/2) σ_x ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_x) because I is identity, so multiplication just gives σ_x. But σ_x has trace zero. So Tr(ρ σ_x) = 0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ σ_y) = (1/2) Tr(σ_y) = 0, because σ_y's trace is also zero.

Tr(ρ σ_z) = (1/2) Tr(σ_z) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)) )= 0.

Wait, all components x, y, z are zero. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, another way to think about it: the state |0⟩⟨0| is a pure state at (0,0,1) on the Bloch sphere, and |1⟩⟨1| is at (0,0,-1). But when we take the average, each with 50% probability, the Bloch vector would be the average of the two. So (0,0,1) + (0,0,-1) divided by 2, which gives (0,0,0). That's the same conclusion.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a density matrix \(\rho\), the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is computed as:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z),
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. 

For the given \(\rho\), we compute the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

1. \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_x) = 0.
   \]

2. \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_y\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_y) = 0.
   \]

3. \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_z\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_z) = 0.
   \]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. This is consistent with the fact that the state is an equal mixture of \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), resulting in maximal uncertainty.

From the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \((1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \((0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \((0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \((1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C) \((0, 0, 0)\)**.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let's compute each expectation:

Tr(ρ σ_x) = Tr( (I/2) σ_x ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_x) because I is identity, so multiplication just gives σ_x. But σ_x has trace zero. So Tr(ρ σ_x) = 0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ σ_y) = (1/2) Tr(σ_y) = 0, because σ_y's trace is also zero.

Tr(ρ σ_z) = (1/2) Tr(σ_z) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)) )= 0.

Wait, all components x, y, z are zero. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

But when we take the average, each with 50% probability, the Bloch vector would be the average of the two. So (0,0,1) + (0,0,-1) divided by 2, which gives (0,0,0). That's the same conclusion.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a density matrix \(\rho\), the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is computed as:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z),
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. 

For the given \(\rho\), we compute the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

1. \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_x) = 0.
   \]

2. \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_y\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_y) = 0.
   \]

3. \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\):  
   \[
   \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{2} \sigma_z\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_z) = 0.
   \]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. This is consistent with the fact that the state is an equal mixture of \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), resulting in maximal uncertainty.

From the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \((1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \((0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \((0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \((1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C) \((0, 0, 0)\)**.
