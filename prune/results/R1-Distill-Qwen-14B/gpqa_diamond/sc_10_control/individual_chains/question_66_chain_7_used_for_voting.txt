Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each combining different symmetries.

First, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they preserve.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. I think all physical theories should respect Lorentz symmetry because it's fundamental to how spacetime works in relativity. So any operator in SMEFT must transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So symmetry 1 is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they must respect local symmetries. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory, right? The operators are constructed in a way that maintains the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare symmetry. But wait, no, actually, wait. The Standard Model includes both Poincare and gauge symmetries. So SMEFT operators must not break these. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So they have to leave the theory invariant, so all operators must transform correctly under these symmetries.

Wait, but SMEFT is built by writing down all possible operators consistent with the gauge symmetries of the SM, but I'm not sure if Poincare is separate here. Because if the SM includes Poincare, then the SMEFT must also. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. So maybe the question is including Lorentz and Poincare as separate options because they are part of the same symmetry group. But in the options, 1 is Lorentz, 2 is Poincare. So the answer could include both, but I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare is a separate consideration.

Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The SM certainly respects Poincare symmetry. So SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but another thought: in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz and gauge indices. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely required. Poincare symmetry is about the whole isometries of Minkowski spacetime, including translations. But when you add operators, do you have to ensure they don't break translations? Well, the SM already respects translations, so adding operators shouldn't break that. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

So options 1 and 2 are both correct. So looking at the choices, option A is 1 and 2. But wait, let me think about the other options.

CP and CPT symmetries. The Standard Model is known to have some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. So SMEFT, which builds on SM, doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT might violate CP if the SM does. So symmetry 3 (CP) is not necessarily required. So an operator could violate CP, so the correct theory must not require all operators to respect CP.

What about CPT symmetry? The Standard Model respects CPT; I think it's a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory. So any effective theory like SMEFT would have to respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. So any operator in SMEFT must not break CPT symmetry. So symmetry 4 must be respected.

So putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

Wait, wait. No, I think I'm getting confused here. Because Poincare is a larger symmetry than Lorentz. So if SMEFT respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is, when the question says which symmetries must be respected, are both Lorentz and Poincare required, or is Poincare encompassing Lorentz?

Wait, the question is multiple choices, and the options are whether each of the four must be respected. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically included, but the question is about which of the four must be respected. So the answer would include 2 (Poincare) which implies 1 (Lorentz) is also respected. But the options are given as separate points.

Wait, but the options are presented as separate, so 1 and 2 are separate options. So the correct answer would include 1 and 2, and 4, but not 3. Wait, but the options are:

Options:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if I think the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not CP, then the correct option is C (1,2,4). But wait, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare is automatically respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Wait, but Poincare includes translations as well. So do the operators in SMEFT respect translations? Well, the SM respects translations, so the SMEFT, which is an extension, should also. So all operators must be translationally invariant, which is part of Poincare. So operators must respect Poincare.

So the correct answer would be 1, 2, and 4. So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But what about Poincare? Are they including that as a separate symmetry that must be respected?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are required to respect Lorentz, but not necessarily Poincare symmetry. Wait, no, that can't be right because any theory of physics must respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations, which are necessary for momentum conservation.

Wait, but SMEFT is a theory formulated in Minkowski space, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Because all local theories must respect the spacetime symmetries of the spacetime they're formulated on. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations.

So in the question, which ones must be respected? So 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back, I thought the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So all three. So that's options 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but why do I think CPT is required? Because CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, so any operator in the theory must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together, the correct answer would be C) 1,2,4.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, where higher-dimensional operators are added while maintaining the symmetries of the Standard Model. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime, ensuring that physical laws are the same for all observers in inertial frames. Since SMEFT is formulated in Minkowski space, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, symmetry 1 is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built on the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, symmetry 2 is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT does not require all operators to respect CP symmetry. Hence, symmetry 3 is not necessarily correct.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, combining charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, symmetry 4 is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
