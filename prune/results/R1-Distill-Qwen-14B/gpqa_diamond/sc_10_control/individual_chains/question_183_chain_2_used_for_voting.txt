Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The positions are numbered 1 through 6. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, so position 3 has a double bond in the ring, making it cyclohex-3-ene. Then, substituents: at position 2, it's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, it's a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, carbon 2 has a formyl group (so a carbonyl group attached), and carbon 5 has a vinyl group attached.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, no, that's with BH3. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the deoxygenative cleavage of carbonyl groups, like in the Cleve elimination or something similar.

Wait, another reaction I remember is that when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a methylene group. Oh right! It's called the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is another method. Oh wait, perhaps it's the von Braun degradation? Or maybe it's the hydroboration-oxidation... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! That's the hydroxylation reaction. Wait, no, that's when HI adds across a double bond, but with red phosphorus, perhaps it's different. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. So what's the reaction between those groups and red phosphorus with excess HI?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydride attack. Wait, when you have a carbonyl group like formyl, reacting with H-I (like in the presence of a catalyst), maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, the carbonyl is reduced to a methylene group using Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl. But in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, perhaps it's the same type of reaction but with different reagents.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg) to reduce ketones to alkanes, giving alkanes. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2. But wait, in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another reaction: the Staudinger reaction? No, that's with triphenylphosphine and azides. No, not that. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is undergoing a reaction where it's being cleaved.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl. So, the formyl group is an aldehyde, and HI can add to it via nucleophilic addition. The aldehyde would react with HI in a two-step addition, perhaps. But wait, aldehydes can undergo the Cannizzaro reaction when there's no alpha hydrogen, but in this case, the aldehyde is attached to a cyclohexene ring; the alpha position is adjacent to the ring, so maybe it can't form a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into a CH2 group. So the formyl becomes a methylene. Wait, in that case, the product would have a CH2 group instead of the CHO.

But then, what about the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 5? How does that react with red phosphorus and excess HI?

Wait, another thought: maybe the red phosphorus and HI are causing elimination reactions. For example, if there are any double bonds, they might undergo further reactions, but in this case, the starting material already has a cyclohexene ring and a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the formyl group. Let me think about the structure.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 2 (CHO) and at position 5 (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, perhaps? Because the numbering is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and then the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl).

So the structure is: cyclohexene ring with double bond between 3 and 4. Carboxylic acid at 1, formyl at 2, vinyl at 5.

When you react this with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Let me think about each functional group.

First, the formyl group (CHO) could react. In the presence of H-I and red phosphorus, perhaps it's reduced. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2 group. So the CHO becomes CH2.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is attached to the ring. How does HI react with that? Well, with excess HI, perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group would undergo some reaction. Wait, vinyl groups can undergo addition reactions with HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vinyl group is in a position where it can undergo an elimination, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the HI is adding to the double bond.

Wait, but red phosphorus is present. Another reaction I remember is that when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl is converted into a CH2 group. So the formyl group becomes CH2.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would still be present unless something else happens. But wait, perhaps the HI is causing the addition to the double bond in the vinyl group. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) could add HI across its double bond, turning it into CH2-CH2-I. But since it's a vinyl group attached to the ring, maybe when HI adds, it becomes CH2CH2I, but that might not be possible because the structure is attached to a ring.

Wait, but excess HI might lead to more reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the HI is causing some elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but let's think about the overall effect on the molecule. The formyl group (CHO) reduces to CH2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI, perhaps. So, adding HI across the double bond would give a diiodide. But wait, adding HI to a double bond would typically give a vicinal diiodide. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2-I-CH2-I? No, wait, that's not right. The addition of HI to a double bond typically follows anti addition, but in any case, each of the spÂ² carbons would get an iodide. So, the double bond CH2-CH2 would become CH2-I-CH2-I?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: when an alkene reacts with HI, it undergoes an addition reaction. Each of the two carbons in the double bond would get an iodine. So, for a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2-I? Or perhaps CH2-I and the other CH2-I attached to another carbon.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a vinyl group attached to a ring, the addition of HI would form a diiodide. So, the vinyl group becomes a CH2-CH2 diiodide? Or maybe a 1,2-dihalo compound.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would add across the double bond, so each carbon of the double bond would attach an I and a H. So, the structure becomes CH2-I-CH2-I? No, wait, no: when HI adds to a double bond, each H and I add to the same carbon? No, wait, in the addition of HX to alkenes, the H adds to one carbon and X to the other. But for HI, which is a strong acid, the addition is typically via the Markovnikov's rule, but for symmetric alkenes like ethylene, it's not an issue.

Wait, vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so adding HI would add H to one CH2 and I to the adjacent. So perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2I. No, wait, when CH2=CH2 reacts with HI, it becomes CH2-I-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again. For ethylene (CH2=CH2), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH3, but that's not correct because adding H and I across the double bond would make CH2H-CH2I, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual process.

In reality, when an alkene like propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with HI, it adds according to Markovnikov, giving CH2-CH2-I and CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add HI to form CH2-I-CH2CH3? Or is it CH3-I-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no. Wait, no, the correct addition is where the H adds to the less substituted carbon and I to the more substituted. So, for CH2=CH2, adding HI would give CH2-I-CH3. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look this up, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with what I think.

Assuming that the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds HI, but since the starting material has a vinyl group attached to the ring, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and the double bonds in the ring.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) might lead to the elimination of certain groups or the formation of new ones. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is involved. Wait, the compound is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with HI and red phosphorus?

Carboxylic acids can react with HI, perhaps undergoing some kind of acid-base reaction. But I think HI is a strong acid, so maybe the carboxylic acid won't react under these conditions. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and the vinyl group. Let's think again about the reaction with the formyl group. If the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2, then the product would have a CH2 group there. So, the formyl becomes a methylene.

Now, the vinyl group: perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group remains as is, unless something else happens. Or, maybe the vinyl group reacts in some way. But with excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond also undergoes addition, becoming a diiodide.

Wait, but the starting material already has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 3. So, after the reaction, what happens to that double bond?

Wait, the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

When this ring is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the double bond in the ring also reacts. Let me think: in the presence of HI, the ring's double bond could undergo some addition.

Wait, but HI is a strong acid, and red phosphorus is a catalyst for certain reactions. Another possibility is that the ring's double bond is not directly reacting but that the other functional groups are.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde group and the vinyl group, and the cyclohexene ring's double bond might also be affected.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions cause the ring's double bond to undergo a hydride shift or addition.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated from the formula. So perhaps I should calculate the IHD of the starting material and then see how it changes after the reaction.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute for each functional group and the rings present.

Let me compute the IHD of the starting material first.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons and one double bond, so that's one IHD from the ring.

- The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond, so that's another IHD.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another double bond, that's another IHD.

Additionally, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another IHD.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Each ring or each double bond counts as one IHD. So:

Cyclohexene ring: 1 (because of the double bond)

Formyl group (CHO): 1 (the carbonyl)

Vinyl group: 1 (the double bond)

Carboxylic acid (COOH): 1 (the carbonyl)

So in the starting material, that's 1 +1 +1 +1 = 4 IHD.

But wait, wait. The carboxylic acid is a -COOH group, so the structure is O=C-OH. So that's a carbonyl group, so yes, that's another IHD.

So total IHD is 4.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one IHD.

The formyl group is an aldehyde, which is a carbonyl. So that's another IHD.

The vinyl group is an exocyclic double bond, which is another IHD.

The carboxylic acid is a carbonyl, so another IHD. So total of four IHD.

Now, what happens after the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI?

The product's structure would have:

- The formyl group (CHO) converted to CH2. So, the carbonyl is gone, reducing the IHD by 1.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) may react. If it adds HI, the double bond is gone, reducing IHD by 1.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond: if it remains, no change. But if something happens to it, like addition or reduction, that could change IHD.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the dehydrohalogenation or in other elimination reactions, but I'm not sure about the cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, and only the formyl and vinyl groups are modified.

So, let's consider each change.

1. Formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2: That's a reduction, removing a double bond (IHD decreases by 1).

2. Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) reacting with HI: Adding HI across the double bond would eliminate the double bond, so IHD decreases by 1.

3. The cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, so no change.

Additionally, the carboxylic acid group: How does it react? HI may not affect it, but perhaps the reaction conditions could. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but that wouldn't change the IHD.

So, initial IHD is 4. After reaction, the formyl and vinyl groups each lose one IHD (1 each), so total IHD becomes 4 - 2 = 2.

But wait, what about the cyclohexene ring's double bond? If it remains, then the IHD is 2.

Wait, but wait. Let's recount the product's structure.

Product after reaction:

- Cyclohexene ring: same, but I need to check if any reaction affects it.

Wait, if the reaction adds HI across the cyclohexene ring, that could change IHD. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would cause that. The main reaction is on the formyl and vinyl groups.

Wait, but perhaps the vinyl group is on the ring. So when the vinyl group's double bond is added, it becomes a single bond with two iodine atoms attached. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2I, but that's a single bond, so IHD decreases by 1.

Wait, but in the case of the vinyl group attached to the ring, adding HI across the double bond would make it a single bond with two iodines. So the IHD from the vinyl group is gone.

So, after the reaction, the product's IHD would be:

Cyclohexene ring: 1.

Carboxylic acid group: 1 (since it's still a carbonyl).

Formyl group: gone, so no IHD.

Vinyl group: gone, so no IHD.

So IHD is 1 (cyclohexene) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 2.

Wait, but wait. The product has a carboxylic acid group. Let me check what happens to that.

In the presence of red phosphorus and HI, would the carboxylic acid group react? I'm not sure. I don't recall the exact reaction of carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's not reactive under these conditions. So, the carboxylic acid remains, contributing one IHD.

So, starting IHD: 4.

After reaction: cyclohexene (1) + carboxylic acid (1) = 2.

Hmm, but then the options given are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, the options don't include 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial IHD.

Wait, let me recalculate the starting IHD.

Starting compound: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula would be C9H8O3? Let me see: cyclohexene is C6H10, but substituents would change the hydrogen count.

But I'm not here to calculate the formula, but to count IHD.

Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons with one double bond â 1 IHD.

Formyl group: CHO is a carbonyl â 1 IHD.

Vinyl group: CH2=CH- is a double bond â 1 IHD.

Carboxylic acid: COOH is a carbonyl â 1 IHD.

So that's 4 IHD.

After reaction:

Formyl group becomes CH2 â no IHD.

Vinyl group becomes CH2-CH2I (no double bond) â no IHD.

Cyclohexene ring: remains, so 1 IHD.

Carboxylic acid: remains, so 1 IHD.

So, total IHD is 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another possibility: the cyclohexene ring's double bond could be hydrogenated. If the HI and red phosphorus cause the cyclohexene ring's double bond to add hydrogen, then the IHD would decrease by 1.

So, if the ring's double bond is removed, then IHD becomes:

Carboxylic acid (1) + formyl (0) + vinyl (0) + cyclohexene (0) â 1.

So that would bring it to 1 IHD, which is option A.

But why would the cyclohexene ring's double bond react?

Maybe the reaction conditions cause the ring's double bond to add HI. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the presence of HX for such additions.

Wait, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond reacts with HI, adding across it, that would add two I atoms, and the ring would become a single bond. So, the IHD from the ring (1) would be lost.

So, in the product:

- All original double bonds (formyl, vinyl, cyclohexene) are gone.

- The carboxylic acid remains, so one IHD.

So the index would be 1.

That would match option A.

But why would the ring's double bond react? Because the reagent is HI and red phosphorus. HI is a good nucleophile and can add to double bonds. Red phosphorus is sometimes a catalyst for such reactions, like in the addition of HX to alkenes.

So, if the reaction adds HI to all the double bonds, including the cyclohexene ring, then all the double bonds are gone, and the only IHD is from the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: in the product, what happens to the carboxylic acid group? HI is a strong acid. Would it react with the carboxylic acid? Possibly, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction conditions might protonate the carbonyl, but that wouldn't change the IHD.

Hmm, but how would the carboxylic acid group (COOH) react with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is reduced. Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, could the carboxylic acid group be reduced to a CH2 group? Like the formyl group.

In that case, the COOH would become CH2, eliminating the carbonyl group (so IHD decreases by 1).

So, let's recalculate:

Starting IHD: 4.

After reaction:

Formyl: 0.

Vinyl: 0.

Cyclohexene: 0.

Carboxylic acid: 0 (if reduced).

But then, all double bonds are gone. Any rings?

Wait, the ring is a cyclohexane now (no double bond), so no IHD from the ring.

So, the product would have no double bonds, no rings.

But wait, what about any rings in the product? The starting material is a cyclohexene ring. If the double bond is opened, the ring remains a six-membered ring (but single bonds), so the ring itself doesn't contribute to IHD unless there's a double bond or a ring with bonds.

Wait, wait, the ring structure is a cyclohexane (single bonds), so it's a cyclohexane ring. A cyclohexane ring (six-membered ring with single bonds) has 0 IHD because a ring without double bonds or triple bonds doesn't contribute. So, no IHD from the ring.

So, in the product, all IHD comes from any double bonds or rings. If all double bonds are gone, and the ring is a cyclohexane, and the COOH is converted into CH2, then the product has no IHD.

Wait, but if the carboxylic acid is reduced to CH2, that would change the structure. Let me think about the product.

But in the reaction, which groups are affected?

The formyl group is converted to CH2.

The vinyl group's double bond is converted to a single bond, with perhaps addition of HI.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond is converted to a single bond (so cyclohexane).

The carboxylic acid group: if it's reduced, it becomes CH2OH or perhaps CH3. Wait, with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid is deoxygenated to a CH2 group.

Wait, but how?

Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the reaction may reduce the carboxylic acid to a methylene group.

Wait, so carboxylic acid (COOH) would become CH2I.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Maybe the reaction is more selective.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is not reactive under these conditions, so remains as COOH, contributing one IHD.

Wait, but earlier calculation after adding HI to the ring's double bond made the IHD 1.

Let me re-express the scenario:

- Formyl group: CHO â CH2 (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Vinyl group: CH2=CH- â CH2-CH2I (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Cyclohexene ring: CH2=CH â CH2-CH2 (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Carboxylic acid remains, so IHD of 1.

So total IHD is 1.

But wait, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also opened, then the IHD from the ring is gone. So, the product's IHD would be 1 (from COOH) plus any others. But what if the ring's double bond is still present? Then IHD increases.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The product's structure: the formyl group becomes CH2, the vinyl group's double bond is gone (added HI), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is either gone or remains.

If the cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, then IHD is 1 (COOH) + 1 (ring) = 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene ring, only the formyl and vinyl groups.

So, starting IHD is 4.

After reaction: formyl (0), vinyl (0), ring (1), COOH (1) â total IHD = 2.

But options don't have 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into something else. For example, if the COOH is converted into CH2I, then it's a CH2 group, no carbonyl, so no IHD from there.

So, let's see:

Formyl: 0.

Vinyl: 0.

Ring: 1.

COOH: 0.

Total IHD: 1.

That would match option A.

But why would the COOH group be converted?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into an alcohol. But that wouldn't remove the IHD.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, so it remains, leading to IHD of 2, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently.

What if the product is such that all double bonds are gone, and the COOH remains as COOH.

So, IHD would be 1 (COOH) + whatever else.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond is gone, so IHD from the ring is 0.

Then, IHD is 1 (from COOH). That would be option A.

So, if the reaction adds HI to all the double bonds, including the ring, then the IHD would be 1.

But why would the ring's double bond react? Because it's more substituted or more reactive?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring. Then, the IHD would be 1 (ring) + 1 (COOH) = 2.

But since 2 isn't an option, I must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and the ring's double bond are both hydrogenated, leaving only the COOH.

So, IHD is 1, option A.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the overall reaction.

Red phosphorus with HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation of alkenes, but more often, it's used in the addition reactions.

Wait, no, red phosphorus is used in the hydroboration reaction, but that's with BH3. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of HX from alcohols to form alkenes (like in the preparation of alkenes via elimination).

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a hydroxyl group, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is causing the elimination of HX from some position, forming a double bond. But the starting material already has some double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the formyl group and the vinyl group are both reducing agents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction reduces the formyl group and the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration of the double bonds, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus.

I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the possible product structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to CH2, the vinyl group's double bond is opened by adding HI (so becomes CH2CH2I), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also opened (maybe becomes CH2CH2I in the ring).

But wait, the ring's double bond is in the ring, so opening it would require adding HI across the ring, leading to a diiodide. But that might not be possible without breaking the ring, which would require a lot of energy. So perhaps the ring's double bond doesn't react, and only the formyl and vinyl groups do.

So, formyl becomes CH2 (no IHD), vinyl becomes CH2-CH2I (no IHD), cyclohexene's double bond remains (1 IHD), and the COOH group remains (1 IHD).

Total IHD is 2.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial IHD calculation.

Wait, maybe the ring's double bond contributes 1 IHD, the formyl group 1, the vinyl group 1, and the COOH 1, totaling 4.

After reaction, formyl and vinyl are gone, so 4 - 2 = 2. Add the ring (1), COOH (1): 2 + 2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's formula is C9H8O3.

Molecular formula:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

But substituents: CHO (adds one C, one O), vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- (adds two C and two H?), and the COOH (COOH is O2).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the formula.

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

At position 2: CHO â adds C, H, O.

At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH-) â adds two C and two H.

At position 1: COOH â adds two O, one C, two O, and two H? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

The main ring is C6H8 (since it's cyclohexene, which is C6H10 but with one double bond â 2n +2: n=6 â 14 H. Wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. But with substituents, maybe the formula is adjusted.

But perhaps I should proceed without the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc.

So starting material:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene) â 1.

- formyl group: 1 double bond (CHO) â 1.

- vinyl group: 1 double bond â 1.

- COOH: 1 double bond â 1.

Total: 4.

After reaction:

- formyl group â CH2 (no double bond) â 0.

- vinyl group â CH2-CH2I (no double bond) â 0.

- cyclohexene ring â if the double bond is gone â 0.

- COOH â remains â 1.

So, IHD is 1.

But if the cyclohexene's double bond remains, then IHD is 2.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are such that all double bonds are being attacked, so perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is also opened, leading to IHD of 1.

So, the IHD of the product is 1.

So the correct answer is A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound in question, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond (contributes 1 IHD).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: A carbonyl group (contributes 1 IHD).
3. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH-)**: A double bond (contributes 1 IHD).
4. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)**: A carbonyl group (contributes 1 IHD).

Thus, the total index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the starting material is **4**.

When the compound is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl group is reduced to a methylene group (CH2), eliminating one IHD.
2. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH-)**: The double bond undergoes addition of HI, converting it into a single bond (CH2-CH2I), eliminating one IHD.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring may also react with HI, converting it into a single bond (cyclohexane), eliminating one IHD.

The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected under these reaction conditions, contributing 1 IHD to the product.

After the reaction, the product has:

- **Cyclohexane ring**: No IHD (single bond).
- **Formyl group**: Converted to CH2 (no IHD).
- **Vinyl group**: Converted to CH2-CH2I (no IHD).
- **Carboxylic acid**: Remains as COOH (contributes 1 IHD).

Thus, the total IHD of the product is **1**.

The correct answer is **A) 1**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The positions are numbered 1 through 6. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, so position 3 has a double bond in the ring, making it cyclohex-3-ene. Then, substituents: at position 2, it's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, it's a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, carbon 2 has a formyl group (so a carbonyl group attached), and carbon 5 has a vinyl group attached.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, no, that's with BH3. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the deoxygenative cleavage of carbonyl groups, like in the Cleve elimination or something similar.

Wait, another reaction I remember is that when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a methylene group. Oh right! It's called the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is another method. Oh wait, perhaps it's the von Braun degradation? Or maybe it's the hydroboration-oxidation... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! That's the hydroxylation reaction. Wait, no, that's when HI adds across a double bond, but with red phosphorus, perhaps it's different. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. So what's the reaction between those groups and red phosphorus with excess HI?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydride attack. Wait, when you have a carbonyl group like formyl, reacting with H-I (like in the presence of a catalyst), maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, the carbonyl is reduced to a methylene group using Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl. But in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, perhaps it's the same type of reaction but with different reagents.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg) to reduce ketones to alkanes, giving alkanes. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2. But wait, in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another reaction: the Staudinger reaction? No, that's with triphenylphosphine and azides. No, not that. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is undergoing a reaction where it's being cleaved.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl. So, the formyl group is an aldehyde, and HI can add to it via nucleophilic addition. The aldehyde would react with HI in a two-step addition, perhaps. But wait, aldehydes can undergo the Cannizzaro reaction when there's no alpha hydrogen, but in this case, the aldehyde is attached to a cyclohexene ring; the alpha position is adjacent to the ring, so maybe it can't form a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into a CH2 group. So the formyl becomes a methylene. Wait, in that case, the product would have a CH2 group instead of the CHO.

But then, what about the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 5? How does that react with red phosphorus and excess HI?

Wait, another thought: maybe the red phosphorus and HI are causing elimination reactions. For example, if there are any double bonds, they might undergo further reactions, but in this case, the starting material already has a cyclohexene ring and a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the formyl group. Let me think about the structure.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 2 (CHO) and at position 5 (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, perhaps? Because the numbering is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and then the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl).

So the structure is: cyclohexene ring with double bond between 3 and 4. Carboxylic acid at 1, formyl at 2, vinyl at 5.

When you react this with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Let me think about each functional group.

First, the formyl group (CHO) could react. In the presence of H-I and red phosphorus, perhaps it's reduced. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2 group. So the CHO becomes CH2.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is attached to the ring. How does HI react with that? Well, with excess HI, perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group would undergo some reaction. Wait, vinyl groups can undergo addition reactions with HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vinyl group is in a position where it can undergo an elimination, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the HI is adding to the double bond.

Wait, but red phosphorus is present. Another reaction I remember is that when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl is converted into a CH2 group. So the formyl group becomes CH2.

Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would still be present unless something else happens. But wait, perhaps the HI is causing the addition to the double bond in the vinyl group. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) could add HI across its double bond, turning it into CH2-CH2-I. But since it's a vinyl group attached to the ring, maybe when HI adds, it becomes CH2CH2I, but that might not be possible because the structure is attached to a ring.

Wait, but excess HI might lead to more reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the HI is causing some elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but let's think about the overall effect on the molecule. The formyl group (CHO) reduces to CH2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI, perhaps. So, adding HI across the double bond would give a diiodide. But wait, adding HI to a double bond would typically give a vicinal diiodide. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2-I-CH2-I? No, wait, that's not right. The addition of HI to a double bond typically follows anti addition, but in any case, each of the spÂ² carbons would get an iodide. So, the double bond CH2-CH2 would become CH2-I-CH2-I?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: when an alkene reacts with HI, it undergoes an addition reaction. Each of the two carbons in the double bond would get an iodine. So, for a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2-I? Or perhaps CH2-I and the other CH2-I attached to another carbon.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a vinyl group attached to a ring, the addition of HI would form a diiodide. So, the vinyl group becomes a CH2-CH2 diiodide? Or maybe a 1,2-dihalo compound.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would add across the double bond, so each carbon of the double bond would attach an I and a H. So, the structure becomes CH2-I-CH2-I? No, wait, no: when HI adds to a double bond, each H and I add to the same carbon? No, wait, in the addition of HX to alkenes, the H adds to one carbon and X to the other. But for HI, which is a strong acid, the addition is typically via the Markovnikov's rule, but for symmetric alkenes like ethylene, it's not an issue.

Wait, vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so adding HI would add H to one CH2 and I to the adjacent. So perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2I. No, wait, when CH2=CH2 reacts with HI, it becomes CH2-I-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again. For ethylene (CH2=CH2), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH3, but that's not correct because adding H and I across the double bond would make CH2H-CH2I, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual process.

In reality, when an alkene like propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with HI, it adds according to Markovnikov, giving CH2-CH2-I and CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add HI to form CH2-I-CH2CH3? Or is it CH3-I-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no. Wait, no, the correct addition is where the H adds to the less substituted carbon and I to the more substituted. So, for CH2=CH2, adding HI would give CH2-I-CH3. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look this up, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with what I think.

Assuming that the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds HI, but since the starting material has a vinyl group attached to the ring, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and the double bonds in the ring.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) might lead to the elimination of certain groups or the formation of new ones. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is involved. Wait, the compound is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with HI and red phosphorus?

Carboxylic acids can react with HI, perhaps undergoing some kind of acid-base reaction. But I think HI is a strong acid, so maybe the carboxylic acid won't react under these conditions. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and the vinyl group. Let's think again about the reaction with the formyl group. If the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2, then the product would have a CH2 group there. So, the formyl becomes a methylene.

Now, the vinyl group: perhaps the double bond in the vinyl group remains as is, unless something else happens. Or, maybe the vinyl group reacts in some way. But with excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond also undergoes addition, becoming a diiodide.

Wait, but the starting material already has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 3. So, after the reaction, what happens to that double bond?

Wait, the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

When this ring is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the double bond in the ring also reacts. Let me think: in the presence of HI, the ring's double bond could undergo some addition.

Wait, but HI is a strong acid, and red phosphorus is a catalyst for certain reactions. Another possibility is that the ring's double bond is not directly reacting but that the other functional groups are.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde group and the vinyl group, and the cyclohexene ring's double bond might also be affected.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions cause the ring's double bond to undergo a hydride shift or addition.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated from the formula. So perhaps I should calculate the IHD of the starting material and then see how it changes after the reaction.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute for each functional group and the rings present.

Let me compute the IHD of the starting material first.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons and one double bond, so that's one IHD from the ring.

- The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond, so that's another IHD.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another double bond, that's another IHD.

Additionally, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another IHD.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Each ring or each double bond counts as one IHD. So:

Cyclohexene ring: 1 (because of the double bond)

Formyl group (CHO): 1 (the carbonyl)

Vinyl group: 1 (the double bond)

Carboxylic acid (COOH): 1 (the carbonyl)

So in the starting material, that's 1 +1 +1 +1 = 4 IHD.

But wait, wait. The carboxylic acid is a -COOH group, so the structure is O=C-OH. So that's a carbonyl group, so yes, that's another IHD.

So total IHD is 4.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one IHD.

The formyl group is an aldehyde, which is a carbonyl. So that's another IHD.

The vinyl group is an exocyclic double bond, which is another IHD.

The carboxylic acid is a carbonyl, so another IHD. So total of four IHD.

Now, what happens after the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI?

The product's structure would have:

- The formyl group (CHO) converted to CH2. So, the carbonyl is gone, reducing the IHD by 1.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) may react. If it adds HI, the double bond is gone, reducing IHD by 1.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond: if it remains, no change. But if something happens to it, like addition or reduction, that could change IHD.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the dehydrohalogenation or in other elimination reactions, but I'm not sure about the cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, and only the formyl and vinyl groups are modified.

So, let's consider each change.

1. Formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2: That's a reduction, removing a double bond (IHD decreases by 1).

2. Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) reacting with HI: Adding HI across the double bond would eliminate the double bond, so IHD decreases by 1.

3. The cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, so no change.

Additionally, the carboxylic acid group: How does it react? HI may not affect it, but perhaps the reaction conditions could. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but that wouldn't change the IHD.

So, initial IHD is 4. After reaction, the formyl and vinyl groups each lose one IHD (1 each), so total IHD becomes 4 - 2 = 2.

But wait, what about the cyclohexene ring's double bond? If it remains, then the IHD is 2.

Wait, but wait. Let's recount the product's structure.

Product after reaction:

- Cyclohexene ring: same, but I need to check if any reaction affects it.

Wait, if the reaction adds HI across the cyclohexene ring, that could change IHD. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would cause that. The main reaction is on the formyl and vinyl groups.

Wait, but perhaps the vinyl group is on the ring. So when the vinyl group's double bond is added, it becomes a single bond with two iodine atoms attached. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2I, but that's a single bond, so IHD decreases by 1.

Wait, but in the case of the vinyl group attached to the ring, adding HI across the double bond would make it a single bond with two iodines. So the IHD from the vinyl group is gone.

So, after the reaction, the product's IHD would be:

Cyclohexene ring: 1.

Carboxylic acid group: 1 (since it's still a carbonyl).

Formyl group: gone, so no IHD.

Vinyl group: gone, so no IHD.

So IHD is 1 (cyclohexene) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 2.

Wait, but wait. The product has a carboxylic acid group. Let me check what happens to that.

In the presence of red phosphorus and HI, would the carboxylic acid group react? I'm not sure. I don't recall the exact reaction of carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's not reactive under these conditions. So, the carboxylic acid remains, contributing one IHD.

So, starting IHD: 4.

After reaction: cyclohexene (1) + carboxylic acid (1) = 2.

Hmm, but then the options given are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, the options don't include 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial IHD.

Wait, let me recalculate the starting IHD.

Starting compound: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula would be C9H8O3? Let me see: cyclohexene is C6H10, but substituents would change the hydrogen count.

But I'm not here to calculate the formula, but to count IHD.

Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons with one double bond â 1 IHD.

Formyl group: CHO is a carbonyl â 1 IHD.

Vinyl group: CH2=CH- is a double bond â 1 IHD.

Carboxylic acid: COOH is a carbonyl â 1 IHD.

So that's 4 IHD.

After reaction:

Formyl group becomes CH2 â no IHD.

Vinyl group becomes CH2-CH2I (no double bond) â no IHD.

Cyclohexene ring: remains, so 1 IHD.

Carboxylic acid: remains, so 1 IHD.

So, total IHD is 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another possibility: the cyclohexene ring's double bond could be hydrogenated. If the HI and red phosphorus cause the cyclohexene ring's double bond to add hydrogen, then the IHD would decrease by 1.

So, if the ring's double bond is removed, then IHD becomes:

Carboxylic acid (1) + formyl (0) + vinyl (0) + cyclohexene (0) â 1.

So that would bring it to 1 IHD, which is option A.

But why would the cyclohexene ring's double bond react?

Maybe the reaction conditions cause the ring's double bond to add HI. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the presence of HX for such additions.

Wait, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond reacts with HI, adding across it, that would add two I atoms, and the ring would become a single bond. So, the IHD from the ring (1) would be lost.

So, in the product:

- All original double bonds (formyl, vinyl, cyclohexene) are gone.

- The carboxylic acid remains, so one IHD.

So the index would be 1.

That would match option A.

But why would the ring's double bond react? Because the reagent is HI and red phosphorus. HI is a good nucleophile and can add to double bonds. Red phosphorus is sometimes a catalyst for such reactions, like in the addition of HX to alkenes.

So, if the reaction adds HI to all the double bonds, including the cyclohexene ring, then all the double bonds are gone, and the only IHD is from the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: in the product, what happens to the carboxylic acid group? HI is a strong acid. Would it react with the carboxylic acid? Possibly, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction conditions might protonate the carbonyl, but that wouldn't change the IHD.

Hmm, but how would the carboxylic acid group (COOH) react with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is reduced. Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, could the carboxylic acid group be reduced to a CH2 group? Like the formyl group.

In that case, the COOH would become CH2, eliminating the carbonyl group (so IHD decreases by 1).

So, let's recalculate:

Starting IHD: 4.

After reaction:

Formyl: 0.

Vinyl: 0.

Cyclohexene: 0.

Carboxylic acid: 0 (if reduced).

But then, all double bonds are gone. Any rings?

Wait, the ring is a cyclohexane now (no double bond), so no IHD from the ring.

So, the product would have no double bonds, no rings.

But wait, what about any rings in the product? The starting material is a cyclohexene ring. If the double bond is opened, the ring remains a six-membered ring (but single bonds), so the ring itself doesn't contribute to IHD unless there's a double bond or a ring with bonds.

Wait, wait, the ring structure is a cyclohexane (single bonds), so it's a cyclohexane ring. A cyclohexane ring (six-membered ring with single bonds) has 0 IHD because a ring without double bonds or triple bonds doesn't contribute. So, no IHD from the ring.

So, in the product, all IHD comes from any double bonds or rings. If all double bonds are gone, and the ring is a cyclohexane, and the COOH is converted into CH2, then the product has no IHD.

Wait, but if the carboxylic acid is reduced to CH2, that would change the structure. Let me think about the product.

But in the reaction, which groups are affected?

The formyl group is converted to CH2.

The vinyl group's double bond is converted to a single bond, with perhaps addition of HI.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond is converted to a single bond (so cyclohexane).

The carboxylic acid group: if it's reduced, it becomes CH2OH or perhaps CH3. Wait, with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid is deoxygenated to a CH2 group.

Wait, but how?

Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the reaction may reduce the carboxylic acid to a methylene group.

Wait, so carboxylic acid (COOH) would become CH2I.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Maybe the reaction is more selective.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is not reactive under these conditions, so remains as COOH, contributing one IHD.

Wait, but earlier calculation after adding HI to the ring's double bond made the IHD 1.

Let me re-express the scenario:

- Formyl group: CHO â CH2 (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Vinyl group: CH2=CH- â CH2-CH2I (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Cyclohexene ring: CH2=CH â CH2-CH2 (IHD decreases by 1 â from 1 to 0).

- Carboxylic acid remains, so IHD of 1.

So total IHD is 1.

But wait, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also opened, then the IHD from the ring is gone. So, the product's IHD would be 1 (from COOH) plus any others. But what if the ring's double bond is still present? Then IHD increases.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The product's structure: the formyl group becomes CH2, the vinyl group's double bond is gone (added HI), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is either gone or remains.

If the cyclohexene ring's double bond remains, then IHD is 1 (COOH) + 1 (ring) = 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene ring, only the formyl and vinyl groups.

So, starting IHD is 4.

After reaction: formyl (0), vinyl (0), ring (1), COOH (1) â total IHD = 2.

But options don't have 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into something else. For example, if the COOH is converted into CH2I, then it's a CH2 group, no carbonyl, so no IHD from there.

So, let's see:

Formyl: 0.

Vinyl: 0.

Ring: 1.

COOH: 0.

Total IHD: 1.

That would match option A.

But why would the COOH group be converted?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into an alcohol. But that wouldn't remove the IHD.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, so it remains, leading to IHD of 2, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently.

What if the product is such that all double bonds are gone, and the COOH remains as COOH.

So, IHD would be 1 (COOH) + whatever else.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond is gone, so IHD from the ring is 0.

Then, IHD is 1 (from COOH). That would be option A.

So, if the reaction adds HI to all the double bonds, including the ring, then the IHD would be 1.

But why would the ring's double bond react? Because it's more substituted or more reactive?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring. Then, the IHD would be 1 (ring) + 1 (COOH) = 2.

But since 2 isn't an option, I must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and the ring's double bond are both hydrogenated, leaving only the COOH.

So, IHD is 1, option A.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the overall reaction.

Red phosphorus with HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation of alkenes, but more often, it's used in the addition reactions.

Wait, no, red phosphorus is used in the hydroboration reaction, but that's with BH3. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of HX from alcohols to form alkenes (like in the preparation of alkenes via elimination).

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a hydroxyl group, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is causing the elimination of HX from some position, forming a double bond. But the starting material already has some double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the formyl group and the vinyl group are both reducing agents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction reduces the formyl group and the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration of the double bonds, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus.

I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the possible product structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to CH2, the vinyl group's double bond is opened by adding HI (so becomes CH2CH2I), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also opened (maybe becomes CH2CH2I in the ring).

But wait, the ring's double bond is in the ring, so opening it would require adding HI across the ring, leading to a diiodide. But that might not be possible without breaking the ring, which would require a lot of energy. So perhaps the ring's double bond doesn't react, and only the formyl and vinyl groups do.

So, formyl becomes CH2 (no IHD), vinyl becomes CH2-CH2I (no IHD), cyclohexene's double bond remains (1 IHD), and the COOH group remains (1 IHD).

Total IHD is 2.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial IHD calculation.

Wait, maybe the ring's double bond contributes 1 IHD, the formyl group 1, the vinyl group 1, and the COOH 1, totaling 4.

After reaction, formyl and vinyl are gone, so 4 - 2 = 2. Add the ring (1), COOH (1): 2 + 2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's formula is C9H8O3.

Molecular formula:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

But substituents: CHO (adds one C, one O), vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- (adds two C and two H?), and the COOH (COOH is O2).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the formula.

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

At position 2: CHO â adds C, H, O.

At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH-) â adds two C and two H.

At position 1: COOH â adds two O, one C, two O, and two H? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

The main ring is C6H8 (since it's cyclohexene, which is C6H10 but with one double bond â 2n +2: n=6 â 14 H. Wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. But with substituents, maybe the formula is adjusted.

But perhaps I should proceed without the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc.

So starting material:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene) â 1.

- formyl group: 1 double bond (CHO) â 1.

- vinyl group: 1 double bond â 1.

- COOH: 1 double bond â 1.

Total: 4.

After reaction:

- formyl group â CH2 (no double bond) â 0.

- vinyl group â CH2-CH2I (no double bond) â 0.

- cyclohexene ring â if the double bond is gone â 0.

- COOH â remains â 1.

So, IHD is 1.

But if the cyclohexene's double bond remains, then IHD is 2.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are such that all double bonds are being attacked, so perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is also opened, leading to IHD of 1.

So, the IHD of the product is 1.

So the correct answer is A) 1.


The compound in question, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond (contributes 1 IHD).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: A carbonyl group (contributes 1 IHD).
3. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH-)**: A double bond (contributes 1 IHD).
4. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)**: A carbonyl group (contributes 1 IHD).

Thus, the total index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the starting material is **4**.

When the compound is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl group is reduced to a methylene group (CH2), eliminating one IHD.
2. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH-)**: The double bond undergoes addition of HI, converting it into a single bond (CH2-CH2I), eliminating one IHD.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring may also react with HI, converting it into a single bond (cyclohexane), eliminating one IHD.

The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected under these reaction conditions, contributing 1 IHD to the product.

After the reaction, the product has:

- **Cyclohexane ring**: No IHD (single bond).
- **Formyl group**: Converted to CH2 (no IHD).
- **Vinyl group**: Converted to CH2-CH2I (no IHD).
- **Carboxylic acid**: Remains as COOH (contributes 1 IHD).

Thus, the total IHD of the product is **1**.

The correct answer is **A) 1**.
