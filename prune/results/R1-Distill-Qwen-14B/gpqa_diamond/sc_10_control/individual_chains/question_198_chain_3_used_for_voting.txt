Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think the first thing I need to recall is what these stability constants represent. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β value, the more stable the complex.

Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe Co(SCN)n where n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63 (the highest), and β4 is 16. Wait, wait, that's interesting because β4 is lower than β3. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions attached.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. So that would be the complex with n=2, which is β2=40.

The problem is asking for the percentage of this particular species (n=2) among all the Co species. So I need to find the fraction of Co that's in the [Co(SCN)_2]^x+ form.

I remember that to calculate the fraction of each species, we use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their contributions, but that might get complicated with four complexes. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the dominant species based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Wait, the solution also has SCN- at 0.1 M. The total Co concentration is 0.01 M. So, the ligand is present in higher concentration than the metal. That might mean that higher-order complexes are more likely, but the stability constants matter too.

I think the way to proceed is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=0 to n=4) using the formula for the distribution of metal complexes. But maybe for this problem, since the question is only about the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), I can find its fraction relative to the others.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant and the appropriate power of the ligand concentration, all divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (Σ (β_k * [SCN-]^k) for k=0 to 4)

But wait, the β constants are for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, right? Wait, the β is the formation constant for the complex. So for each n, the fraction of Co in that complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) divided by the sum over all n of (β_n [SCN]^n) for each possible complex.

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these fractions multiplied by the total concentration. Because each complex has one Co ion.

Wait, the metal's total concentration is c = [Co]_total = sum_{n} [Co(SCN)_n] = sum_{n} (β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+ initial]) ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the initial [Co^2+] is the free ion, which is [Co^2+]_free. But in the presence of ligand, the metal forms complexes. So the total cobalt is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion. But the way stability constants work, the formation of the complexes shifts the free metal concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] (free) + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^3+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^4+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^5+.

But to relate all these, we can use the stability constants. Let me think: the stability constant β_n is defined as [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ). So, [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The sum of all these complexes plus the free Co^2+ equals the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M. So:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 = c = 0.01 M.

Factor out [Co^2+], we get:

[Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c.

So [Co^2+] = c / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ by multiplying β_n [SCN]^n by [Co^2+].

The fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / c, since c is the total Co concentration.

Wait, but wait. Because [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+], and when you divide by c, which is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ plus [Co^2+], but that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the distribution as:

The fraction of each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum over k (β_k [SCN]^k) )

Because the sum of all the fractions would be the sum of (β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+]) / [Co^2+] (sum terms) = sum (β_n [SCN]^n) / sum (β_k [SCN]^k) ) = 1.

Wait, but then if that's the case, then the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, [Co^2+] is present as a free ion, which is when n=0. So for n=0, the term would just be 1 (since β0 would be 1, but I'm not sure if that's how it's considered. Hmm, perhaps not. Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+.

Wait, I think the proper way to handle this is to include the free Co^2+ as a term with n=0, with β0 =1, since β is the formation constant for the complex. So for n=0, β0 is 1, and [Co^2+] is β0 [Co^2+][SCN]^0 = [Co^2+].

So the fraction f_n for each n is (βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

But wait, wait, the problem is that the stability constants are given for β1 to β4, which suggests that β0 is 1 (the free ion). So the numerator for each fraction is β_n [SCN]^n, and the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 β_n [SCN]^n. But wait, β0 is 1, so the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So the fraction of each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the problem is that the problem gives the βn for n=1 to 4, but not β0. So β0 is considered as 1, yes.

So let's proceed. The SCN concentration is 0.1 M. Let me compute each term in the denominator and numerator.

First, compute each term:

n=0: term is β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So denominator sum is:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = Let's compute:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that:

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's see.

2.3646 goes into 0.4 about 0.169 times. Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4, so yeah, approximately 0.169.

Wait, but 0.4 /2.3646 = let's do it more accurately.

2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So the fraction for n=2 is approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's 16.9%, which is option D. Hmm.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would match this. But wait, let me think again. Because the denominator is sum of all terms, which includes the free ion, which is n=0, which is 1. So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ~0.169, which is 16.9%. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, wait, but I thought the [Co(SCN)_3]^4+ would have a higher β, so maybe it's more, but the denominator is considering all terms, including lower n.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when the ligand concentration is much higher, the higher n species are more dominant. But let's check the denominator.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

Compute each term:

n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So sum is 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 = approx 0.169, so 16.9%.

But then, the options include option D as 16.9%.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^3+.

Wait, but perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the n values. Because sometimes, the complex [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ is the one that's blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complex, which implies two SCN- ions, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for complexes with different charges, but that shouldn't affect the fractions. The β is about the log of the formation constant, so it's a ratio regardless.

So according to my calculations, the fraction is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So option D is 16.9%, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because if the sum is 2.3646, the n=2 term is 0.4. 0.4/2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9% (option D). So that's the answer.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in stability constants, the β is given as log beta, so perhaps I should compute log terms. Wait, no, the question states the stability constants β1=9, etc. So I think I didn't make a mistake there.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the dominant species approach. With [SCN-] =0.1 M, which is relatively high, but not extremely high. Let's see the ratios of the terms.

The denominator sum is 2.3646, which is dominated by the n=0 (1), n=1 (0.9), and n=2 (0.4) terms. The higher n terms (n=3 and n=4) are much smaller, contributing 0.063 and 0.0016.

So, the largest term is n=0 (1) and n=1 (0.9), followed by n=2 (0.4).

So the dominant species are the free ion, the monodentate complex, and the dithiocyanato complex.

So the fraction for n=2 is indeed about 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]³⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) provided and the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. The stability constants are:

- β₁ = 9 (n = 1)
- β₂ = 40 (n = 2)
- β₃ = 63 (n = 3)
- β₄ = 16 (n = 4)

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, the free cobalt ion corresponds to \(n = 0\), with \(\beta_0 = 1\). The denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k\) for \(k = 0\) to \(k = 4\).

### Step 1: Compute each term in the denominator
- For \(n = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- For \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- For \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- For \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- For \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of these terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for \(n = 2\)
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\(n = 2\)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think the first thing I need to recall is what these stability constants represent. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β value, the more stable the complex.

Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe Co(SCN)n where n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63 (the highest), and β4 is 16. Wait, wait, that's interesting because β4 is lower than β3. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions attached.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. So that would be the complex with n=2, which is β2=40.

The problem is asking for the percentage of this particular species (n=2) among all the Co species. So I need to find the fraction of Co that's in the [Co(SCN)_2]^x+ form.

I remember that to calculate the fraction of each species, we use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their contributions, but that might get complicated with four complexes. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the dominant species based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Wait, the solution also has SCN- at 0.1 M. The total Co concentration is 0.01 M. So, the ligand is present in higher concentration than the metal. That might mean that higher-order complexes are more likely, but the stability constants matter too.

I think the way to proceed is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=0 to n=4) using the formula for the distribution of metal complexes. But maybe for this problem, since the question is only about the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), I can find its fraction relative to the others.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant and the appropriate power of the ligand concentration, all divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (Σ (β_k * [SCN-]^k) for k=0 to 4)

But wait, the β constants are for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, right? Wait, the β is the formation constant for the complex. So for each n, the fraction of Co in that complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) divided by the sum over all n of (β_n [SCN]^n) for each possible complex.

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these fractions multiplied by the total concentration. Because each complex has one Co ion.

Wait, the metal's total concentration is c = [Co]_total = sum_{n} [Co(SCN)_n] = sum_{n} (β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+ initial]) ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the initial [Co^2+] is the free ion, which is [Co^2+]_free. But in the presence of ligand, the metal forms complexes. So the total cobalt is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion. But the way stability constants work, the formation of the complexes shifts the free metal concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] (free) + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^3+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^4+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^5+.

But to relate all these, we can use the stability constants. Let me think: the stability constant β_n is defined as [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ). So, [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The sum of all these complexes plus the free Co^2+ equals the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M. So:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 = c = 0.01 M.

Factor out [Co^2+], we get:

[Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c.

So [Co^2+] = c / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ by multiplying β_n [SCN]^n by [Co^2+].

The fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / c, since c is the total Co concentration.

Wait, but wait. Because [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+], and when you divide by c, which is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ plus [Co^2+], but that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the distribution as:

The fraction of each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum over k (β_k [SCN]^k) )

Because the sum of all the fractions would be the sum of (β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+]) / [Co^2+] (sum terms) = sum (β_n [SCN]^n) / sum (β_k [SCN]^k) ) = 1.

Wait, but then if that's the case, then the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, [Co^2+] is present as a free ion, which is when n=0. So for n=0, the term would just be 1 (since β0 would be 1, but I'm not sure if that's how it's considered. Hmm, perhaps not. Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+.

Wait, I think the proper way to handle this is to include the free Co^2+ as a term with n=0, with β0 =1, since β is the formation constant for the complex. So for n=0, β0 is 1, and [Co^2+] is β0 [Co^2+][SCN]^0 = [Co^2+].

So the fraction f_n for each n is (βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

But wait, wait, the problem is that the stability constants are given for β1 to β4, which suggests that β0 is 1 (the free ion). So the numerator for each fraction is β_n [SCN]^n, and the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 β_n [SCN]^n. But wait, β0 is 1, so the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So the fraction of each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the problem is that the problem gives the βn for n=1 to 4, but not β0. So β0 is considered as 1, yes.

So let's proceed. The SCN concentration is 0.1 M. Let me compute each term in the denominator and numerator.

First, compute each term:

n=0: term is β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So denominator sum is:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = Let's compute:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that:

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's see.

2.3646 goes into 0.4 about 0.169 times. Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4, so yeah, approximately 0.169.

Wait, but 0.4 /2.3646 = let's do it more accurately.

2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So the fraction for n=2 is approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's 16.9%, which is option D. Hmm.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would match this. But wait, let me think again. Because the denominator is sum of all terms, which includes the free ion, which is n=0, which is 1. So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ~0.169, which is 16.9%. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, wait, but I thought the [Co(SCN)_3]^4+ would have a higher β, so maybe it's more, but the denominator is considering all terms, including lower n.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when the ligand concentration is much higher, the higher n species are more dominant. But let's check the denominator.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

Compute each term:

n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So sum is 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 = approx 0.169, so 16.9%.

But then, the options include option D as 16.9%.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^3+.

Wait, but perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the n values. Because sometimes, the complex [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ is the one that's blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complex, which implies two SCN- ions, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for complexes with different charges, but that shouldn't affect the fractions. The β is about the log of the formation constant, so it's a ratio regardless.

So according to my calculations, the fraction is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So option D is 16.9%, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because if the sum is 2.3646, the n=2 term is 0.4. 0.4/2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9% (option D). So that's the answer.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in stability constants, the β is given as log beta, so perhaps I should compute log terms. Wait, no, the question states the stability constants β1=9, etc. So I think I didn't make a mistake there.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the dominant species approach. With [SCN-] =0.1 M, which is relatively high, but not extremely high. Let's see the ratios of the terms.

The denominator sum is 2.3646, which is dominated by the n=0 (1), n=1 (0.9), and n=2 (0.4) terms. The higher n terms (n=3 and n=4) are much smaller, contributing 0.063 and 0.0016.

So, the largest term is n=0 (1) and n=1 (0.9), followed by n=2 (0.4).

So the dominant species are the free ion, the monodentate complex, and the dithiocyanato complex.

So the fraction for n=2 is indeed about 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]³⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) provided and the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. The stability constants are:

- β₁ = 9 (n = 1)
- β₂ = 40 (n = 2)
- β₃ = 63 (n = 3)
- β₄ = 16 (n = 4)

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, the free cobalt ion corresponds to \(n = 0\), with \(\beta_0 = 1\). The denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k\) for \(k = 0\) to \(k = 4\).

### Step 1: Compute each term in the denominator
- For \(n = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- For \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- For \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- For \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- For \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of these terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for \(n = 2\)
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\(n = 2\)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
