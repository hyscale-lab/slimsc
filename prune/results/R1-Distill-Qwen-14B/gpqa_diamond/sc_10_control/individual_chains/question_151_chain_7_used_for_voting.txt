Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the state of the system is a vector. So to find the probability, I probably need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors or something like that.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). So that's a column vector with three components. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The matrix P has elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0,1/sqrt(2), 0. So I should write that down. Let me visualize it:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I think the first step is to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues. The question asks for the probability of getting 0 as the result. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the probability.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues? Oh right, I need to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set that up.

So, compute the determinant of (P - λI). The matrix P - λI would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step. The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (the third term is zero because the first element is zero)

Wait, no, maybe I should expand along the first row since the third element is zero, which might simplify calculations.

Expanding along the first row:

det = (-λ) * det of the minor matrix obtained by removing first row and column.

The minor is:
[
[-λ, 1/√2],
[1/√2, -λ]
]

So the determinant of this minor is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Then, the next term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times the determinant of the minor for the (1,2) element.

Minor for (1,2) is:
[
[1/√2, 1/√2],
[0, -λ]
]

Wait, no, wait. The minor for (1,2) is the matrix you get by removing row 1 and column 2. So it's:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So the minor is:
Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2).

But remember, it's multiplied by (1/√2) and (-1)^(1+2) which is -1.

So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)*(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

The third term in the expansion is 0, so we can ignore it.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (-λ) multiplied by (λ² - 1/2), the second term is (1/√2)*(-1)^(1+2) * [determinant of minor], which is (1/√2)*(-1)*(-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

Wait, but the sign for the second term in expansion is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the coefficient for the (1,2) term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1) * [determinant].

So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) )= (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

So the determinant is:

det = (-λ)(λ² - (1/2)) + (λ/2) = ?

Wait, no. The determinant is the sum of all these terms. The first term is (-λ) multiplied by (λ² - 1/2), the second term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times the minor determinant. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully. The determinant expansion along the first row is:

det = (-λ) * M11 + (1/√2) * (-1)^{1+2} * M12 + 0 * M13

Where M11 is the minor for (1,1), which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ [-λ, 1/√2],
  [1/√2, -λ] ]

Which is λ² - (1/2).

M12 is the minor for (1,2), which is the determinant of the matrix:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
  [0, -λ] ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2) * (-1)^3 * (-λ/√2) )

Simplify the exponents: (-1)^3 is -1. So:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2)
= (-λ^3 + (λ)/2) ) + (1/√2)(λ/√2)
= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2
= -λ^3 + λ

So the characteristic equation is det = 0:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor out λ:

λ(-λ² +1 ) =0.

So the roots are λ=0, and λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

So the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

The problem asks for the probability of getting 0.

So the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and find the squared magnitude, which gives the probability.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So for P v = 0, the matrix P is:

[
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

We can write the equations for each component:

First equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 =0 → v1 + v3=0.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So from first equation, v2=0. From third equation, same conclusion.

From second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3), where v1 = -v3.

We can represent this as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1).

Wait, let me check that. If v1 = -v3, let me set v3 = a, so v1 = -a. So the vector is (-a, 0, a) → a*(-1, 0, 1). So the eigenvector can be written as (-1,0,1), or any scalar multiple.

Alternatively, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), but wait, let me compute the normalization.

The vector is (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =1 +0 +1=2. So the normalization factor is 1/√2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think: when I set v3 = a, then v1 = -a, so the vector is ( -a, 0, a ) = a*(-1, 0,1 ), so the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) because the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 + (1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2,0,-1/√2).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the state vector is given as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. To find the probability, I need to compute the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, another approach: since P is the observable, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

The projection is given by (v · |ψ>) / (v · v) ) * v, but since v is normalized, it's just the inner product v† |ψ>, and the probability is |v† |ψ>|².

The eigenvector v is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let me write it as a column vector:

v = [ 1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ]

So the inner product is v† |ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) ) = (-2/√2) )= (-√2 ).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the inner product should be a scalar. Oh but let me compute it again.

v† is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2], and |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1].

So the inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) → sum is (-2/√2) → which is (-√2) because 2/√2 is sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)*1, so 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

Wait, 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So (-2/sqrt(2)) is -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but the state is a vector, and the eigenvector is normalized. So the probability is |<v|ψ>|².

But wait, |v| is 1, so the probability is |a|² where a is the inner product.

Wait, but wait: the inner product <v |ψ> is a complex number, but in this case, it's real. So the probability is (a)^2 where a is the inner product.

But wait, let me compute it again.

Compute inner product: (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) → (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (-sqrt(2))² = 2.

But wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah! Wait, I think I messed up the eigenvector. Because the vector I found is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), but perhaps I should have a different eigenvector. Let me double-check the eigenvectors.

Wait, when I solved P v = 0, I found v2=0, v1 = -v3.

So the vector [v1,0,v3] must satisfy v1 = -v3.

So if I take v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the vector is [-a, 0, a], which is a*(-1,0,1). So the eigenvector can be (1,0,-1) scaled by a. But wait, the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Wait, because the norm is sqrt( (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Alternatively, perhaps I could have taken the eigenvector as (1,0,-1), but I normalized it by dividing by sqrt(2).

Wait, but let's compute the inner product again with this vector.

v = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ]

|ψ> = [-1, 2,1].

Their inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Did I correctly find the eigenvector for λ=0?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector is orthogonal to v. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should have set up the eigenvectors correctly. Let me re-express the equations.

The system P v =0:

Equation 1: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 +v3=0.

Equation 3: (1/√2) v2 =0 → same as equation 1.

So v2 must be 0, and v1 = -v3.

So possible eigenvectors are any vectors of the form [a, 0, -a], where a is a scalar.

So for example, [1,0,-1], which is the same as a=1, and [2,0,-2] etc.

But when I compute the inner product between [1,0,-1] and |ψ> = [-1,2,1], I get (-1)(1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

The norm of [1,0,-1] is sqrt(1 + 0 +1) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So the inner product is (1/√2)*(-1) +0*(2) + (-1/√2)*1 → (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) )= (-2/√2 )= -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2=2. So the probability is 2, which is impossible. That's a problem.

Wait, but that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the eigenvector. Let me think again.

Wait, the state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1 +4 +1)= sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, maybe that's why.

Wait, the state vector's norm is sqrt(6). So when I compute the inner product, I should perhaps normalize it as well. Or does that not matter because I'm taking the squared magnitude?

Wait, the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2, where v is normalized. But in our case, the inner product is computed as (v†)ψ, and since v is a unit vector, it's correct.

But our calculation gives us <v|ψ> = -sqrt(2), and | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2. Which is impossible because probability can't be more than 1. So that implies a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, let me re-solve the system P v =0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0 → equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 → equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0 → equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3.

So the vector is (v1, 0, v3) = (a, 0, -a), where a is any scalar.

So the eigenvector is any multiple of (1,0,-1).

Wait, perhaps I should have taken v as (1,0,-1), but then when I take the inner product with |ψ> = (-1,2,1), I get (1)(-1) +0*(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2. 

But the vector (1,0,-1) is not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1) + 0*(2) + [-1/sqrt(2)]*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) )= (-sqrt(2)).

The square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the state is not normalized. Oh! The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1), which is not a unit vector. So perhaps I should normalize it first before computing the probability. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, but maybe this one isn't.

Let me compute the norm of |ψ>:

||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6).

So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

So perhaps I should compute the inner product with the normalized state.

Let me proceed again.

The normalized state vector is |ψ_normalized> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

The normalized eigenvector v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product is v† |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3))

Similarly, the third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So the sum is [ (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) for the given state vector \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

After expanding and simplifying, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues are therefore \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Find the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvalue equation \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \) gives the following system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \implies v_1 = -v_3 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvector is of the form \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, 0, v_3) \), where \( v_1 = -v_3 \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto the eigenvector
The state vector \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
| \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \( | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute the terms:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
\left| \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the state of the system is a vector. So to find the probability, I probably need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors or something like that.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). So that's a column vector with three components. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The matrix P has elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0,1/sqrt(2), 0. So I should write that down. Let me visualize it:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I think the first step is to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues. The question asks for the probability of getting 0 as the result. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the probability.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues? Oh right, I need to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set that up.

So, compute the determinant of (P - λI). The matrix P - λI would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step. The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (the third term is zero because the first element is zero)

Wait, no, maybe I should expand along the first row since the third element is zero, which might simplify calculations.

Expanding along the first row:

det = (-λ) * det of the minor matrix obtained by removing first row and column.

The minor is:
[
[-λ, 1/√2],
[1/√2, -λ]
]

So the determinant of this minor is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Then, the next term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times the determinant of the minor for the (1,2) element.

Minor for (1,2) is:
[
[1/√2, 1/√2],
[0, -λ]
]

Wait, no, wait. The minor for (1,2) is the matrix you get by removing row 1 and column 2. So it's:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So the minor is:
Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2).

But remember, it's multiplied by (1/√2) and (-1)^(1+2) which is -1.

So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)*(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

The third term in the expansion is 0, so we can ignore it.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (-λ) multiplied by (λ² - 1/2), the second term is (1/√2)*(-1)^(1+2) * [determinant of minor], which is (1/√2)*(-1)*(-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

Wait, but the sign for the second term in expansion is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the coefficient for the (1,2) term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1) * [determinant].

So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) )= (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

So the determinant is:

det = (-λ)(λ² - (1/2)) + (λ/2) = ?

Wait, no. The determinant is the sum of all these terms. The first term is (-λ) multiplied by (λ² - 1/2), the second term is (1/√2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times the minor determinant. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully. The determinant expansion along the first row is:

det = (-λ) * M11 + (1/√2) * (-1)^{1+2} * M12 + 0 * M13

Where M11 is the minor for (1,1), which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ [-λ, 1/√2],
  [1/√2, -λ] ]

Which is λ² - (1/2).

M12 is the minor for (1,2), which is the determinant of the matrix:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
  [0, -λ] ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2) * (-1)^3 * (-λ/√2) )

Simplify the exponents: (-1)^3 is -1. So:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2)
= (-λ^3 + (λ)/2) ) + (1/√2)(λ/√2)
= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2
= -λ^3 + λ

So the characteristic equation is det = 0:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor out λ:

λ(-λ² +1 ) =0.

So the roots are λ=0, and λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

So the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

The problem asks for the probability of getting 0.

So the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and find the squared magnitude, which gives the probability.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So for P v = 0, the matrix P is:

[
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

We can write the equations for each component:

First equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 =0 → v1 + v3=0.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So from first equation, v2=0. From third equation, same conclusion.

From second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3), where v1 = -v3.

We can represent this as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1).

Wait, let me check that. If v1 = -v3, let me set v3 = a, so v1 = -a. So the vector is (-a, 0, a) → a*(-1, 0, 1). So the eigenvector can be written as (-1,0,1), or any scalar multiple.

Alternatively, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), but wait, let me compute the normalization.

The vector is (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =1 +0 +1=2. So the normalization factor is 1/√2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think: when I set v3 = a, then v1 = -a, so the vector is ( -a, 0, a ) = a*(-1, 0,1 ), so the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) because the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 + (1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2,0,-1/√2).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the state vector is given as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. To find the probability, I need to compute the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, another approach: since P is the observable, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

The projection is given by (v · |ψ>) / (v · v) ) * v, but since v is normalized, it's just the inner product v† |ψ>, and the probability is |v† |ψ>|².

The eigenvector v is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let me write it as a column vector:

v = [ 1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ]

So the inner product is v† |ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) ) = (-2/√2) )= (-√2 ).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the inner product should be a scalar. Oh but let me compute it again.

v† is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2], and |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1].

So the inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) → sum is (-2/√2) → which is (-√2) because 2/√2 is sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)*1, so 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

Wait, 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So (-2/sqrt(2)) is -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but the state is a vector, and the eigenvector is normalized. So the probability is |<v|ψ>|².

But wait, |v| is 1, so the probability is |a|² where a is the inner product.

Wait, but wait: the inner product <v |ψ> is a complex number, but in this case, it's real. So the probability is (a)^2 where a is the inner product.

But wait, let me compute it again.

Compute inner product: (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) → (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (-sqrt(2))² = 2.

But wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah! Wait, I think I messed up the eigenvector. Because the vector I found is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), but perhaps I should have a different eigenvector. Let me double-check the eigenvectors.

Wait, when I solved P v = 0, I found v2=0, v1 = -v3.

So the vector [v1,0,v3] must satisfy v1 = -v3.

So if I take v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the vector is [-a, 0, a], which is a*(-1,0,1). So the eigenvector can be (1,0,-1) scaled by a. But wait, the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Wait, because the norm is sqrt( (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Alternatively, perhaps I could have taken the eigenvector as (1,0,-1), but I normalized it by dividing by sqrt(2).

Wait, but let's compute the inner product again with this vector.

v = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ]

|ψ> = [-1, 2,1].

Their inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Did I correctly find the eigenvector for λ=0?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector is orthogonal to v. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should have set up the eigenvectors correctly. Let me re-express the equations.

The system P v =0:

Equation 1: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 +v3=0.

Equation 3: (1/√2) v2 =0 → same as equation 1.

So v2 must be 0, and v1 = -v3.

So possible eigenvectors are any vectors of the form [a, 0, -a], where a is a scalar.

So for example, [1,0,-1], which is the same as a=1, and [2,0,-2] etc.

But when I compute the inner product between [1,0,-1] and |ψ> = [-1,2,1], I get (-1)(1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

The norm of [1,0,-1] is sqrt(1 + 0 +1) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So the inner product is (1/√2)*(-1) +0*(2) + (-1/√2)*1 → (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) )= (-2/√2 )= -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2=2. So the probability is 2, which is impossible. That's a problem.

Wait, but that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the eigenvector. Let me think again.

Wait, the state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1 +4 +1)= sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, maybe that's why.

Wait, the state vector's norm is sqrt(6). So when I compute the inner product, I should perhaps normalize it as well. Or does that not matter because I'm taking the squared magnitude?

Wait, the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2, where v is normalized. But in our case, the inner product is computed as (v†)ψ, and since v is a unit vector, it's correct.

But our calculation gives us <v|ψ> = -sqrt(2), and | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2. Which is impossible because probability can't be more than 1. So that implies a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, let me re-solve the system P v =0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0 → equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 → equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0 → equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3.

So the vector is (v1, 0, v3) = (a, 0, -a), where a is any scalar.

So the eigenvector is any multiple of (1,0,-1).

Wait, perhaps I should have taken v as (1,0,-1), but then when I take the inner product with |ψ> = (-1,2,1), I get (1)(-1) +0*(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2. 

But the vector (1,0,-1) is not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1) + 0*(2) + [-1/sqrt(2)]*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) )= (-sqrt(2)).

The square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the state is not normalized. Oh! The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1), which is not a unit vector. So perhaps I should normalize it first before computing the probability. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, but maybe this one isn't.

Let me compute the norm of |ψ>:

||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6).

So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

So perhaps I should compute the inner product with the normalized state.

Let me proceed again.

The normalized state vector is |ψ_normalized> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

The normalized eigenvector v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product is v† |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3))

Similarly, the third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So the sum is [ (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) for the given state vector \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

After expanding and simplifying, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues are therefore \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Find the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvalue equation \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \) gives the following system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \implies v_1 = -v_3 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvector is of the form \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, 0, v_3) \), where \( v_1 = -v_3 \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto the eigenvector
The state vector \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
| \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \( | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute the terms:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
\left| \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} \).
