Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, which I see are either around 1.38, 8.68, etc.

Hmm, so first I remember that when you mix acids and bases, it's a neutralization reaction. The first thing I need to do is figure out how much acid and how much base we're dealing with in terms of moles, then see which one is in excess after neutralization.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but I'll get to that later.

Next, HCl. It's 400 mL of 0.2 M. So 0.2 * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, meaning 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when mixing acids and bases, the H+ will react with OH- to form water. So the total H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully release H+. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-. So the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ available is from both HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, does CH3COOH contribute H+ in the same way as HCl? Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, so all its H+ is available. CH3COOH, being weak, only partially dissociates, but in the presence of a strong base, would that affect its dissociation? Hmm, maybe I should consider the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps I should first neutralize the H+ and OH- from the strong acid and base, then deal with any excess, and then see what's left.

Wait, but the question is about the solution after mixing all three. So let's proceed.

First, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08. The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

So when H+ and OH- react, the H+ will be neutralized by OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- in excess.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 gives more OH- than H+ from HCl. So the OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

But what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, and since we have excess OH-, it will react with the OH- as well. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid, which is a weak acid.

Wait, but wait, the OH- is in excess after neutralizing HCl. So the OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which can donate a proton. OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- will react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So let's calculate how much OH- is left after reacting with acetic acid.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The moles of OH- after HCl neutralization are 0.10. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl: 0.10.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So when 0.05 moles of OH- react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, the OH- is consumed, and the CH3COOH is also consumed, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So after this, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the OH- is 0.10, and the CH3COOH is 0.05. So all the CH3COOH is consumed, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So now, the total solution volume is the sum of all three solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L of solution.

Wait, but wait, but H+ can also come from the acetate ions, right? Because when CH3COOH is neutralized by OH-, it becomes CH3COO^-. Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it can hydrolyze in water, producing OH-.

Wait, but in this case, we've already consumed all the CH3COOH, so the only species left is the acetate ion. But if there is excess OH- in solution, adding more OH- would make the solution even more basic, right? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The reaction between the OH- and the acetic acid consumes the OH- and the acetic acid, leaving some OH-.

Wait, let me retrace:

1. HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+.

2. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

3. These H+ and OH- react, neutralizing each other. So H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.08), leaving OH- of 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

4. Now, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So now, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, but the solution also contains the acetate ions, which can hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So the acetate ion will produce OH- in solution, which may affect the pH.

Hmm, so now the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess, plus some OH- from the acetate ion hydrolysis.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Since we're in a solution where the OH- concentration is already significant, the contribution from acetate may be negligible compared to the excess OH-.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me try to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the excess OH- is the main contributor, and the acetate's contribution is minor.

So, the total moles of OH- after all reactions are 0.05 moles (from excess) plus any from acetate.

Wait, but let's calculate.

The solution after all reactions:

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

- Acetate ion (CH3COO^-): 0.05 moles.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Acetic acid has a Ka of about 1.8 × 10^-5. Since Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH], the Kb would be Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So Kb is very small, which means the hydrolysis of acetate will produce a small amount of OH-.

So the initial concentration of acetate is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

The Kb is 5.56e-10, so the hydrolysis will proceed to a small extent, say x.

The expression would be Kb = x² / (0.04167 - x) ≈ x² / 0.04167.

So x = sqrt(Kb * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(2.316e-11) ≈ 4.81e-6.

So [OH-] from acetate is approximately 4.81e-6 M.

But wait, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, which is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. So [OH-] from excess is about 0.0417 M.

The OH- from acetate is about 4.81e-6 M, which is much smaller than 0.0417. So the contribution from acetate is negligible compared to the excess OH-.

Therefore, the total [OH-] is approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait, no. The total [OH-] would be the sum of the excess OH- and that from acetate. But since the excess is much larger, adding a tiny bit more won't change it significantly. So for practical purposes, the [OH-] is dominated by the excess OH-.

So, [OH-] ≈ 0.0417 M.

So, pOH is log(1/[OH-]) = log(1/0.0417) ≈ log(24) ≈ 1.38. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pOH is -log10 [OH-].

Wait, [OH-] is 0.0417 M. So pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

Yes, because 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417. So pOH is about 1.38, which makes the pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.0417 is 4.17e-2 M. So the pOH is -log(4.17e-2). Let me calculate that.

Log(4.17e-2) is log(4.17) + log(1e-2) = 0.619 + (-2) = -1.381. So pOH = 1.381. pH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619, which is approximately 12.62. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but the options are A)12.62, B)1.38, etc. So that would be option A.

But wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me go back through the steps again.

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, which provides 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

2. Neutralize H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2.

H+ (0.08) + OH- (0.18) → 0.08 moles of H2O, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

3. Now, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH (0.05 mol) + OH- (0.10 mol) → CH3COO^- (0.05 mol) and OH- (0.05 mol left).

4. So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- and 0.05 mol CH3COO^-.

5. The OH- from excess Ba(OH)2 contributes to the solution.

6. The CH3COO^- can hydrolyze, but as calculated, contributes a negligible amount of OH-.

So, the main source of OH- is the 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, which is 0.0417 M.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62.

So the correct answer would be option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I should consider the total H+ and OH- including the weak acid's contribution. But since the solution is strongly basic (due to excess OH-), the weak acid's H+ would be negligible compared to the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: after neutralization, the excess is OH-, so pH is determined by that.

So I'm confident the pH is around 12.62, which is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributed by the acids and bases:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and fully dissociates.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and fully dissociates, producing 2 moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

Next, we neutralize the H⁺ and OH⁻:

4. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   The 0.08 moles of H⁺ from HCl react with 0.08 moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂, leaving:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ react with 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH, neutralizing the acid and leaving:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

6. **Total solution volume**:  
   The total volume is the sum of the three solutions:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]

7. **Concentration of OH⁻**:  
   The remaining 0.05 moles of OH⁻ are distributed in 1.2 L:  
   \[
   [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
   \]

8. **pOH and pH**:  
   The pOH is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[0.0417] \approx 1.38.
   \]  
   Since pH + pOH = 14:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, which I see are either around 1.38, 8.68, etc.

Hmm, so first I remember that when you mix acids and bases, it's a neutralization reaction. The first thing I need to do is figure out how much acid and how much base we're dealing with in terms of moles, then see which one is in excess after neutralization.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but I'll get to that later.

Next, HCl. It's 400 mL of 0.2 M. So 0.2 * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, meaning 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when mixing acids and bases, the H+ will react with OH- to form water. So the total H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully release H+. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-. So the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ available is from both HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, does CH3COOH contribute H+ in the same way as HCl? Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, so all its H+ is available. CH3COOH, being weak, only partially dissociates, but in the presence of a strong base, would that affect its dissociation? Hmm, maybe I should consider the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps I should first neutralize the H+ and OH- from the strong acid and base, then deal with any excess, and then see what's left.

Wait, but the question is about the solution after mixing all three. So let's proceed.

First, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08. The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

So when H+ and OH- react, the H+ will be neutralized by OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- in excess.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 gives more OH- than H+ from HCl. So the OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

But what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, and since we have excess OH-, it will react with the OH- as well. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid, which is a weak acid.

Wait, but wait, the OH- is in excess after neutralizing HCl. So the OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which can donate a proton. OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- will react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So let's calculate how much OH- is left after reacting with acetic acid.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The moles of OH- after HCl neutralization are 0.10. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl: 0.10.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So when 0.05 moles of OH- react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, the OH- is consumed, and the CH3COOH is also consumed, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So after this, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the OH- is 0.10, and the CH3COOH is 0.05. So all the CH3COOH is consumed, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So now, the total solution volume is the sum of all three solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L of solution.

Wait, but wait, but H+ can also come from the acetate ions, right? Because when CH3COOH is neutralized by OH-, it becomes CH3COO^-. Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it can hydrolyze in water, producing OH-.

Wait, but in this case, we've already consumed all the CH3COOH, so the only species left is the acetate ion. But if there is excess OH- in solution, adding more OH- would make the solution even more basic, right? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

1. HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+.

2. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

3. These H+ and OH- react, neutralizing each other. So H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.08), leaving OH- of 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

4. Now, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So now, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, but the solution also contains the acetate ions, which can hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So the acetate ion will produce OH- in solution, which may affect the pH.

Hmm, so now the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess, plus some OH- from the acetate ion hydrolysis.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Since we're in a solution where the OH- concentration is already significant, the contribution from acetate may be negligible compared to the excess OH-.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me try to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the excess OH- is the main contributor, and the acetate's contribution is minor.

So, the total moles of OH- after all reactions are 0.05 moles (from excess) plus any from acetate.

Wait, but let's calculate.

The solution after all reactions:

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

- Acetate ion (CH3COO^-): 0.05 moles.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Acetic acid has a Ka of about 1.8 × 10^-5. Since Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH], the Kb would be Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So Kb is very small, which means the hydrolysis of acetate will produce a small amount of OH-.

So the initial concentration of acetate is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

The Kb is 5.56e-10, so the hydrolysis will proceed to a small extent, say x.

The expression would be Kb = x² / (0.04167 - x) ≈ x² / 0.04167.

So x = sqrt(Kb * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(2.316e-11) ≈ 4.81e-6.

So [OH-] from acetate is approximately 4.81e-6 M.

But wait, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, which is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. So [OH-] from excess is about 0.0417 M.

The OH- from acetate is about 4.81e-6 M, which is much smaller than 0.0417. So the contribution from acetate is negligible compared to the excess OH-.

Therefore, the total [OH-] is approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait, no. The total [OH-] would be the sum of the excess OH- and that from acetate. But since the excess is much larger, adding a tiny bit more won't change it significantly. So for practical purposes, the [OH-] is dominated by the excess OH-.

So, [OH-] ≈ 0.0417 M.

So, pOH is log(1/[OH-]) = log(1/0.0417) ≈ log(24) ≈ 1.38. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pOH is -log10 [OH-].

Wait, [OH-] is 0.0417 M. So pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

Yes, because 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417. So pOH is about 1.38, which makes the pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.0417 is 4.17e-2 M. So the pOH is -log(4.17e-2). Let me calculate that.

Log(4.17e-2) is log(4.17) + log(1e-2) = 0.619 + (-2) = -1.381. So pOH = 1.381. pH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619, which is approximately 12.62. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but the options are A)12.62, B)1.38, etc. So that would be option A.

But wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me go back through the steps again.

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, which provides 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

2. Neutralize H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2.

H+ (0.08) + OH- (0.18) → 0.08 moles of H2O, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

3. Now, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH (0.05 mol) + OH- (0.10 mol) → CH3COO^- (0.05 mol) and OH- (0.05 mol left).

4. So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- and 0.05 mol CH3COO^-.

5. The OH- from excess Ba(OH)2 contributes to the solution.

6. The CH3COO^- can hydrolyze, but as calculated, contributes a negligible amount of OH-.

So, the main source of OH- is the 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, which is 0.0417 M.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62.

So the correct answer would be option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I should consider the total H+ and OH- including the weak acid's contribution. But since the solution is strongly basic (due to excess OH-), the weak acid's H+ would be negligible compared to the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: after neutralization, the excess is OH-, so pH is determined by that.

So I'm confident the pH is around 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributed by the acids and bases:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and fully dissociates.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and fully dissociates, producing 2 moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

Next, we neutralize the H⁺ and OH⁻:

4. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   The 0.08 moles of H⁺ from HCl react with 0.08 moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂, leaving:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ react with 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH, neutralizing the acid and leaving:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

6. **Total solution volume**:  
   The total volume is the sum of the three solutions:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]

7. **Concentration of OH⁻**:  
   The remaining 0.05 moles of OH⁻ are distributed in 1.2 L:  
   \[
   [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
   \]

8. **pOH and pH**:  
   The pOH is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[0.0417] \approx 1.38.
   \]  
   Since pH + pOH = 14:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
