Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question says the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. And the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, the state is |ψ⟩ = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - (⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩)^2. So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh, that's helpful because in that basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Alternatively, since the state is written in the P_z basis, the expectation value of P_z is straightforward. Each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me look at the matrix for P_z. It's diagonal: first element is ħ, second is 0, third is -ħ.

So in the state |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, the probability of each state is |a|², |b|², |c|². So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a² * ħ + b² * 0 + c² * (-ħ).

Wait, no, no, because the state is written as a column vector in the P_z basis, which are |+⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively. So the components are the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So in this case, the state is |ψ⟩ = ( -1/2 ) |+⟩ + (1/√2) |0⟩ + ( -1/2 ) |-⟩.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) ). Let me compute that:

(-1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by ħ gives (1/4)ħ. Then (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, times 0 is 0. Then (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, times (-ħ) is (-1/4 ħ).

So adding them together: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is the square of each eigenvalue. So each term is |amplitude|^2 times (eigenvalue)^2.

So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. Squared, they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ( (1/4) * ħ² ) + ( (1/2) * 0 ) + ( (1/4) * ħ² ) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ), which is sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but the options are given. Let me check the options. Option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it via the matrix method for confirmation. Let's see.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The matrix P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ).

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ. Wait, no, because P_z is diagonal, so when you multiply, each element is the amplitude squared times the eigenvalue.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ψ† P_z ψ explicitly.

But wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

P_z is a diagonal matrix:

[ ħ 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 -ħ ]

So ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ , (1/√2)*0 , (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] => [ -ħ/2 , 0, ħ/2 ]

Then multiply by ψ: [ -ħ/2 * (-1/2) ) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2) ]

So that's (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Yep, same as before.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩: P_z² is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ψ† P_z² ψ = [ (-1/2)^2 * ħ² + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ].

Which is (1/4 ħ²) + (1/2 *0 ) + (1/4 ħ²) ) = (1/2 ħ²).

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis states. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.
- $\left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $0$.
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $-\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.

Adding these together:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.
- $\left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $0$.
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.

Adding these together:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question says the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. And the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, the state is |ψ⟩ = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - (⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩)^2. So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh, that's helpful because in that basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Alternatively, since the state is written in the P_z basis, the expectation value of P_z is straightforward. Each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me look at the matrix for P_z. It's diagonal: first element is ħ, second is 0, third is -ħ.

So in the state |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, the probability of each state is |a|², |b|², |c|². So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a² * ħ + b² * 0 + c² * (-ħ).

Wait, no, no, because the state is written as a column vector in the P_z basis, which are |+⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively. So the components are the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So in this case, the state is |ψ⟩ = ( -1/2 ) |+⟩ + (1/√2) |0⟩ + ( -1/2 ) |-⟩.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) ). Let me compute that:

(-1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by ħ gives (1/4)ħ. Then (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, times 0 is 0. Then (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, times (-ħ) is (-1/4 ħ).

So adding them together: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is the square of each eigenvalue. So each term is |amplitude|^2 times (eigenvalue)^2.

So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. Squared, they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ( (1/4) * ħ² ) + ( (1/2) * 0 ) + ( (1/4) * ħ² ) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ), which is sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but the options are given. Let me check the options. Option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it via the matrix method for confirmation. Let's see.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The matrix P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ).

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ. Wait, no, because P_z is diagonal, so when you multiply, each element is the amplitude squared times the eigenvalue.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ψ† P_z ψ explicitly.

But wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

P_z is a diagonal matrix:

[ ħ 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 -ħ ]

So ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ , (1/√2)*0 , (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] => [ -ħ/2 , 0, ħ/2 ]

Then multiply by ψ: [ -ħ/2 * (-1/2) ) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2) ]

So that's (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Yep, same as before.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩: P_z² is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ψ† P_z² ψ = [ (-1/2)^2 * ħ² + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ].

Which is (1/4 ħ²) + (1/2 *0 ) + (1/4 ħ²) ) = (1/2 ħ²).

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis states. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.
- $\left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $0$.
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $-\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.

Adding these together:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.
- $\left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $0$.
- $\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.

Adding these together:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
