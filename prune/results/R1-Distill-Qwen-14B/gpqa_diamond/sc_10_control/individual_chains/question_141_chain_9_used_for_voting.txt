Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's dive in step by step.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, "d" stands for deuterium. So it's a benzene ring with a bromine on the first carbon and a deuterium on the second. So the structure is a benzene ring where position 1 has Br and position 2 has D (deuterium). 

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, this is in an ammonia solvent, which is a protic environment. Wait, no, ammonia is actually a weak base but it's used as a solvent here. Or wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or perhaps a substitution.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is a bromide. So maybe it's an aromatic substitution. But wait, under what conditions does NaNH2 induce substitution on an aromatic ring?

Another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for elimination reactions, especially for dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but that's more for aliphatic systems. So for aromatic compounds, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, but when dealing with aromatic halides, there are a few possibilities. One common reaction is nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups. Bromobenzene is not activated, so maybe that's not it here.

Alternatively, if the ring is activated, but in this case, it's just bromobenzene with deuterium. Wait, but bromine is a deactivating group, so substitution might not be favored unless there's a strong base.

Wait, another possibility: elimination to form a benzyn intermediate. Benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene loses two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond. But wait, in this case, we have only one Br and a deuterium. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but wait, maybe the deuterium isn't just a substituent but part of a leaving group. Or perhaps it's acting as a hydrogen in some way.

Wait, another angle: when you have a benzene ring with substituents in the ortho position, like Br and another group, and you treat it with a strong base. I'm trying to recall if this leads to some kind of elimination or nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but in the aromatic ring. Wait, but that would require adjacent leaving groups, I think. If I have Br on C1 and D on C2, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, but wait, can that happen with just Br and D?

Wait, let me think about the structure again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have Br on one carbon and D (deuterium) on the adjacent carbon. So when NaNH2, a strong base, is added, it might abstract a proton (deuterium is a hydrogen isotope) from the ring. But wait, D is a heavier isotope, so maybe it's less reactive. Hmm, but in the ring, the hydrogen adjacent to Br might be more acidic.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from the carbon adjacent to Br, that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge next to Br. Wait, maybe that leads to a ring contraction or expansion? Or perhaps elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzynes), but that requires two adjacent leaving groups. Since we have only one Br and a D, maybe that's not feasible. Unless the D is a leaving group, but D is not a good leaving group. Wait, but in some cases, deuterium can act as H, but in reactions that require H, the deuterium is more inert.

Wait a minute, perhaps this is a case of elimination where the Br leaves as Br- and a neighboring H (or D) is abstracted by the base, leading to formation of a benzyn intermediate. But wait, for benzynes, you typically need two halogen atoms adjacent to each other so they can eliminate and form a triple bond. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base would lose two Br atoms as Br- and form a triple bond, resulting in benzynes.

But in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, so only one Br and a D. That's one substituent. So maybe that's not enough for elimination to form a benzyne.

Wait, is there another possibility? Maybe the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from the ring, leading to an aromatic ring with a negative charge, which could then attack another position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium isn't involved in the reaction. Let me think about how the NaNH2 would react with bromobenzene in ammonia. Wait, I think NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can deprotonate compounds. For example, in the Birch reduction, but that's for arenes with strong activating groups, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, but in an aromatic system. So, perhaps Br is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination and formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne). But as I thought earlier, that requires two leaving groups, right?

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is in the para position? No, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so it's ortho.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but on the aromatic ring. For that, the ring must be activated. Bromobenzene is deactivating, so unless under very strong conditions, nucleophilic substitution isn't likely. But perhaps the presence of a strong base like NaNH2 can facilitate such a substitution.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the Br is replaced by an amide group. Because NaNH2 is a strong base and in ammonia, it could act as a source of NH2^-.

So, maybe the bromide leaves, and an amide group (NH2^-) attacks, leading to substitution. But in that case, the product would be benzene with an NH2 group at position 1. Would that be possible?

Wait, but aromatic nucleophilic substitution typically requires a strongly activating group, like -NH2, but in this case, the leaving group (Br) is in a position where the ring is deactivated. So perhaps that's not feasible.

Alternatively, could it be an elimination reaction that forms a triple bond? But again, without two leaving groups adjacent, I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the deuterium is in the ortho position to Br. So maybe the base abstracts the deuterium, making a benzene ring with a negative charge at C2 and Br at C1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require losing Br and D at the same time, which seems unlikely because D is not a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (not the deuterium) from the ring. Let's say, for example, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is meta to Br. Then, what happens? Maybe a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of what reactions typically occur when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia.

Wait, I think that when a benzene ring has two halogens adjacent to each other (like 1,2-dibromo), treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate both halogens, forming a triple bond (benzyne). But in this case, there's only one Br and a D, so perhaps that's not applicable.

But wait, maybe the deuterium isn't a halogen, so it doesn't contribute to the elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. So, 1-bromobenzene would become benzene with an NH2 group in position 1. But then, considering the deuterium in position 2, which is adjacent to the substituent. So would that affect the product?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, where the Br and a neighboring H (or D) are removed, forming a triple bond. So, in this case, if the Br is on C1 and D is on C2, the base could abstract a H from C2, leading to elimination of Br and D, and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require losing both Br and D as leaving groups, but D is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the D is abstracted as a D- leaving group, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. The base could abstract a proton from C2, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2. Then, the Br on C1 could leave as Br-? But aromatic rings can't have negative charges like that, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, leading to a diradical or some kind of ring expansion, but I'm not familiar with that.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to look for similar reactions. Oh wait, this is a substitution reaction. Wait, another possibility: when a benzene ring has a substituent that can act as a leaving group, like bromine, and the ring is activated, perhaps the base can induce elimination. But again, I'm not sure about the specific conditions.

Wait, another angle: the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a strong base. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene isn't activated, but if the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, it can undergo nucleophilic substitution. But in this case, the only substituent is Br, which is deactivating.

Wait, but wait, sometimes in certain conditions, like high temperatures and strong bases, even deactivated rings can undergo substitution. So perhaps the NaNH2 in ammonia could deprotonate the ring to generate a strongly activated ring, making nucleophilic substitution possible.

Wait, but the ring in this case is already not very activated. So maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

But let me think about the products. If substitution occurs, the product would be aniline with the NH2 group in the same position as Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, forming a triple bond (benzynes), that would lead to a diradical or possibly some rearrangement products. But without the second halogen, I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium from C2, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge at C2. Then, the nearby Br could leave, but that would require a good leaving group. Hmm, but Br- is a good leaving group.

Wait, so maybe the base (NH2^-) abstracts the D from C2, making a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2. Then, the Br on C1 could leave as Br^- (since it's adjacent), forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. So that would form a benzyne intermediate, but with a deuterium somewhere.

But wait, that would require the abstracting of D and the loss of Br, which are on adjacent carbons. So the product would be a triple bond between C1 and C2, with whatever else is on the ring.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So after eliminating Br and D, the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the rest of the ring is H and perhaps some deuterium elsewhere. But wait, no, the D was on C2, and C1 and C2 are both losing substituents, so the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and no substituents, but the ring would be otherwise hydrogenated.

But wait, benzynes are highly strained and reactive. So after elimination, it would form a triple bond, but then what? It could react further or maybe undergo some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne would rearrange into something else. But I'm not sure how that would work.

But wait, I'm confusing things. Let's think again. The initial compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the reaction could abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to Br.

Suppose the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (the deuterium), but wait, C2 has a D, so maybe the base abstracts that. But D is more difficult to remove than H; perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position, like C3 or C4.

Wait, but the most acidic protons on bromobenzene are those ortho and para to the Br. So in this case, the H's on C2 and C4 (assuming Br is on C1) would be more acidic. Wait, but C2 has a D, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3 instead.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me visualize the benzene ring:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the H's on positions 3 and 4 (ortho to Br) are more acidic. The base could abstract a proton from position 3 or 4. Let's say it abstracts from C3.

After deprotonation at C3, the ring would have a negative charge on C3, which is meta to Br. Then, perhaps the Br could leave as Br-.

Wait, but if the Br leaves, what would form? The benzene ring would have a negative charge on C3 and a positive charge on C1? Or wait, no, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring would have a negative charge, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, but aromatic rings can't have charges, so the ring would have to reorganize. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts the D from C2, but D is less reactive. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3.

Wait, but without knowing exactly, perhaps the reaction forms a new substituent on the ring. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be benzene with an NH2 group at position 1 and a D at position 2. But wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So perhaps the substitution is via a different mechanism.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But how many products would form?

Wait, if substitution occurs, it should be a single product, since only Br is being replaced. But if elimination occurs, forming a triple bond, perhaps that's another product. But can both substitution and elimination happen under these conditions?

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to a ring contraction or expansion. If the Br leaves, and the ring undergoes a change in the number of carbons, but that's more common in non-aromatic systems, like cyclopropane rings.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think of the possible products.

If substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But I'm not sure if that's possible under these conditions.

If elimination occurs, perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But that would require losing both Br and a D, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no substitution or elimination occurs. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the possible number of products is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So what could be the possible products?

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to more than one product due to different attack positions. But in this case, the substituents are fixed at positions 1 and 2, so I'm not sure where else the attack could happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent in a different position, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could form a benzyl anion intermediate. When NaNH2 is used, it can deprotonate compounds to form strong bases. But for benzene, deprotonation would require a very acidic proton. So if the base abstracts a proton from the ring, perhaps the ring becomes negatively charged, leading to some rearrangement.

But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization, but that's a big change and I'm not sure about it.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the possible products are. 

If the reaction is substitution, the product would be 1-NH2, 2-D benzene. So that's one product. 

If elimination occurs, perhaps forming a triple bond (C1-C2), but I'm not sure if that's possible with just Br and D. So maybe the product is a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. That would be another product. So total two products.

But wait, forming a triple bond requires two leaving groups. Since we have only one Br and a D, perhaps this isn't feasible. So maybe elimination isn't possible, leaving only substitution as the possible reaction, leading to one product.

But wait, can the substitution happen in more than one position? No, because the ring structure is fixed; substitution would only occur at the position where Br is present. So substitution would yield only one product.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. So substitution would replace Br with NH2, resulting in 1-NH2-2-d benzene. So that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but I'm not sure. If elimination were possible, would it form another product?

Wait, but without two adjacent leaving groups, I don't think elimination can form a benzyne. So maybe substitution is the only possibility, giving one product.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option. Or maybe the reaction could form more than one product due to some other reason.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction. Deuterium is less reactive than H, so maybe the base can't abstract it, so the reaction doesn't happen. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is part of a hydrogen/deuterium exchange, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that only one product forms via substitution. So the number of possible organic products is 1, which is option B.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but the conditions here suggest a possible substitution or elimination mechanism.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   NaNH₂ in ammonia can act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom with an amide group (NH₂). This would result in the formation of 1-amino-2-d benzene. Bromobenzene is typically deactivated towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but under strong basic conditions, substitution is plausible. This would yield a single product.

2. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   Elimination reactions often require two adjacent leaving groups to form a triple bond (benzyne). However, the starting material has only one bromine atom and a deuterium atom, which is not sufficient for elimination. Additionally, deuterium is not a good leaving group, making elimination unlikely.

3. **Other Possibilities**:  
   The reaction could theoretically involve deprotonation of the ring, but the acidic protons ortho to bromine are less reactive due to the deactivating nature of bromine. Furthermore, the presence of deuterium complicates the reaction, as it is less reactive than hydrogen. No evidence suggests that the reaction would proceed via ring contraction, expansion, or dearomatization under these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reaction is substitution, where bromine is replaced by an amide group, yielding a single product: 1-amino-2-d benzene. No other plausible reaction pathways (such as elimination or rearrangement) are supported by the given conditions. Therefore, only one product is formed.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's dive in step by step.

But wait, this is in an ammonia solvent, which is a protic environment. Wait, no, ammonia is actually a weak base but it's used as a solvent here. Or wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or perhaps a substitution.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is a bromide. So maybe it's an aromatic substitution. But wait, under what conditions does NaNH2 induce substitution on an aromatic ring?

Alternatively, if the ring is activated, but in this case, it's just bromobenzene with deuterium. Wait, but bromine is a deactivating group, so substitution might not be favored unless there's a strong base.

Wait, another possibility: elimination to form a benzyn intermediate. Benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene loses two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond. But wait, in this case, we have only one Br and a deuterium. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but wait, maybe the deuterium isn't just a substituent but part of a leaving group. Or perhaps it's acting as a hydrogen in some way.

Wait, another angle: when you have a benzene ring with substituents in the ortho position, like Br and another group, and you treat it with a strong base. I'm trying to recall if this leads to some kind of elimination or nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but in the aromatic ring. Wait, but that would require adjacent leaving groups, I think. If I have Br on C1 and D on C2, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, but wait, can that happen with just Br and D?

Wait, let me think about the structure again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have Br on one carbon and D (deuterium) on the adjacent carbon. So when NaNH2, a strong base, is added, it might abstract a proton (deuterium is a hydrogen isotope) from the ring. But wait, D is a heavier isotope, so maybe it's less reactive. Hmm, but in the ring, the hydrogen adjacent to Br might be more acidic.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from the carbon adjacent to Br, that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge next to Br. Wait, maybe that leads to a ring contraction or expansion? Or perhaps elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzynes), but that requires two adjacent leaving groups. Since we have only one Br and a D, maybe that's not feasible. Unless the D is a leaving group, but D is not a good leaving group. Wait, but in some cases, deuterium can act as H, but in reactions that require H, the deuterium is more inert.

Wait a minute, perhaps this is a case of elimination where the Br leaves as Br- and a neighboring H (or D) is abstracted by the base, leading to formation of a benzyn intermediate. But wait, for benzynes, you typically need two halogen atoms adjacent to each other so they can eliminate and form a triple bond. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base would lose two Br atoms as Br- and form a triple bond, resulting in benzynes.

But in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, so only one Br and a D. That's one substituent. So maybe that's not enough for elimination to form a benzyne.

Wait, is there another possibility? Maybe the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from the ring, leading to an aromatic ring with a negative charge, which could then attack another position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium isn't involved in the reaction. Let me think about how the NaNH2 would react with bromobenzene in ammonia. Wait, I think NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can deprotonate compounds. For example, in the Birch reduction, but that's for arenes with strong activating groups, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, but in an aromatic system. So, perhaps Br is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination and formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne). But as I thought earlier, that requires two leaving groups, right?

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is in the para position? No, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so it's ortho.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but on the aromatic ring. For that, the ring must be activated. Bromobenzene is deactivating, so unless under very strong conditions, nucleophilic substitution isn't likely. But perhaps the presence of a strong base like NaNH2 can facilitate such a substitution.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the Br is replaced by an amide group. Because NaNH2 is a strong base and in ammonia, it could act as a source of NH2^-.

So, maybe the bromide leaves, and an amide group (NH2^-) attacks, leading to substitution. But in that case, the product would be benzene with an NH2 group at position 1. Would that be possible?

Wait, but aromatic nucleophilic substitution typically requires a strongly activating group, like -NH2, but in this case, the leaving group (Br) is in a position where the ring is deactivated. So perhaps that's not feasible.

Alternatively, could it be an elimination reaction that forms a triple bond? But again, without two leaving groups adjacent, I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the deuterium is in the ortho position to Br. So maybe the base abstracts the deuterium, making a benzene ring with a negative charge at C2 and Br at C1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require losing Br and D at the same time, which seems unlikely because D is not a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (not the deuterium) from the ring. Let's say, for example, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is meta to Br. Then, what happens? Maybe a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of what reactions typically occur when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia.

Wait, I think that when a benzene ring has two halogens adjacent to each other (like 1,2-dibromo), treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate both halogens, forming a triple bond (benzyne). But in this case, there's only one Br and a D, so perhaps that's not applicable.

But wait, maybe the deuterium isn't a halogen, so it doesn't contribute to the elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. So, 1-bromobenzene would become benzene with an NH2 group in position 1. But then, considering the deuterium in position 2, which is adjacent to the substituent. So would that affect the product?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, where the Br and a neighboring H (or D) are removed, forming a triple bond. So, in this case, if the Br is on C1 and D is on C2, the base could abstract a H from C2, leading to elimination of Br and D, and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require losing both Br and D as leaving groups, but D is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the D is abstracted as a D- leaving group, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. The base could abstract a proton from C2, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2. Then, the Br on C1 could leave as Br-? But aromatic rings can't have negative charges like that, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, leading to a diradical or some kind of ring expansion, but I'm not familiar with that.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to look for similar reactions. Oh wait, this is a substitution reaction. Wait, another possibility: when a benzene ring has a substituent that can act as a leaving group, like bromine, and the ring is activated, perhaps the base can induce elimination. But again, I'm not sure about the specific conditions.

Wait, another angle: the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a strong base. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene isn't activated, but if the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, it can undergo nucleophilic substitution. But in this case, the only substituent is Br, which is deactivating.

Wait, but wait, sometimes in certain conditions, like high temperatures and strong bases, even deactivated rings can undergo substitution. So perhaps the NaNH2 in ammonia could deprotonate the ring to generate a strongly activated ring, making nucleophilic substitution possible.

Wait, but the ring in this case is already not very activated. So maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

But let me think about the products. If substitution occurs, the product would be aniline with the NH2 group in the same position as Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, forming a triple bond (benzynes), that would lead to a diradical or possibly some rearrangement products. But without the second halogen, I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium from C2, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge at C2. Then, the nearby Br could leave, but that would require a good leaving group. Hmm, but Br- is a good leaving group.

Wait, so maybe the base (NH2^-) abstracts the D from C2, making a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2. Then, the Br on C1 could leave as Br^- (since it's adjacent), forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. So that would form a benzyne intermediate, but with a deuterium somewhere.

But wait, that would require the abstracting of D and the loss of Br, which are on adjacent carbons. So the product would be a triple bond between C1 and C2, with whatever else is on the ring.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So after eliminating Br and D, the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the rest of the ring is H and perhaps some deuterium elsewhere. But wait, no, the D was on C2, and C1 and C2 are both losing substituents, so the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and no substituents, but the ring would be otherwise hydrogenated.

But wait, benzynes are highly strained and reactive. So after elimination, it would form a triple bond, but then what? It could react further or maybe undergo some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne would rearrange into something else. But I'm not sure how that would work.

But wait, I'm confusing things. Let's think again. The initial compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the reaction could abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to Br.

Suppose the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (the deuterium), but wait, C2 has a D, so maybe the base abstracts that. But D is more difficult to remove than H; perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position, like C3 or C4.

Wait, but the most acidic protons on bromobenzene are those ortho and para to the Br. So in this case, the H's on C2 and C4 (assuming Br is on C1) would be more acidic. Wait, but C2 has a D, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3 instead.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me visualize the benzene ring:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the H's on positions 3 and 4 (ortho to Br) are more acidic. The base could abstract a proton from position 3 or 4. Let's say it abstracts from C3.

After deprotonation at C3, the ring would have a negative charge on C3, which is meta to Br. Then, perhaps the Br could leave as Br-.

Wait, but if the Br leaves, what would form? The benzene ring would have a negative charge on C3 and a positive charge on C1? Or wait, no, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring would have a negative charge, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, but aromatic rings can't have charges, so the ring would have to reorganize. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts the D from C2, but D is less reactive. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3.

Wait, but without knowing exactly, perhaps the reaction forms a new substituent on the ring. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be benzene with an NH2 group at position 1 and a D at position 2. But wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So perhaps the substitution is via a different mechanism.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But how many products would form?

Wait, if substitution occurs, it should be a single product, since only Br is being replaced. But if elimination occurs, forming a triple bond, perhaps that's another product. But can both substitution and elimination happen under these conditions?

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to a ring contraction or expansion. If the Br leaves, and the ring undergoes a change in the number of carbons, but that's more common in non-aromatic systems, like cyclopropane rings.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think of the possible products.

If substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But I'm not sure if that's possible under these conditions.

If elimination occurs, perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But that would require losing both Br and a D, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no substitution or elimination occurs. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the possible number of products is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So what could be the possible products?

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to more than one product due to different attack positions. But in this case, the substituents are fixed at positions 1 and 2, so I'm not sure where else the attack could happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent in a different position, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could form a benzyl anion intermediate. When NaNH2 is used, it can deprotonate compounds to form strong bases. But for benzene, deprotonation would require a very acidic proton. So if the base abstracts a proton from the ring, perhaps the ring becomes negatively charged, leading to some rearrangement.

But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization, but that's a big change and I'm not sure about it.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the possible products are. 

If the reaction is substitution, the product would be 1-NH2, 2-D benzene. So that's one product. 

If elimination occurs, perhaps forming a triple bond (C1-C2), but I'm not sure if that's possible with just Br and D. So maybe the product is a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. That would be another product. So total two products.

But wait, forming a triple bond requires two leaving groups. Since we have only one Br and a D, perhaps this isn't feasible. So maybe elimination isn't possible, leaving only substitution as the possible reaction, leading to one product.

But wait, can the substitution happen in more than one position? No, because the ring structure is fixed; substitution would only occur at the position where Br is present. So substitution would yield only one product.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. So substitution would replace Br with NH2, resulting in 1-NH2-2-d benzene. So that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but I'm not sure. If elimination were possible, would it form another product?

Wait, but without two adjacent leaving groups, I don't think elimination can form a benzyne. So maybe substitution is the only possibility, giving one product.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option. Or maybe the reaction could form more than one product due to some other reason.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction. Deuterium is less reactive than H, so maybe the base can't abstract it, so the reaction doesn't happen. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is part of a hydrogen/deuterium exchange, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that only one product forms via substitution. So the number of possible organic products is 1, which is option B.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but the conditions here suggest a possible substitution or elimination mechanism.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   NaNH₂ in ammonia can act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom with an amide group (NH₂). This would result in the formation of 1-amino-2-d benzene. Bromobenzene is typically deactivated towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but under strong basic conditions, substitution is plausible. This would yield a single product.

2. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   Elimination reactions often require two adjacent leaving groups to form a triple bond (benzyne). However, the starting material has only one bromine atom and a deuterium atom, which is not sufficient for elimination. Additionally, deuterium is not a good leaving group, making elimination unlikely.

3. **Other Possibilities**:  
   The reaction could theoretically involve deprotonation of the ring, but the acidic protons ortho to bromine are less reactive due to the deactivating nature of bromine. Furthermore, the presence of deuterium complicates the reaction, as it is less reactive than hydrogen. No evidence suggests that the reaction would proceed via ring contraction, expansion, or dearomatization under these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reaction is substitution, where bromine is replaced by an amide group, yielding a single product: 1-amino-2-d benzene. No other plausible reaction pathways (such as elimination or rearrangement) are supported by the given conditions. Therefore, only one product is formed.
