Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an unknown organic, and the 1H NMR data is given. The options are four different types of acetates: either propenyl or butenyl, and cis or trans in each case. So I need to figure out which structure matches the NMR spectrum.

First, let's write down the NMR data: 

- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, a doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

Hmm, okay. So I'm looking at an acetate, so the structure is probably something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, more likely an ester. Wait, acetate ester would be like R-O-CO-OAc? No, wait, wait. Acetate esters are typically like R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So the structure would be an ester where the acid part is acetic acid. So the formula is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Oh right, because acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the ester would replace the -OH with an OR group. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-CH3.

So the compound is an acyloxy compound, where the acyl group is acetyl (two carbons), and the OR group is an alkene or alkyne? Wait, propenyl or butenyl suggests double bonds. So the OR group is an allyl type.

So the possible structures are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and the configuration is cis or trans. So, let's think about the structures.

Propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2? Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-... Wait, propenyl groups are CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-O-? Or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond somewhere else. Wait, wait. Let's clarify:

Propenyl group: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. But the options are Cis or Trans, which suggests that the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in a certain way. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Oh, but in terms of the structure, the ester would have the oxygen connected to the CH2 group.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but perhaps it's more about substituents around the double bond.

Wait, but the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but how can propenyl be cis or trans? Propenyl has only one double bond, so maybe the substituents on either side are the same, making it not geometric isomerizable. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Wait, maybe the propenyl group is part of a larger structure where the double bond is in a position that allows for cis and trans isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the structure in question is something like CH2=CHCH2OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2=CHCH2OAc (same as above). Alternatively, butenyl has four carbons, so the acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but wait, butenyl can have the double bond in different positions. For example, 1-propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, 2-propenyl is CH2CH=CH2-, but wait, but for butenyl, the double bond can be in position 1 or 2.

Wait, perhaps the structures are:

Cis-propenyl acetate: CH2=CH-OAc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. In that case, the substituents on either side are CH2CH2OAc and a hydrogen. But wait, in that case, there's no possibility for cis or trans isomerism because the substituents on either side of the double bond are not both different groups. So maybe that's why propenyl can't have cis and trans isomers. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the propenyl group is actually part of a larger structure where the double bond is between two carbons that each have two different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an acetate ester but an acetylenic compound. No, the options mention propenyl and butenyl, so they're alkenes.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data.

Looking at the given data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a relatively upfield shift, but wait, in alkenes, protons can be in the 5-6 ppm region, but aromatic protons are typically higher, like 7 ppm. Wait, but some vinyl protons can be upfield or downfield depending on substitution.

Wait, wait, wait. The NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm. That's in the aromatic region, but the compound is an acetate ester of propenyl or butenyl. So maybe that's not an aromatic proton but perhaps a vinylic proton. Hmm, but I thought vinylic protons are usually lower than 6.5 ppm. Unless there's some ring current effect, but that's more for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is a deshielded proton, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group like oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the 7.0 ppm peak could be a proton that's next to an ester group, like in a conjugated system, which could cause it to be upfield or downfield? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the other peaks: 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a complex multiplet, perhaps due to coupling with multiple neighboring protons. The 2.1 ppm singlet is probably the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (the acetyl group, OAc). The 1.6 ppm doublet is maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or next to a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the structure. So the molecule is an acetate ester, so it's R-O-CO-CH3. The R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and the configuration is cis or trans.

So the R group is an allyl group (propenyl) or a butenyl group (butenyl). The NMR will show the protons in the R group.

So let's imagine the R group is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, in that case, the two protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, maybe the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Or CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond position affects the splitting.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a triplet? No, wait, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a more complex splitting. So perhaps the proton at 5.5 is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to multiple peaks.

Also, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests that the protons are trans to each other in a double bond (i.e., a trans coupling). Wait, but J is usually higher for trans coupling in alkenes. For example, in a trans alkene, the coupling between the two protons on either end is larger, about 16 Hz. So that suggests the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

Wait, but 7.0 ppm is quite upfield for a vinylic proton. Typically, vinylic protons are in the 5-6 ppm range. Unless there's some conjugation or electronegative group nearby causing deshielding.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene, but that's more of a butenyl group. Let's think about butenyl acetate. Let's say it's (Z) or (E) butenyl.

Wait, but the options are between propenyl and butenyl, so perhaps the NMR can help determine the structure.

Let's consider the 7.0 ppm peak. If that's a vinylic proton, perhaps it's part of a trans double bond, implying a trans configuration. Alternatively, if it's an aromatic proton, but that would suggest a benzene ring, which is not part of the acetate ester, but the compound is listed as either propenyl or butenyl acetate, so no aromatic groups.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is part of a conjugated system, making it more deshielded. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's propenyl. Alternatively, in butenyl, perhaps a di-substituted double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the integration. The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, which suggests only one proton in that environment. Similarly, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, the 2.1 ppm is 3H (so a singlet, likely the methyl group of the acetyl), and 1.6 ppm is another 3H, a doublet.

So, for the R group (the alkyl part of the ester), it's a propenyl or butenyl group, so let's model the structures.

Let's model the possible structures:

Case 1: Propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 (the CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. The structure would have:

- The CH2 group next to the double bond: H2C=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but in that case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH part. Wait, but the ester oxygen is on the CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. No, the propenyl group is O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2. No, that would make it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group.

In that structure, the first carbon (attached to O) is CH2, then a double bond to CH, then another CH2.

So the protons on the double bond would be on the CH and the adjacent CH2.

Wait, the H on the CH (from CH2=CH-) would be a vinylic proton. So the possible splitting would be as follows.

The H on CH2= would couple with the H on CH (next to the double bond). Let's see:

So, the CH would have two protons on either side? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2: O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, it's an ester, so it's O-CO-OCH3 as the acetate. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is acetyl (CH3CO-). So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. The acetate ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, the acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl, R is CH2=CHCH2-.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Now, the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would have the double bond between the first and second carbon of the propenyl chain.

So, the protons on the double bond would be on the CH2 and CH groups.

Wait, but in CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, the CH2=CH- part would have the double bond. So the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one? Or wait, no: CH2=CHCH2- implies that the first CH2 is connected to the O, then the double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl part is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH3 attached to a propenyl group. So the propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

In that structure, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be on the CH2 groups.

So, the H on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent vinylic H.

Wait, but in that structure, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So, the CH2 adjacent to the O has two protons, the CH has one proton, and the CH2 at the end has two protons. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-...

So, the middle CH is connected to the CH2 on one side and the double bond on the other. So the middle CH has one proton. The CH2 groups on either end (the first CH2 and the last CH2) each have two protons.

So, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (the CH2=CH part) would be next to the CH which has one proton.

Wait, perhaps the coupling between the CH2 and the CH.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So that's a large coupling, which suggests that the proton is trans to another proton across a double bond. So, that would suggest that the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton that's coupled with another vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

Wait, so if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3 (propenyl acetate), then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH parts. Wait, the CH part has only one proton, and the CH2 next to it has two.

So the CH proton (on the double bond) would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. So the coupling between the CH proton and the CH2 protons would be J around maybe 6-8 Hz. But the given J is 16 Hz, which is higher. That suggests a trans coupling across a double bond, not just adjacent coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the 7.0 ppm peak is a proton that's across a double bond from another proton, leading to a trans coupling. So in a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that would be a vinyl group attached directly to the oxygen. Wait, but that's not possible because the oxygen can't form a double bond and a single bond to the same carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Then, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the vinylic protons are on the first and second carbons. The first carbon (connected to O) has two H's, and the second has one H.

So the H on the second carbon (CH) would be coupled with the H on the first carbon (CH2). But the coupling between the CH and the adjacent CH2 would be around 6-8 Hz, perhaps. But the given J is 16 Hz, which is more typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the structure is butenyl acetate, so four carbons in the R group.

Let's model the butenyl group. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3 (butenyl acetate). But the double bond can be in different positions. For example, 1,2-diene: CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, or 2,3-diene: CH2CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the arrangement around the double bond. So in 1,2-diene, the substituents are CH2O and CH2CH2O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3 (butenyl). Then, the protons on the double bond would be at CH2= and CH-. So the CH has one H, and the adjacent CH2 has two H.

In this case, the H on the CH would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But the given data shows a doublet at 7 ppm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. So that's a large coupling, likely between two vinylic protons across a trans double bond.

So if the molecule has a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, and their coupling would be large, around 16 Hz. So each proton would be a doublet, each coupling with the other.

So in the structure, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is at 7.0 ppm and another is at a different ppm, but the given data only shows one H at 7.0 and another at 5.5, which is a dq.

Wait, the data shows two different protons: one at 7.0 (d, J=16), and another at 5.5 (dq). So maybe the structure has two sets of vinylic protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a butenyl group with a double bond in the middle, such as CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's more for 1,3-dienes.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the CH2=CH part would have the vinylic protons. The CH2 next to the double bond (C2) would have two H's, and the CH (C1) would have one H.

So, the H on C1 (CH) would couple with the H's on C2 (CH2), giving a triplet for the CH H. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the coupling constants.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests it's coupled with one proton. So perhaps that's the vinylic proton on one end of the double bond, and the other vinylic proton is on the same carbon as another H. Wait, no, because each end of the double bond can have one or more H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each end of the double bond has one H, and these two H's are trans to each other. So each would be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR, only one peak is observed for this proton, perhaps due to symmetry or splitting patterns.

Wait, but the data shows only one H at 7.0 ppm, so perhaps that's the only H in that environment. So perhaps the other H is either not present or in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H at 7.0 is adjacent to an electronegative group, causing a downfield shift.

Wait, another thought: the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That suggests that the proton is coupled with two different sets of H's, possibly two neighboring groups. For example, a CH that is next to a CH2 and a CH3, leading to splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H at 5.5 is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to another CH2 and a CH group.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. So the butenyl group has a cis double bond. Structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in a cis configuration. Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's butenyl with the double bond between C2 and C3. So in the cis configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Now, the protons on the double bond would be on C2 and C3. So C2 has two H's, and C3 has two H's, but wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and has one H each? Maybe not. Let me model it.

Wait, butenyl would be four carbons. So for cis-butenyl, the structure might be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, but that's actually a 2-pentene structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this structure, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled with the H's on C1 (CH2). So the H on C2 would be a triplet due to coupling with two H's on C1. But the given data shows a 5.5 ppm as dq, which is a more complex splitting. Hmm.

Alternatively, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be 2-pentene attached to OAc. So the structure would be CH2CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the double bond is between C2 and C3. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. So the H's on C2 (CH2) would be split by the H's on C3 (CH2). But wait, in that case, the H's on C2 would be next to a double bond. So their coupling would be with the H on C3, which is a CH.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond in the middle, leading to a CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-OAc structure. But that would be a trans or cis configuration.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the integration and the splitting.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, so only one proton. The 5.5 ppm is 1H. The 2.1 ppm is 3H (likely the acetyl methyl group), and the 1.6 ppm is 3H (doublet).

The 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H suggests that this H is next to a CH2 group with two H's. So perhaps it's a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which in turn is attached to something else.

So, for example, a structure like CH2CH2CH3, where the CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2. But with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a branch, which isn't the case here. Or maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to outline the possibilities.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the double bond is trans. Wait, but in a propenyl group, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is a trans configuration if it's across the double bond. But wait, propenyl only has three carbons, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, but how can that be trans? Because each carbon (C1 and C2) would have two substituents. For example, C1 is connected to OAc-O-CH2 and a CH2, while C2 is connected to CH2 and a H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's not possible because that would make the double bond between O and C, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In that structure, the H on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C1) would be two H's, and the H on the CH (C2) would be one H.

So, the H on C2 (CH) would couple with the H's on C1 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm and a dq at 5.5 ppm. So that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond in a different position. Wait, but that's not propenyl.

Hmm, perhaps the key is in the splitting at 5.5 ppm.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq (doublet of quadruplets). That suggests that the proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant. So maybe it's a CH group that's adjacent to two different types of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the H on the CH would be split into a dq due to coupling with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet with 3H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. So perhaps the CH3 is attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that would be a branched structure, which isn't among the options.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of the options.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on either side of the double bond in a cis arrangement. But wait, in a propenyl group, how can the substituents be cis? The substituents would be CH2OAc and H on one end, and CH2 and H on the other. So maybe the cis refers to the arrangement of the groups on either side, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure would have a trans double bond in the butenyl group. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in a trans configuration, but with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents on either end in a trans configuration.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should compare the NMR data with each possible structure.

Let's take each option and predict the NMR.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration (double bond between C2 and C3). So the groups on either end of the double bond are on the same side.

The protons on C2 and C3 would each have two H's. Because it's cis, the substituents are on the same side.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would couple with the H on C3 (CH2). So each H on C2 would be a quartet due to coupling with two H on C3, and vice versa. But wait, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the double bond and thus vinylic.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, no, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is a butenyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the configuration is cis. But in that case, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be CH2CH2-OAc on one end and H on the other. So, the substituents are on the same side (cis), but I'm not sure how that affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's a trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider the number of peaks and their coupling.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (d) with J=16 Hz: perhaps this is a vinylic proton coupled with another vinylic proton across the double bond. So each would be a doublet, but in the NMR, only one is observed. That suggests that perhaps the other proton is in a different environment or integrated with other peaks.

The 5.5 ppm dq: this proton is coupled with two sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH that's next to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 2.1 ppm s: the acetyl methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm d: a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but that's a branched structure, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but with the double bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the H on C3 (the CH part) would be coupled with the H's on C2 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the given data shows a doublet at 7.0 and a dq at 5.5, so perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). Then, the CH on C2 would be coupled with the two H's on C1 (CH2), giving a triplet. But in the data, 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another angle: the downfield shift at 7.0 ppm. Could that be due to conjugation with the ester group? For instance, the vinylic proton being adjacent to the ester oxygen, causing a downfield shift.

So, the structure would have a vinylic proton next to the ester O.

For example, O-CO-CH3 is the ester group, attached to a CH2, which is part of a double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because the oxygen can't have a double bond to the CH2 and a single bond to the ester.

Wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, so the R group is the propenyl or butenyl. So the R is attached to the oxygen, which is part of the ester.

So, for example, if R is CH2=CHCH2-, then the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this structure, the H on the CH (C2) would be next to the CH2 (C1) which is attached to the O. The H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0, so perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, but the H on C2 would be vinylic. So its chemical shift would be around 5-6 ppm. But in the data, it's at 7.0, which is higher. That suggests maybe another effect, like conjugation with the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the vinylic proton is adjacent to the ester group, causing a downfield shift. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that's not possible because the O would have a double bond to the CH2 and a single bond to the ester, which isn't feasible. So the structure must have the double bond in a position where the vinylic H is adjacent to the ester O.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-O-CO-CH3 connected to a double bond. But that would be O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3.

In this case, the H on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the CH2 (C1) and the CH2 (C3). So the H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1, giving a triplet. But again, the data shows a doublet.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let's think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, the options are either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans.

Let me think about the number of vinylic protons in each case.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The vinylic protons are on the CH (C2), so one H. So in the NMR, only that H would appear as a vinylic peak.

But in the given data, there's a 7.0 ppm (1H) and a 5.5 ppm (1H). So perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons. But propenyl only has one.

Wait, that's a key point. Propenyl has only one vinylic proton, while butenyl would have two. So the presence of two vinylic protons in the NMR data suggests that the molecule is butenyl, not propenyl.

Because the data shows two vinylic protons (7.0 and 5.5), but wait, no. The data shows two separate peaks, but perhaps they're from the same double bond, each with one H.

Wait, but if it's propenyl, only one vinylic H. So the data showing two peaks would suggest butenyl.

But the data shows two separate H's: 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq). So if the structure is butenyl, which has two vinylic H's, each as a doublet, then perhaps the 7.0 is one and the 5.5 is the other.

But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet with J=16. So that would match a trans coupling between two vinylic H's. The other would be at 5.5, which is a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, but in a trans configuration, both vinylic H's would be trans and thus each would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz. However, the data shows only one H at 7.0, so perhaps the other is at 5.5, but why the different coupling?

Alternatively, perhaps one vinylic H is coupled with another H, and the other vinylic H is coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C1 and C2. Then, the vinylic H on C1 (CH2) would have two H's, and the vinylic H on C2 (CH) would have one H. But that would give two different vinylic H's: one as a triplet (coupled to two H's on C1) and another as a doublet (coupled to two H's on C3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C2 and C3. Then, each end of the double bond has two H's. So the H's on C2 and C3 would each be coupled with each other, leading to doublets.

So in this case, the two vinylic H's would each be a doublet, and their chemical shifts would be around 5.5 and 5.8, perhaps. But in the data, one is at 7.0 and the other at 5.5.

Wait, but the 7.0 is significantly downfield. Maybe that's due to conjugation with the ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but with the double bond in a position that one of the vinylic H's is conjugated with the ester.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let's consider the integration and coupling again.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. So it's a vinylic H coupled with another H across the double bond (trans), giving J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm peak is 1H, dq. So that H is coupled with two different sets of H's, perhaps two different neighbors.

The 1.6 ppm peak is 3H, doublet, so it's a CH3 next to a CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). The vinylic H is at 7.0 (d, J=16), and the adjacent CH2's H's are at 5.5 (dq). But wait, the propenyl group only has one vinylic H. So in the structure, the H on the CH would be at 7.0, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's, which would be split by the CH H, giving a triplet. But the data shows a dq, so perhaps the CH2 is also coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. So, a branch at C2, making it isopropyl-like, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's an allyl ester, not propenyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the coupling constants.

In a trans double bond, the J between the two vinylic H's is around 16 Hz. So the 7.0 ppm H is coupled with another H across the double bond, giving a doublet with J=16.

The other vinylic H would be at another ppm, perhaps 5.5, but in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a doublet. So perhaps that suggests that the 5.5 H is coupled with more than one H.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 H is a CH that's next to a CH2 group (coupling with two H's) and also next to another CH group (coupling with one H), leading to a doublet of quadruplets. That could explain the dq.

So, for example, a structure like CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that's five carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). The vinylic H is at 7.0, and the adjacent CH2's H's are coupled with it, leading to a triplet. But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl). The vinylic H's are on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be a triplet due to coupling with the H on C2 (CH), and the H on C2 (CH) would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C1 (CH2). But that doesn't match the data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl). So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H's on C2 and C3 are each two H's. Each would couple with the other, leading to a triplet for each. But the data shows different patterns.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the 5.5 peak is not a vinylic H but an allylic H. Allylic H's are adjacent to the double bond and can show coupling with the vinylic H's. So in that case, the 5.5 peak would be an allylic H, coupled with the vinylic H (J=6-8 Hz), and also coupled with adjacent H's, leading to a dq.

But the 7.0 peak would then be the vinylic H, coupled with the allylic H, giving a doublet.

So, for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the vinylic H is on the CH, and the adjacent CH2 has two H's. The H's on the CH2 would be allylic and coupled with the vinylic H, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a dq at 5.5.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is more complex. Maybe the CH2 next to the double bond is also adjacent to another CH2, leading to more coupling.

Let me think about the options again. The options are either propenyl or butenyl, cis or trans.

If the structure is propenyl, then there's only one vinylic H. But the NMR shows two vinylic H's (7.0 and 5.5), which suggests it's butenyl.

So, focusing on the options A and D (butenyl), which are cis and trans.

In a trans double bond, the two vinylic H's are on opposite sides and would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In the data, the 7.0 is a doublet (J=16), and the 5.5 is a dq. So perhaps the 5.5 is a vinylic H coupled with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is an allylic H, not a vinylic one.

Wait, another approach: the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's split into two by one coupling and into four by another. So perhaps it's a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

Looking at the 1.6 ppm peak: 3H doublet. That suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group. So the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but that's a saturated structure. So perhaps it's CH3-CH2-CH=CH-OAc.

Wait, but that's a propenyl group? No, that's butenyl. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In that case, the vinylic H's would be on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be coupled with the H on C2 (CH), leading to a triplet. The H on C2 would be a doublet due to coupling with C1. But the data shows a doublet and a dq.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should make a table of each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis configuration, but for propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so cis would mean the substituents on each end are on the same side). But since propenyl has only one vinylic H, the NMR would show that H as a doublet if coupled with adjacent H's.

But in the data, there are two vinylic H's, which suggests butenyl.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, trans configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on each end are trans.

The vinylic H's would be on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be coupled with the H on C2 (CH), leading to a triplet for C1 and a doublet for C2. But in the data, 7.0 is a doublet, and 5.5 is a dq.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the trans configuration leads to the vinylic H's being on opposite sides. So each would be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But the data shows one at 7.0 and another at 5.5.

Alternatively, the 7.0 is one vinylic H, and the 5.5 is an allylic H, coupled with the vinylic H.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), and the 7.0 is the vinylic H, and the 5.5 is the adjacent CH2 H's, which are split into a dq due to coupling with the vinylic H and another group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a methine (CH) group adjacent to a double bond and a CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. The CH2 at the end (C4) has a CH3 attached? No, because that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that's a branch, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's an allyl group, not propenyl.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a different approach. Let's look at the downfield shifts.

The 7.0 ppm is a vinylic H downfield, which suggests it's conjugated with something electronegative, like the ester group.

So, perhaps the vinylic H is adjacent to the ester oxygen, causing the downfield shift.

In that case, the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that's not possible because the O can't form a double bond to both the CH2 and the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-O-CO-CH3 connected to a CH=CH2 group. So, CH2-O-CO-CH3-CH=CH2. But that would be a longer chain, perhaps butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. In this case, the vinylic H on the CH is adjacent to the ester O, causing a downfield shift. So that H would be around 7.0 ppm, which matches the data.

Then, the adjacent CH2 would have two H's, which would be coupled with the vinylic H, giving a triplet. But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. The vinylic H (on CH) is at 7.0 (d, J=16), and the adjacent CH2's H's are at 5.5 (dq), perhaps coupled with another group.

Wait, but the CH2 would have two H's, so their signal would be a triplet due to coupling with the vinylic H. But the data shows a single H at 5.5 as a dq, which suggests it's a CH group, not a CH2.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, but that would mean the adjacent CH2 has two H's, which would be a triplet, not a dq.

Wait, another possibility: the 5.5 peak is a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. For example, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CO-CH3, but that's a branched structure, not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, and the 5.5 peak is the CH2 group next to the double bond. But the CH2 would have two H's, leading to a triplet.

I'm stuck again. Let me try to summarize what each option's NMR might look like.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Only one vinylic H (on CH), so NMR would show that as a doublet (coupled with adjacent CH2 H's), perhaps around 5.8 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be a triplet. But the data has a 7.0 ppm, which is higher, so maybe not.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, trans configuration. The vinylic H's would be on CH2 and CH. The CH2 H's would be a triplet, and the CH H would be a doublet. But the data has 7.0 and 5.5, which may not match.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, cis. The vinylic H's on CH2 and CH would be coupled, but their shifts might be around 5.5 and 5.8.

But the data shows 7.0 and 5.5, which is higher than typical.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. But I'm not sure how a propenyl can be trans. It would have the double bond between C1 and C2, but with substituents on the same side. But propenyl would have only one vinylic H, so the NMR would show that as a doublet, perhaps around 5.8.

But the data shows two vinylic H's, which suggests it's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have two vinylic H's as doublets. So the 7.0 would be one and the 5.5 would be the other.

But why is the 5.5 a dq?

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 is a CH group next to a CH2 and another group. For example, in the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, the H on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 (double bond), leading to coupling with the vinylic H and also with the CH2 on C4, resulting in a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is an allylic H, which is coupled with the vinylic H and another group, leading to the dq.

But I'm not entirely confident. Based on the data, the presence of a 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 suggests a trans configuration, and a butenyl group would have two vinylic H's, so options A and D are butenyl.

Between A (cis) and D (trans), which would have the vinylic H's at higher ppm?

In a trans configuration, the vinylic H's would be more deshielded due to the trans arrangement, leading to higher ppm shifts. So the 7.0 would be one trans vinylic H, and the other at around 5.5.

So, the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Structure**:  
   The compound is an acetate ester, meaning it has the general structure **R-O-CO-CH3**, where **R** is either a propenyl or butenyl group. The options specify whether the double bond in the R group is cis or trans.

2. **NMR Data Interpretation**:  
   - The **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** peak indicates a vinylic proton coupled with another vinylic proton across a double bond. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) suggests a trans configuration.  
   - The **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** peak is a doublet of quadruplets, likely due to a proton coupled with two different sets of protons. This suggests an allylic or vinylic proton in a specific environment.  
   - The **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** peak corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group (**CH3** in **COCH3**).  
   - The **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** peak corresponds to a methyl group (**CH3**) attached to a CH2 group.

3. **Differentiating Propenyl and Butenyl**:  
   - A **propenyl group** (CH2=CHCH2-) has only one vinylic proton, which would appear as a doublet in the NMR. However, the data shows two distinct vinylic peaks (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a **butenyl group** (CH2=CHCH2CH2-), which has two vinylic protons.  
   - This eliminates options **B (Trans-propenyl acetate)** and **C (Cis-propenyl acetate)**.

4. **Cis vs. Trans Butenyl**:  
   - In a **cis-butenyl group**, the vinylic protons are on the same side of the double bond, leading to smaller coupling constants and chemical shifts closer to 5-6 ppm.  
   - In a **trans-butenyl group**, the vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, resulting in a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and one of the peaks appearing at a higher chemical shift (7.0 ppm).  
   - The data matches the **trans-butenyl configuration**, with the 7.0 ppm peak corresponding to one vinylic proton and the 5.5 ppm peak corresponding to the other, which is coupled with additional protons (hence the dq).

### Conclusion:
The NMR data supports the structure of **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it accounts for the two vinylic protons, their coupling constants, and the observed splitting patterns.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an unknown organic, and the 1H NMR data is given. The options are four different types of acetates: either propenyl or butenyl, and cis or trans in each case. So I need to figure out which structure matches the NMR spectrum.

First, let's write down the NMR data: 

- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, a doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

Hmm, okay. So I'm looking at an acetate, so the structure is probably something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, more likely an ester. Wait, acetate ester would be like R-O-CO-OAc? No, wait, wait. Acetate esters are typically like R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So the structure would be an ester where the acid part is acetic acid. So the formula is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Oh right, because acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the ester would replace the -OH with an OR group. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-CH3.

So the compound is an acyloxy compound, where the acyl group is acetyl (two carbons), and the OR group is an alkene or alkyne? Wait, propenyl or butenyl suggests double bonds. So the OR group is an allyl type.

So the possible structures are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and the configuration is cis or trans. So, let's think about the structures.

Propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2? Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-... Wait, propenyl groups are CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-O-? Or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond somewhere else. Wait, wait. Let's clarify:

Propenyl group: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. But the options are Cis or Trans, which suggests that the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in a certain way. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Oh, but in terms of the structure, the ester would have the oxygen connected to the CH2 group.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but perhaps it's more about substituents around the double bond.

Wait, but the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but how can propenyl be cis or trans? Propenyl has only one double bond, so maybe the substituents on either side are the same, making it not geometric isomerizable. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Wait, maybe the propenyl group is part of a larger structure where the double bond is in a position that allows for cis and trans isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the structure in question is something like CH2=CHCH2OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2=CHCH2OAc (same as above). Alternatively, butenyl has four carbons, so the acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but wait, butenyl can have the double bond in different positions. For example, 1-propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, 2-propenyl is CH2CH=CH2-, but wait, but for butenyl, the double bond can be in position 1 or 2.

Wait, perhaps the structures are:

Cis-propenyl acetate: CH2=CH-OAc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. In that case, the substituents on either side are CH2CH2OAc and a hydrogen. But wait, in that case, there's no possibility for cis or trans isomerism because the substituents on either side of the double bond are not both different groups. So maybe that's why propenyl can't have cis and trans isomers. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the propenyl group is actually part of a larger structure where the double bond is between two carbons that each have two different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an acetate ester but an acetylenic compound. No, the options mention propenyl and butenyl, so they're alkenes.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data.

Looking at the given data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a relatively upfield shift, but wait, in alkenes, protons can be in the 5-6 ppm region, but aromatic protons are typically higher, like 7 ppm. Wait, but some vinyl protons can be upfield or downfield depending on substitution.

Wait, wait, wait. The NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm. That's in the aromatic region, but the compound is an acetate ester of propenyl or butenyl. So maybe that's not an aromatic proton but perhaps a vinylic proton. Hmm, but I thought vinylic protons are usually lower than 6.5 ppm. Unless there's some ring current effect, but that's more for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is a deshielded proton, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group like oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the 7.0 ppm peak could be a proton that's next to an ester group, like in a conjugated system, which could cause it to be upfield or downfield? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the other peaks: 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a complex multiplet, perhaps due to coupling with multiple neighboring protons. The 2.1 ppm singlet is probably the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (the acetyl group, OAc). The 1.6 ppm doublet is maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or next to a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the structure. So the molecule is an acetate ester, so it's R-O-CO-CH3. The R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and the configuration is cis or trans.

So the R group is an allyl group (propenyl) or a butenyl group (butenyl). The NMR will show the protons in the R group.

So let's imagine the R group is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, in that case, the two protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, maybe the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Or CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond position affects the splitting.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a triplet? No, wait, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a more complex splitting. So perhaps the proton at 5.5 is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to multiple peaks.

Also, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests that the protons are trans to each other in a double bond (i.e., a trans coupling). Wait, but J is usually higher for trans coupling in alkenes. For example, in a trans alkene, the coupling between the two protons on either end is larger, about 16 Hz. So that suggests the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

Wait, but 7.0 ppm is quite upfield for a vinylic proton. Typically, vinylic protons are in the 5-6 ppm range. Unless there's some conjugation or electronegative group nearby causing deshielding.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene, but that's more of a butenyl group. Let's think about butenyl acetate. Let's say it's (Z) or (E) butenyl.

Wait, but the options are between propenyl and butenyl, so perhaps the NMR can help determine the structure.

Let's consider the 7.0 ppm peak. If that's a vinylic proton, perhaps it's part of a trans double bond, implying a trans configuration. Alternatively, if it's an aromatic proton, but that would suggest a benzene ring, which is not part of the acetate ester, but the compound is listed as either propenyl or butenyl acetate, so no aromatic groups.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is part of a conjugated system, making it more deshielded. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's propenyl. Alternatively, in butenyl, perhaps a di-substituted double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the integration. The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, which suggests only one proton in that environment. Similarly, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, the 2.1 ppm is 3H (so a singlet, likely the methyl group of the acetyl), and 1.6 ppm is another 3H, a doublet.

So, for the R group (the alkyl part of the ester), it's a propenyl or butenyl group, so let's model the structures.

Let's model the possible structures:

Case 1: Propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 (the CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. The structure would have:

- The CH2 group next to the double bond: H2C=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but in that case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH part. Wait, but the ester oxygen is on the CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. No, the propenyl group is O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2. No, that would make it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group.

In that structure, the first carbon (attached to O) is CH2, then a double bond to CH, then another CH2.

So the protons on the double bond would be on the CH and the adjacent CH2.

Wait, the H on the CH (from CH2=CH-) would be a vinylic proton. So the possible splitting would be as follows.

The H on CH2= would couple with the H on CH (next to the double bond). Let's see:

So, the CH would have two protons on either side? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2: O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, it's an ester, so it's O-CO-OCH3 as the acetate. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is acetyl (CH3CO-). So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. The acetate ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, the acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl, R is CH2=CHCH2-.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Now, the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would have the double bond between the first and second carbon of the propenyl chain.

So, the protons on the double bond would be on the CH2 and CH groups.

Wait, but in CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, the CH2=CH- part would have the double bond. So the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one? Or wait, no: CH2=CHCH2- implies that the first CH2 is connected to the O, then the double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl part is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH3 attached to a propenyl group. So the propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

In that structure, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be on the CH2 groups.

So, the H on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent vinylic H.

Wait, but in that structure, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So, the CH2 adjacent to the O has two protons, the CH has one proton, and the CH2 at the end has two protons. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-...

So, the middle CH is connected to the CH2 on one side and the double bond on the other. So the middle CH has one proton. The CH2 groups on either end (the first CH2 and the last CH2) each have two protons.

So, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (the CH2=CH part) would be next to the CH which has one proton.

Wait, perhaps the coupling between the CH2 and the CH.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So that's a large coupling, which suggests that the proton is trans to another proton across a double bond. So, that would suggest that the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton that's coupled with another vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

Wait, so if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3 (propenyl acetate), then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 and the CH parts. Wait, the CH part has only one proton, and the CH2 next to it has two.

So the CH proton (on the double bond) would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. So the coupling between the CH proton and the CH2 protons would be J around maybe 6-8 Hz. But the given J is 16 Hz, which is higher. That suggests a trans coupling across a double bond, not just adjacent coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the 7.0 ppm peak is a proton that's across a double bond from another proton, leading to a trans coupling. So in a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that would be a vinyl group attached directly to the oxygen. Wait, but that's not possible because the oxygen can't form a double bond and a single bond to the same carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Then, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the vinylic protons are on the first and second carbons. The first carbon (connected to O) has two H's, and the second has one H.

So the H on the second carbon (CH) would be coupled with the H on the first carbon (CH2). But the coupling between the CH and the adjacent CH2 would be around 6-8 Hz, perhaps. But the given J is 16 Hz, which is more typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the structure is butenyl acetate, so four carbons in the R group.

Let's model the butenyl group. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3 (butenyl acetate). But the double bond can be in different positions. For example, 1,2-diene: CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, or 2,3-diene: CH2CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the arrangement around the double bond. So in 1,2-diene, the substituents are CH2O and CH2CH2O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3 (butenyl). Then, the protons on the double bond would be at CH2= and CH-. So the CH has one H, and the adjacent CH2 has two H.

In this case, the H on the CH would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But the given data shows a doublet at 7 ppm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. So that's a large coupling, likely between two vinylic protons across a trans double bond.

So if the molecule has a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, and their coupling would be large, around 16 Hz. So each proton would be a doublet, each coupling with the other.

So in the structure, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is at 7.0 ppm and another is at a different ppm, but the given data only shows one H at 7.0 and another at 5.5, which is a dq.

Wait, the data shows two different protons: one at 7.0 (d, J=16), and another at 5.5 (dq). So maybe the structure has two sets of vinylic protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a butenyl group with a double bond in the middle, such as CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's more for 1,3-dienes.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the CH2=CH part would have the vinylic protons. The CH2 next to the double bond (C2) would have two H's, and the CH (C1) would have one H.

So, the H on C1 (CH) would couple with the H's on C2 (CH2), giving a triplet for the CH H. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the coupling constants.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests it's coupled with one proton. So perhaps that's the vinylic proton on one end of the double bond, and the other vinylic proton is on the same carbon as another H. Wait, no, because each end of the double bond can have one or more H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each end of the double bond has one H, and these two H's are trans to each other. So each would be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR, only one peak is observed for this proton, perhaps due to symmetry or splitting patterns.

Wait, but the data shows only one H at 7.0 ppm, so perhaps that's the only H in that environment. So perhaps the other H is either not present or in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H at 7.0 is adjacent to an electronegative group, causing a downfield shift.

Wait, another thought: the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That suggests that the proton is coupled with two different sets of H's, possibly two neighboring groups. For example, a CH that is next to a CH2 and a CH3, leading to splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H at 5.5 is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to another CH2 and a CH group.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. So the butenyl group has a cis double bond. Structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in a cis configuration. Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's butenyl with the double bond between C2 and C3. So in the cis configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Now, the protons on the double bond would be on C2 and C3. So C2 has two H's, and C3 has two H's, but wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and has one H each? Maybe not. Let me model it.

Wait, butenyl would be four carbons. So for cis-butenyl, the structure might be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, but that's actually a 2-pentene structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this structure, the H on C2 (CH) would be coupled with the H's on C1 (CH2). So the H on C2 would be a triplet due to coupling with two H's on C1. But the given data shows a 5.5 ppm as dq, which is a more complex splitting. Hmm.

Alternatively, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be 2-pentene attached to OAc. So the structure would be CH2CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the double bond is between C2 and C3. Then, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. So the H's on C2 (CH2) would be split by the H's on C3 (CH2). But wait, in that case, the H's on C2 would be next to a double bond. So their coupling would be with the H on C3, which is a CH.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond in the middle, leading to a CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-OAc structure. But that would be a trans or cis configuration.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the integration and the splitting.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, so only one proton. The 5.5 ppm is 1H. The 2.1 ppm is 3H (likely the acetyl methyl group), and the 1.6 ppm is 3H (doublet).

The 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H suggests that this H is next to a CH2 group with two H's. So perhaps it's a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which in turn is attached to something else.

So, for example, a structure like CH2CH2CH3, where the CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2. But with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a branch, which isn't the case here. Or maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to outline the possibilities.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the double bond is trans. Wait, but in a propenyl group, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is a trans configuration if it's across the double bond. But wait, propenyl only has three carbons, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, but how can that be trans? Because each carbon (C1 and C2) would have two substituents. For example, C1 is connected to OAc-O-CH2 and a CH2, while C2 is connected to CH2 and a H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's not possible because that would make the double bond between O and C, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In that structure, the H on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C1) would be two H's, and the H on the CH (C2) would be one H.

So, the H on C2 (CH) would couple with the H's on C1 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm and a dq at 5.5 ppm. So that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond in a different position. Wait, but that's not propenyl.

Hmm, perhaps the key is in the splitting at 5.5 ppm.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq (doublet of quadruplets). That suggests that the proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant. So maybe it's a CH group that's adjacent to two different types of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the H on the CH would be split into a dq due to coupling with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet with 3H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. So perhaps the CH3 is attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that would be a branched structure, which isn't among the options.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of the options.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on either side of the double bond in a cis arrangement. But wait, in a propenyl group, how can the substituents be cis? The substituents would be CH2OAc and H on one end, and CH2 and H on the other. So maybe the cis refers to the arrangement of the groups on either side, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure would have a trans double bond in the butenyl group. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in a trans configuration, but with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents on either end in a trans configuration.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should compare the NMR data with each possible structure.

Let's take each option and predict the NMR.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, cis configuration (double bond between C2 and C3). So the groups on either end of the double bond are on the same side.

The protons on C2 and C3 would each have two H's. Because it's cis, the substituents are on the same side.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would couple with the H on C3 (CH2). So each H on C2 would be a quartet due to coupling with two H on C3, and vice versa. But wait, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the double bond and thus vinylic.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, no, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is a butenyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the configuration is cis. But in that case, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be CH2CH2-OAc on one end and H on the other. So, the substituents are on the same side (cis), but I'm not sure how that affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's a trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider the number of peaks and their coupling.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (d) with J=16 Hz: perhaps this is a vinylic proton coupled with another vinylic proton across the double bond. So each would be a doublet, but in the NMR, only one is observed. That suggests that perhaps the other proton is in a different environment or integrated with other peaks.

The 5.5 ppm dq: this proton is coupled with two sets of protons. Maybe it's a CH that's next to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 2.1 ppm s: the acetyl methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm d: a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but that's a branched structure, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but with the double bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the H on C3 (the CH part) would be coupled with the H's on C2 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But the given data shows a doublet at 7.0 and a dq at 5.5, so perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). Then, the CH on C2 would be coupled with the two H's on C1 (CH2), giving a triplet. But in the data, 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another angle: the downfield shift at 7.0 ppm. Could that be due to conjugation with the ester group? For instance, the vinylic proton being adjacent to the ester oxygen, causing a downfield shift.

So, the structure would have a vinylic proton next to the ester O.

For example, O-CO-CH3 is the ester group, attached to a CH2, which is part of a double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because the oxygen can't have a double bond to the CH2 and a single bond to the ester.

Wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, so the R group is the propenyl or butenyl. So the R is attached to the oxygen, which is part of the ester.

So, for example, if R is CH2=CHCH2-, then the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this structure, the H on the CH (C2) would be next to the CH2 (C1) which is attached to the O. The H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0, so perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, but the H on C2 would be vinylic. So its chemical shift would be around 5-6 ppm. But in the data, it's at 7.0, which is higher. That suggests maybe another effect, like conjugation with the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the vinylic proton is adjacent to the ester group, causing a downfield shift. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that's not possible because the O would have a double bond to the CH2 and a single bond to the ester, which isn't feasible. So the structure must have the double bond in a position where the vinylic H is adjacent to the ester O.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-O-CO-CH3 connected to a double bond. But that would be O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3.

In this case, the H on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the CH2 (C1) and the CH2 (C3). So the H on C2 would couple with the two H's on C1, giving a triplet. But again, the data shows a doublet.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let's think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, the options are either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans.

Let me think about the number of vinylic protons in each case.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The vinylic protons are on the CH (C2), so one H. So in the NMR, only that H would appear as a vinylic peak.

But in the given data, there's a 7.0 ppm (1H) and a 5.5 ppm (1H). So perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons. But propenyl only has one.

Wait, that's a key point. Propenyl has only one vinylic proton, while butenyl would have two. So the presence of two vinylic protons in the NMR data suggests that the molecule is butenyl, not propenyl.

Because the data shows two vinylic protons (7.0 and 5.5), but wait, no. The data shows two separate peaks, but perhaps they're from the same double bond, each with one H.

Wait, but if it's propenyl, only one vinylic H. So the data showing two peaks would suggest butenyl.

But the data shows two separate H's: 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq). So if the structure is butenyl, which has two vinylic H's, each as a doublet, then perhaps the 7.0 is one and the 5.5 is the other.

But in the data, the 7.0 is a doublet with J=16. So that would match a trans coupling between two vinylic H's. The other would be at 5.5, which is a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, but in a trans configuration, both vinylic H's would be trans and thus each would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz. However, the data shows only one H at 7.0, so perhaps the other is at 5.5, but why the different coupling?

Alternatively, perhaps one vinylic H is coupled with another H, and the other vinylic H is coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C1 and C2. Then, the vinylic H on C1 (CH2) would have two H's, and the vinylic H on C2 (CH) would have one H. But that would give two different vinylic H's: one as a triplet (coupled to two H's on C1) and another as a doublet (coupled to two H's on C3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C2 and C3. Then, each end of the double bond has two H's. So the H's on C2 and C3 would each be coupled with each other, leading to doublets.

So in this case, the two vinylic H's would each be a doublet, and their chemical shifts would be around 5.5 and 5.8, perhaps. But in the data, one is at 7.0 and the other at 5.5.

Wait, but the 7.0 is significantly downfield. Maybe that's due to conjugation with the ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but with the double bond in a position that one of the vinylic H's is conjugated with the ester.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let's consider the integration and coupling again.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. So it's a vinylic H coupled with another H across the double bond (trans), giving J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm peak is 1H, dq. So that H is coupled with two different sets of H's, perhaps two different neighbors.

The 1.6 ppm peak is 3H, doublet, so it's a CH3 next to a CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). The vinylic H is at 7.0 (d, J=16), and the adjacent CH2's H's are at 5.5 (dq). But wait, the propenyl group only has one vinylic H. So in the structure, the H on the CH would be at 7.0, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's, which would be split by the CH H, giving a triplet. But the data shows a dq, so perhaps the CH2 is also coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. So, a branch at C2, making it isopropyl-like, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's an allyl ester, not propenyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the coupling constants.

In a trans double bond, the J between the two vinylic H's is around 16 Hz. So the 7.0 ppm H is coupled with another H across the double bond, giving a doublet with J=16.

The other vinylic H would be at another ppm, perhaps 5.5, but in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a doublet. So perhaps that suggests that the 5.5 H is coupled with more than one H.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 H is a CH that's next to a CH2 group (coupling with two H's) and also next to another CH group (coupling with one H), leading to a doublet of quadruplets. That could explain the dq.

So, for example, a structure like CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that's five carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). The vinylic H is at 7.0, and the adjacent CH2's H's are coupled with it, leading to a triplet. But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl). The vinylic H's are on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be a triplet due to coupling with the H on C2 (CH), and the H on C2 (CH) would be a doublet due to coupling with the H on C1 (CH2). But that doesn't match the data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl). So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H's on C2 and C3 are each two H's. Each would couple with the other, leading to a triplet for each. But the data shows different patterns.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the 5.5 peak is not a vinylic H but an allylic H. Allylic H's are adjacent to the double bond and can show coupling with the vinylic H's. So in that case, the 5.5 peak would be an allylic H, coupled with the vinylic H (J=6-8 Hz), and also coupled with adjacent H's, leading to a dq.

But the 7.0 peak would then be the vinylic H, coupled with the allylic H, giving a doublet.

So, for example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the vinylic H is on the CH, and the adjacent CH2 has two H's. The H's on the CH2 would be allylic and coupled with the vinylic H, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a dq at 5.5.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is more complex. Maybe the CH2 next to the double bond is also adjacent to another CH2, leading to more coupling.

Let me think about the options again. The options are either propenyl or butenyl, cis or trans.

If the structure is propenyl, then there's only one vinylic H. But the NMR shows two vinylic H's (7.0 and 5.5), which suggests it's butenyl.

So, focusing on the options A and D (butenyl), which are cis and trans.

In a trans double bond, the two vinylic H's are on opposite sides and would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In the data, the 7.0 is a doublet (J=16), and the 5.5 is a dq. So perhaps the 5.5 is a vinylic H coupled with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is an allylic H, not a vinylic one.

Wait, another approach: the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's split into two by one coupling and into four by another. So perhaps it's a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

Looking at the 1.6 ppm peak: 3H doublet. That suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group. So the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but that's a saturated structure. So perhaps it's CH3-CH2-CH=CH-OAc.

Wait, but that's a propenyl group? No, that's butenyl. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In that case, the vinylic H's would be on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be coupled with the H on C2 (CH), leading to a triplet. The H on C2 would be a doublet due to coupling with C1. But the data shows a doublet and a dq.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should make a table of each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis configuration, but for propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so cis would mean the substituents on each end are on the same side). But since propenyl has only one vinylic H, the NMR would show that H as a doublet if coupled with adjacent H's.

But in the data, there are two vinylic H's, which suggests butenyl.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, trans configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on each end are trans.

The vinylic H's would be on C1 and C2. The H on C1 (CH2) would be coupled with the H on C2 (CH), leading to a triplet for C1 and a doublet for C2. But in the data, 7.0 is a doublet, and 5.5 is a dq.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the trans configuration leads to the vinylic H's being on opposite sides. So each would be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But the data shows one at 7.0 and another at 5.5.

Alternatively, the 7.0 is one vinylic H, and the 5.5 is an allylic H, coupled with the vinylic H.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), and the 7.0 is the vinylic H, and the 5.5 is the adjacent CH2 H's, which are split into a dq due to coupling with the vinylic H and another group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is a methine (CH) group adjacent to a double bond and a CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. The CH2 at the end (C4) has a CH3 attached? No, because that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that's a branch, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's an allyl group, not propenyl.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a different approach. Let's look at the downfield shifts.

The 7.0 ppm is a vinylic H downfield, which suggests it's conjugated with something electronegative, like the ester group.

So, perhaps the vinylic H is adjacent to the ester oxygen, causing the downfield shift.

In that case, the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that's not possible because the O can't form a double bond to both the CH2 and the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-O-CO-CH3 connected to a CH=CH2 group. So, CH2-O-CO-CH3-CH=CH2. But that would be a longer chain, perhaps butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. In this case, the vinylic H on the CH is adjacent to the ester O, causing a downfield shift. So that H would be around 7.0 ppm, which matches the data.

Then, the adjacent CH2 would have two H's, which would be coupled with the vinylic H, giving a triplet. But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. The vinylic H (on CH) is at 7.0 (d, J=16), and the adjacent CH2's H's are at 5.5 (dq), perhaps coupled with another group.

Wait, but the CH2 would have two H's, so their signal would be a triplet due to coupling with the vinylic H. But the data shows a single H at 5.5 as a dq, which suggests it's a CH group, not a CH2.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, but that would mean the adjacent CH2 has two H's, which would be a triplet, not a dq.

Wait, another possibility: the 5.5 peak is a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. For example, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CO-CH3, but that's a branched structure, not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, and the 5.5 peak is the CH2 group next to the double bond. But the CH2 would have two H's, leading to a triplet.

I'm stuck again. Let me try to summarize what each option's NMR might look like.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Only one vinylic H (on CH), so NMR would show that as a doublet (coupled with adjacent CH2 H's), perhaps around 5.8 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be a triplet. But the data has a 7.0 ppm, which is higher, so maybe not.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, trans configuration. The vinylic H's would be on CH2 and CH. The CH2 H's would be a triplet, and the CH H would be a doublet. But the data has 7.0 and 5.5, which may not match.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, cis. The vinylic H's on CH2 and CH would be coupled, but their shifts might be around 5.5 and 5.8.

But the data shows 7.0 and 5.5, which is higher than typical.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. But I'm not sure how a propenyl can be trans. It would have the double bond between C1 and C2, but with substituents on the same side. But propenyl would have only one vinylic H, so the NMR would show that as a doublet, perhaps around 5.8.

But the data shows two vinylic H's, which suggests it's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have two vinylic H's as doublets. So the 7.0 would be one and the 5.5 would be the other.

But why is the 5.5 a dq?

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 is a CH group next to a CH2 and another group. For example, in the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, the H on C3 (CH2) would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 (double bond), leading to coupling with the vinylic H and also with the CH2 on C4, resulting in a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 is an allylic H, which is coupled with the vinylic H and another group, leading to the dq.

But I'm not entirely confident. Based on the data, the presence of a 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 suggests a trans configuration, and a butenyl group would have two vinylic H's, so options A and D are butenyl.

Between A (cis) and D (trans), which would have the vinylic H's at higher ppm?

In a trans configuration, the vinylic H's would be more deshielded due to the trans arrangement, leading to higher ppm shifts. So the 7.0 would be one trans vinylic H, and the other at around 5.5.

So, the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, option D.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Structure**:  
   The compound is an acetate ester, meaning it has the general structure **R-O-CO-CH3**, where **R** is either a propenyl or butenyl group. The options specify whether the double bond in the R group is cis or trans.

2. **NMR Data Interpretation**:  
   - The **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** peak indicates a vinylic proton coupled with another vinylic proton across a double bond. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) suggests a trans configuration.  
   - The **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** peak is a doublet of quadruplets, likely due to a proton coupled with two different sets of protons. This suggests an allylic or vinylic proton in a specific environment.  
   - The **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** peak corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group (**CH3** in **COCH3**).  
   - The **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** peak corresponds to a methyl group (**CH3**) attached to a CH2 group.

3. **Differentiating Propenyl and Butenyl**:  
   - A **propenyl group** (CH2=CHCH2-) has only one vinylic proton, which would appear as a doublet in the NMR. However, the data shows two distinct vinylic peaks (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a **butenyl group** (CH2=CHCH2CH2-), which has two vinylic protons.  
   - This eliminates options **B (Trans-propenyl acetate)** and **C (Cis-propenyl acetate)**.

4. **Cis vs. Trans Butenyl**:  
   - In a **cis-butenyl group**, the vinylic protons are on the same side of the double bond, leading to smaller coupling constants and chemical shifts closer to 5-6 ppm.  
   - In a **trans-butenyl group**, the vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, resulting in a larger coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and one of the peaks appearing at a higher chemical shift (7.0 ppm).  
   - The data matches the **trans-butenyl configuration**, with the 7.0 ppm peak corresponding to one vinylic proton and the 5.5 ppm peak corresponding to the other, which is coupled with additional protons (hence the dq).

### Conclusion:
The NMR data supports the structure of **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it accounts for the two vinylic protons, their coupling constants, and the observed splitting patterns.
