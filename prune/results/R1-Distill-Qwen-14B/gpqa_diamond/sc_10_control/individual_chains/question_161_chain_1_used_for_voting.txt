Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it again carefully.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

But even with that vacuum, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the compartment. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that's not the factor causing the change.

The question is about what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let's think about what the mean free path is. The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, the pressure is really low, so the mean free path is longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with.

The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. So λ is inversely proportional to pressure. But pressure is related to the number of particles.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure is already ultra-low. When the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas? Well, the electron beam has a high energy. Maybe it's causing some effects on the gas molecules.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is calculated in a static condition, but when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas is ionized. Because high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. If the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-section for scattering changes. 

Ionized gas (like ions) have a larger effective diameter than neutral atoms. Because ions have an electric charge, they might be more effective at scattering electrons. So the cross-section (d²) would be larger. Since λ is inversely proportional to d squared, if d increases, λ decreases.

So if the gas was neutral before and now becomes ionized, the mean free path λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Therefore, λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that's the conclusion.

Alternatively, could the electron beam cause heating? If the temperature increases, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So that's not a factor.

Another possibility is that the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment, thus reducing the pressure. But wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the existing pressure. If the pressure is lower, λ increases. But the question states that pressure is still the same as before, because the temperature hasn't changed. Or wait, maybe the beam doesn't change the pressure much; perhaps the main effect is the change in the effective cross-section.

So considering that, when the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path would decrease because the effective diameter is larger. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So the correct answer is C.

When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a mean free path of gas molecules determined to be λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1. The temperature remained constant, so it could not explain the change.

The mean free path (λ) is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(d\) is the effective diameter of the gas molecules, and \(P\) is pressure. Since the temperature and pressure are constant, the mean free path depends on the effective diameter \(d\).

When the electron beam is turned on, high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules have a larger effective diameter (\(d\)) due to their charged nature, which increases their cross-sectional area for scattering. As a result, the mean free path decreases because the gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other or with the electron beam.

Thus, λ2, the mean free path under the influence of the electron beam, is smaller than λ1, the mean free path in the neutral gas state. Therefore, the correct conclusion is:

**λ2 < λ1**
