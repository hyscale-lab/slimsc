Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, like the visible part. Oh right, and LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means that in each small region of the star's photosphere, the conditions are such that matter behaves as it would in a small container in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. So the atoms are excited according to the temperature of that region.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, 'excited' here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state, right? So the population of that energy level is higher in star_1 than star_2.

I think the key here is the Boltzmann distribution. The distribution of particles in different energy levels depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor gives the probability of a particle being in a particular energy state relative to the ground state. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Let me think. Oh wait, I remember that k (Boltzmann's constant) is about 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So that's interesting because the energy difference is equal to k times some temperature?

Wait, wait, let me check that. Wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So if the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE = k * T would mean T is 1 K. But that's probably not directly relevant here.

So, the ratio of the populations in the two energy levels is given. In star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited, so N1/N2 = 2. So for each star, the population ratio is based on their own temperatures.

So for star 1, N1 = (something) and for star 2, N2 = (something else). The ratio N1/N2 is 2.

Let me model this. For each star, the population ratio between the excited state and the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say the ground state is E1 and the excited state is E2. The ratio N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but wait I'm a bit confused about which way the ratio goes. Let me get this straight.

If E2 is higher than E1, then the ratio of N2 (higher energy) to N1 (lower) is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So for star 1, N2_star1 / N1_star1 = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly for star 2, N2_star2 / N1_star2 = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So maybe N2_star1 / N1_star1 is twice as big as N2_star2 / N1_star2. Or wait, perhaps the ratio is different. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms is twice as high in star_1's case.

Wait, but wait: if the energy levels are E1 (lower) and E2 (higher), then the population in E2 relative to E1 is N2/N1. So for star_1, N2_1 / N1_1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T1) ), and for star_2, N2_2 / N1_2 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is higher. So N2_1 is higher relative to N1_1 than N2_2 relative to N1_2. So (N2_1 / N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2). Is that correct? Wait, not exactly. Because if star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio, then that could be the case. Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the ratio N2/N1 in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, let me rephrase the problem. The excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level. So perhaps N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But wait, no, because the total number of atoms in each level (ground and excited) would depend on other factors too. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N2_1 / N1_1 is twice the ratio N2_2 / N1_2.

Wait, that's one way to interpret it. So, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is a function of their temperature. So star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, so the statement is: (N2_1 / N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2).

So let's write this as (N2_1/N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2).

But from Boltzmann distribution, (N2/N1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

So for star_1: (N2_1/N1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (N2_2/N1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So according to the problem, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the ratio:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, perhaps I should rearrange this equation to find a relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, let me write it as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes:

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k (1.38e-23 J/K), so ΔE = k. So substituting:

(k) / k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Simplify (k/k =1 ), so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, let me see which one matches this.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Which matches exactly what I have here. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the two energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to Boltzmann's constant \( k \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars, assuming LTE.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( N_2 \) and \( N_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through and simplifying:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the fact that \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation given in option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship.

The energy difference between the two energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to Boltzmann's constant \( k \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars, assuming LTE.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( N_2 \) and \( N_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

Using the fact that \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

This matches the equation given in option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship.
