Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm. Let me think about what I know.

The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that notation represents a two-component column vector. So the electron is in a spin state which can be written as a vector with components [3i, 4]^T. 

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector again. So ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ħ/2 ψ. Wait, because spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Right, because for spin-½ particles like electrons, the spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

So the Pauli Y matrix σ_y is given as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Right, and each spin component S_x, S_y, S_z is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† multiplied by σ_y, multiplied by ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4i ] since 3i's conjugate is -3, wait wait, no. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i, but when you take the transpose, it becomes the first element in the row vector. Wait, no, the conjugate transpose (dagger) of a column vector [a; b] is [a*, b*], as a row vector. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is just 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait wait, wait. 3i is the first component of ψ. So ψ is [3i; 4]. So ψ† would be [3i*, 4* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ]. Because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4.

So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, the operator σ_y is the 2x2 matrix as given. So let me write that again:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ, and then multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me compute σ_y multiplied by ψ first.

So σ_y * ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4; i*3i + 0*4] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute matrix multiplication.

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, ψ is a 2x1 column vector, so the product σ_y * ψ will be a 2x1 vector.

Compute each element:

First element (row 1, column 1 of σ_y times column 1 of ψ plus row 1, column 2 of σ_y times column 2 of ψ):

= (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second element (row 2, column 1 of σ_y times column 1 of ψ plus row 2, column 2 of σ_y times column 2 of ψ):

= (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So it's -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Now, multiply this by ψ†, which is [ -3i, 4 ]

So ψ† times (σ_y ψ) is the dot product of [ -3i, 4 ] with [ -4i, -3 ].

Which is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So now, the expectation value is (-24) multiplied by (ħ/2).

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24) * (ħ/2) = (-12 ħ).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have -12 ħ. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, wait, no. Because S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So the operator is (ħ/2)σ_y, so when we calculate ⟨S_y⟩, it's ψ† ( (ħ/2) σ_y ) ψ.

Which is (ħ/2) multiplied by ψ† σ_y ψ.

So in the calculation above, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So (ħ/2)*(-24) is (-12 ħ). But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. Hmm, but where is the 25 coming from?

Wait, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of ψ† σ_y ψ?

Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication steps.

Wait, first, σ_y times ψ: 

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

ψ = [3i; 4].

So the first element of σ_y ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i.

Second element is (i)(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, so ψ† = [3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So the product is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-12 ħ).

But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. Hmm, where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me recompute.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the order of multiplication. Oh wait, no: ψ† is a row vector, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, ψ is a column vector. So actually, the correct way is ψ† σ_y ψ. But ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, σ_y is 2x2, so when you multiply them, you get a 1x2 matrix, then multiply by ψ which is 2x1, giving a scalar.

Wait, perhaps I did the matrix multiplication correctly. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the components more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write ψ as a column vector and ψ† as a row vector, and compute each step.

Wait, let me think again. The state is ψ = [3i; 4].

So compute σ_y ψ:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i → -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² → 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, the inner product (dot product) of ψ† and σ_y ψ is:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² → 12 (-1) → -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) → -12.

Total sum is -12 -12 = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, none of the options have -12 ħ. The options have fractions with 25. Did I make a mistake in the normalization of the state vector?

Oh right! I forgot that the state vector must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector should have a norm of 1. So I need to normalize ψ first.

Wait, but the problem states that the state is (3i, 4). So perhaps it's already normalized, or perhaps it's not. Let me check.

The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is √25=5. So the state is not normalized. So I need to normalize it.

Ah! So the actual state vector is ψ / |ψ|, which is (1/5)[3i; 4].

So when we compute the expectation value, it would involve this normalized state.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. I didn't normalize the state. So I need to correct that.

So the correct ψ is (3i,4) divided by its norm, which is 5.

So ψ = (1/5) [3i; 4 ].

Therefore, ψ† would be (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized ψ.

Compute σ_y ψ: σ_y * (1/5) [3i;4] = (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† σ_y ψ is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

So that's (1/5)(1/5) [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i)= 12 i² = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Total sum inside is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (1/5)(1/5) = 1/25. So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-24) * (1/25) = -24/25.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Which matches option A: -12 ħ/25.

So the answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state vector**:  
   The norm of the state is given by \( |\psi|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \).  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator along the y-direction**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_y \psi = \psi^\dagger \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \right) \psi.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \sigma_y \), this becomes:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   Using \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).  
   The dot product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \) is:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Expanding this:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{25} \left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \right].
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   - \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),  
   - \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{25} (-12 - 12) = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final expectation value**:  
   Substituting into \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm. Let me think about what I know.

The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that notation represents a two-component column vector. So the electron is in a spin state which can be written as a vector with components [3i, 4]^T. 

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector again. So ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ħ/2 ψ. Wait, because spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Right, because for spin-½ particles like electrons, the spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

So the Pauli Y matrix σ_y is given as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Right, and each spin component S_x, S_y, S_z is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† multiplied by σ_y, multiplied by ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4i ] since 3i's conjugate is -3, wait wait, no. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i, but when you take the transpose, it becomes the first element in the row vector. Wait, no, the conjugate transpose (dagger) of a column vector [a; b] is [a*, b*], as a row vector. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is just 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait wait, wait. 3i is the first component of ψ. So ψ is [3i; 4]. So ψ† would be [3i*, 4* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ]. Because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4.

So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, the operator σ_y is the 2x2 matrix as given. So let me write that again:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ, and then multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me compute σ_y multiplied by ψ first.

So σ_y * ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4; i*3i + 0*4] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute matrix multiplication.

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, ψ is a 2x1 column vector, so the product σ_y * ψ will be a 2x1 vector.

Compute each element:

First element (row 1, column 1 of σ_y times column 1 of ψ plus row 1, column 2 of σ_y times column 2 of ψ):

= (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second element (row 2, column 1 of σ_y times column 1 of ψ plus row 2, column 2 of σ_y times column 2 of ψ):

= (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So it's -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Now, multiply this by ψ†, which is [ -3i, 4 ]

So ψ† times (σ_y ψ) is the dot product of [ -3i, 4 ] with [ -4i, -3 ].

Which is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So now, the expectation value is (-24) multiplied by (ħ/2).

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24) * (ħ/2) = (-12 ħ).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have -12 ħ. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, wait, no. Because S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So the operator is (ħ/2)σ_y, so when we calculate ⟨S_y⟩, it's ψ† ( (ħ/2) σ_y ) ψ.

Which is (ħ/2) multiplied by ψ† σ_y ψ.

So in the calculation above, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So (ħ/2)*(-24) is (-12 ħ). But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. Hmm, but where is the 25 coming from?

Wait, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of ψ† σ_y ψ?

Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication steps.

Wait, first, σ_y times ψ: 

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

ψ = [3i; 4].

So the first element of σ_y ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i.

Second element is (i)(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, so ψ† = [3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So the product is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-12 ħ).

But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. Hmm, where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me recompute.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the order of multiplication. Oh wait, no: ψ† is a row vector, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, ψ is a column vector. So actually, the correct way is ψ† σ_y ψ. But ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, σ_y is 2x2, so when you multiply them, you get a 1x2 matrix, then multiply by ψ which is 2x1, giving a scalar.

Wait, perhaps I did the matrix multiplication correctly. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the components more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write ψ as a column vector and ψ† as a row vector, and compute each step.

Wait, let me think again. The state is ψ = [3i; 4].

So compute σ_y ψ:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i → -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² → 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, the inner product (dot product) of ψ† and σ_y ψ is:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² → 12 (-1) → -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) → -12.

Total sum is -12 -12 = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, none of the options have -12 ħ. The options have fractions with 25. Did I make a mistake in the normalization of the state vector?

Oh right! I forgot that the state vector must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector should have a norm of 1. So I need to normalize ψ first.

Wait, but the problem states that the state is (3i, 4). So perhaps it's already normalized, or perhaps it's not. Let me check.

The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is √25=5. So the state is not normalized. So I need to normalize it.

Ah! So the actual state vector is ψ / |ψ|, which is (1/5)[3i; 4].

So when we compute the expectation value, it would involve this normalized state.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. I didn't normalize the state. So I need to correct that.

So the correct ψ is (3i,4) divided by its norm, which is 5.

So ψ = (1/5) [3i; 4 ].

Therefore, ψ† would be (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized ψ.

Compute σ_y ψ: σ_y * (1/5) [3i;4] = (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† σ_y ψ is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

So that's (1/5)(1/5) [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i)= 12 i² = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Total sum inside is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (1/5)(1/5) = 1/25. So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-24) * (1/25) = -24/25.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Which matches option A: -12 ħ/25.

So the answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state vector**:  
   The norm of the state is given by \( |\psi|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \).  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator along the y-direction**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_y \psi = \psi^\dagger \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \right) \psi.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \sigma_y \), this becomes:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   Using \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).  
   The dot product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \) is:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Expanding this:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{25} \left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \right].
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   - \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),  
   - \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \frac{1}{25} (-12 - 12) = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final expectation value**:  
   Substituting into \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
