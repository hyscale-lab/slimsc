Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that the rotation-vibration model is used to describe the energy levels of a diatomic molecule, considering both rotational and vibrational motions. But wait, the question is specifically about the fundamental state and the photon momentum needed for the next state.

Alright, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that's the ground state. The question is asking what photon momentum is required for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, the next state—so the first excited state.

Wait, but what's the structure of the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model? I remember that the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational (J) and vibrational (n) quantum numbers. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The vibrational part is quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational part is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, but maybe that's complicating things. Wait, the problem says "non-rigid rotor model," but for the purpose of this question, perhaps I can treat it as a rigid rotor because the bond length is given. Or maybe that's not relevant here.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. That usually refers to n=0 and J=0. So the ground state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule, moving it to the next possible state. But which state is the "next" state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, so the next state would be the one with the lowest energy higher than the current state. So the current state is the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next higher energy state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (n=0, J=1). Which of these two has lower energy?

To determine that, I need to calculate the energy of both possibilities and see which is lower. Because if the rotational state's energy is lower than the vibrational state's, then the photon would cause a transition to J=1, n=0. Otherwise, if the vibrational transition requires less energy, the photon would cause a transition to n=1, J=0.

So let me figure out the energies involved.

First, the vibrational energy when n=1: E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

What about the rotational energy when J=1: E_rot = B * J (J+1) = B * 2. And B is the rotational constant, which is ħ/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but I need to compute B. I is the moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY). 

Given mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that to kg because SI units are needed for calculations.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B is ħ/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.05457e-34 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.363e11 rad^-1.

Wait, no: because B has units of energy? Wait, no, B is in units of cm^-1 or something? Wait, no, B is in terms of energy when multiplied by J(J+1). Wait, no, B has units of energy per angular momentum, so when multiplied by J(J+1), it gives energy. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). So B is ħ²/(2I), which would be in units of energy.

Wait, yes, because I is in kg m², so ħ²/(2I) is (J s)^2/(kg m²) → (kg^2 m^4 /s²) / kg m²) → kg m² / s² → which is energy (joules). So B is in joules.

Wait, let me compute B correctly.

I = μ r² = (20/11 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2. Wait, converting to kg:

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. Similarly, mY is 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

Wait, wait no: wait, mX is 20 amu, which is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. mY is 2 amu= 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 kg). Wait, let me compute that.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.02 * 1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.102e-52) / (3.652e-26) ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Hmm, that aligns with my earlier calculation.

I = μ r². r is 2e-10 m: r² is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then B = (ħ²) / (2I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that seems low. Because 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.6e-23 J is about 2.87e-4 eV. That's about 0.287 meV. Hmm, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but the vibrational energy. The given angular frequency is w=4e14 rad/s. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħw.

For n=0, E_vib_ground = (0 + 1/2) ħw = 0.5 * ħ *4e14.

Let me compute this: ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. So 0.5 *1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 *4.218e-20 = 2.109e-20 J.

So for the vibrational first excited state (n=1), E_vib is (1.5) * 2.109e-20 J → 3.1635e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, E_vib for n=1 is 3/2 times the ground state. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * J (J+1) = B * 2. B is 4.607e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.607e-23 = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, now comparing E_vib for n=1 (3.16e-20 J) versus E_rot for J=1 (9.21e-23 J). Clearly, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the molecule would preferentially transition to the next rotational state if that's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the original state is n=0, J=0. The next possible states are either n=1, J=0 (vibrational) or n=0, J=1 (rotational). So we need to compare these two.

So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is ΔE_vib = E(1,0) - E(0,0) = (3/2 - 1/2) ħw = ħw.

Which is ħ * 4e14 rad/s.

So 1.05457e-34 J s *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

And the rotational transition's energy difference is ΔE_rot = E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B * 2 - 0 = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

So 9.214e-23 J is much less than 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon would cause the molecule to transition to the next rotational state, J=1, rather than the vibrational state.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy above the current state. So between the two options, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = hf = pc, where f is frequency and c is speed of light. So p = E/c.

So E_photon = 9.214e-23 J → p_photon = 9.214e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the diatomic molecule's transition is not only rotational but also includes the vibrational change. Because in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both changes. Oh wait, no, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), and the photon is absorbed to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a vibrational state with n=1 and J=0. Because in some cases, the vibrational transitions might be lower in energy than the rotational transitions. Wait, no, earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me go through that again.

I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass. mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = (40/22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2I).

So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Then B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.208e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So B is about 4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 * B = 9.21e-23 J.

E_vib for n=1 is 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

Calculating photon's momentum: p = E/c.

E = 9.21e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. Wait, wait a second—N·s is kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum (since p = mv). So Ns is kg·m/s. So the options are in kg·m/s.

Wait, my calculation gave 3.07e-31 kg m/s. None of the options match that. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong energy difference. Maybe the molecule is in the vibrational ground state but a higher rotational state. But in the fundamental state, J=0 and n=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state isn't just a rotational or vibrational transition, but a combination. But that's more complex and perhaps beyond this problem.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state as the first state higher than the ground state, which could be the first vibrational state regardless of rotational state. But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the transition where both n and J increase. But that would require even more energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. The total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. The ground state is n=0, J=0.

The next state would be where the total energy is the next higher level. So the possible next states are (n=1, J=0), (n=0, J=1), (n=1, J=1), etc. We need the state with the lowest energy higher than the ground state.

So we need to find which of these possible states has the smallest ΔE.

Compute E for each possible next state:

E(1,0): E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħw = 3/2 ħw = 3/2 * ħ *4e14 ≈ 3/2 *4.218e-20 J ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot(1,0) = E(1,0) = 6.327e-20 J.

E(0,1): E_rot = B * 2 = 9.214e-23 J.

Which is much lower than E(1,0). So E(0,1) is lower than E(1,0).

What about E(1,1)? That would be E_vib(1) + E_rot(2) = 6.327e-20 + (4 * B) = 6.327e-20 + 4 *4.607e-23 = 6.327e-20 + 1.843e-22 = approximately 6.345e-20 J.

Which is higher than E(0,1). So the lowest next state is (0,1) with E=9.214e-23 J.

Thus, the energy of the photon must be equal to this ΔE, so E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, but that gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in this approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is considering the molecule transitioning from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. But what's the next state? Let's think about the ordering of energy levels.

For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are closely spaced when B is small, and vibrational levels are spaced by much higher energies. So the rotational transitions (changing J) are lower in energy than vibrational transitions (changing n).

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are such that for each vibrational level, there are a series of rotational levels. So the ordering of energy levels would be:

n=0, J=0 → lowest energy.

Next would be n=0, J=1.

Then perhaps n=0, J=2, and so on.

Then comes n=1, J=0, then n=1, J=1, etc.

So the order of states in increasing energy is: (0,0) < (0,1) < (0,2) < ... < (1,0) < (1,1) < (1,2) < etc.

Wait, that depends on the relative magnitudes of B and the spacing between vibrational levels. If B is small compared to the vibrational energy spacing, then the rotational levels within a vibrational manifold would be lower in energy than moving to the next vibrational level.

So, since the energy E(1,0) is much higher than E(0,1), and E(0,2) is higher than E(0,1), etc., the first excited state would be (0,1), and the photon energy needed is the rotational transition.

So, the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

But the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let's compute the photon's momentum again.

E = pc → p = E/c.

E = 9.214e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.214e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns (since Ns is kg m/s). But none of the options are this small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps B is in cm^-1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe another approach is to compute the rotational constant B in terms of w. Another formula comes to mind: B = (ħ²)/(2I), and I = μ r².

Alternatively, I can compute B in terms of the given data.

Wait, let me consider the moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) ) = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = ?

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, but 4.6e-23 J is 4.6e-23 / (1.6e-19) eV ≈ 2.875e-4 eV, which is about 0.2875 meV. That seems very small, but perhaps correct.

So, the photon's energy is 2 * B = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy would be E_photon = h f = p c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using E_photon = pc.

p = E_photon / c.

So 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options given are this small. The smallest option is D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = 2B.

Yes.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both J increases and n increases, but that would require more energy. But that's not the case for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the energy difference between the vibrational first excited state and the ground state, not considering the rotational state. But that would have a much higher energy, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first state where both J and n change in a way that the total energy is minimized. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the first excited state for rotation. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, and the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħ w.

In the ground state, n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0.

So the energy difference is ΔE = E_rot(1,0) - E_rot(0,0) = B * 2.

So the photon's energy must be 2B, and thus the momentum p = E_photon / c = (2B) / c.

Given B = ħ²/(2I) → So 2B = 2 * (ħ^2)/(2I) ) = ħ² / I.

So 2B = ħ²/(I) = (ħ / sqrt(I)) )^2.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 2B again.

Wait, B = (ħ²) / (2I) → 2B = ħ² / I.

So 2B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Same as before.

So p_photon = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (J=0, n=0) to the state (n=0, J=1) but multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, that's the same as what I did before.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the energy difference between the first excited rotational state (J=1) and the ground state, but the photon's energy is the rotational energy, which is 2B. But perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum.

Wait, I think I messed up the order of options. Let me double-check the options.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, my computed p_photon is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s. That's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I have a miscalculation in the value of B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

mY is 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, why is that? Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = 11.0224e-53 = 1.10224e-52.

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26.

So μ = 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) → numerator is 1.112e-68, denominator 2.414e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.212e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different model, such as the rigid rotor, but with the same approach. Maybe I should compute the energy using the vibrational part.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is not just the rotational transition but a combination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's energy as the vibrational energy. Let's see.

E_photon_vib = ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon_vib = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Ah! Now, looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the photon energy be the vibrational energy? Because in the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state, and perhaps the next state refers to the first vibrational state, not considering rotation.

But earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition?

Unless the molecule is in a state where rotation is already at maximum for some reason, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering just the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation, as a simplification.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), so both effects are considered. Therefore, the correct energy difference is the rotational one, but that leads to a momentum not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be based on the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Wait, looking back, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be J=1, n=0, but perhaps the problem assumes that this transition is not allowed, and the next possible transition is n=1, J=0.

But why would that be the case? Usually, rotational transitions are dipole allowed, as long as the angular momentum selection rule ΔJ = ±1 is satisfied. For diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are allowed when ΔJ=±1, and vibrational transitions are allowed when Δn=±1.

So in the case of the molecule in (n=0,J=0), the allowed transitions are to (n=0, J=1) for rotation, or (n=1, J=0) for vibration, or (n=1, J=1), etc.

But which requires less energy? The rotational transition, as we saw.

But the options don't have the p for that. So perhaps the problem is asking about the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational transitions are not possible for some reason, or that the problem expects only the vibrational part to be considered.

But the question states that it's using the rotation-vibration model, so it should consider both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the first overtone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy. Let me see.

E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħw.

E_rot = B J (J+1).

We can compute B in terms of w.

But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the next state is (n=0, J=1) and (n=1, J=0), and the photon's energy is the sum of both. But that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the combined energy of both transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to provide the energy for both a rotational and a vibrational transition, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg. Let me recheck.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mX = 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27) kg.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = approx 1.103e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.653e-26 = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m → r squared is 4e-20 m².

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 → 4.606e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended approach is to compute the photon's momentum as the vibrational transition, leading to option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So even though the rotational transition requires less energy, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational transition. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state regardless of rotation, assuming that the rotational state is negligible. But that's not correct based on the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition and see if it matches any option.

E_photon_vib = ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns, which is approximately option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to move the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the rotation-vibration model. The molecule's energy levels are given by:

\[
E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
\]

where \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega\) and \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J(J+1)\), with \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\) being the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated as:

\[
I = \mu r^2
\]

where \(\mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}\) is the reduced mass, and \(r\) is the bond length. Using the given data:

- \(m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\), and \(r = 2 \, \text{angstroms}\),
- \(\mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}\),
- Converting \(\mu\) to kg: \(1.818 \, \text{amu} \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/amu} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\),
- \(r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\),
- \(I = \mu r^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2\),
- \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

The energy difference for the rotational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\)) from \(J=0\) to \(J=1\) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.606 \times 10^{-23} = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}}\)) from \(n=0\) to \(n=1\) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E_{\text{vib}}(n=1) - E_{\text{vib}}(n=0) = \hbar\omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

Comparing the two, the rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\(9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) than the vibrational transition (\(4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)). However, the photon's momentum is calculated using \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).

For the vibrational transition:

\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

This matches option D (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)). While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem may assume the photon causes a vibrational transition, leading to this answer.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that the rotation-vibration model is used to describe the energy levels of a diatomic molecule, considering both rotational and vibrational motions. But wait, the question is specifically about the fundamental state and the photon momentum needed for the next state.

Alright, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that's the ground state. The question is asking what photon momentum is required for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, the next state—so the first excited state.

Wait, but what's the structure of the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model? I remember that the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational (J) and vibrational (n) quantum numbers. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The vibrational part is quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational part is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, but maybe that's complicating things. Wait, the problem says "non-rigid rotor model," but for the purpose of this question, perhaps I can treat it as a rigid rotor because the bond length is given. Or maybe that's not relevant here.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. That usually refers to n=0 and J=0. So the ground state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule, moving it to the next possible state. But which state is the "next" state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, so the next state would be the one with the lowest energy higher than the current state. So the current state is the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next higher energy state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (n=0, J=1). Which of these two has lower energy?

To determine that, I need to calculate the energy of both possibilities and see which is lower. Because if the rotational state's energy is lower than the vibrational state's, then the photon would cause a transition to J=1, n=0. Otherwise, if the vibrational transition requires less energy, the photon would cause a transition to n=1, J=0.

So let me figure out the energies involved.

First, the vibrational energy when n=1: E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

What about the rotational energy when J=1: E_rot = B * J (J+1) = B * 2. And B is the rotational constant, which is ħ/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but I need to compute B. I is the moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY). 

Given mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that to kg because SI units are needed for calculations.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B is ħ/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.05457e-34 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.363e11 rad^-1.

Wait, no: because B has units of energy? Wait, no, B is in units of cm^-1 or something? Wait, no, B is in terms of energy when multiplied by J(J+1). Wait, no, B has units of energy per angular momentum, so when multiplied by J(J+1), it gives energy. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). So B is ħ²/(2I), which would be in units of energy.

Wait, yes, because I is in kg m², so ħ²/(2I) is (J s)^2/(kg m²) → (kg^2 m^4 /s²) / kg m²) → kg m² / s² → which is energy (joules). So B is in joules.

Wait, let me compute B correctly.

I = μ r² = (20/11 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2. Wait, converting to kg:

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. Similarly, mY is 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

Wait, wait no: wait, mX is 20 amu, which is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. mY is 2 amu= 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 kg). Wait, let me compute that.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.02 * 1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.102e-52) / (3.652e-26) ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Hmm, that aligns with my earlier calculation.

I = μ r². r is 2e-10 m: r² is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then B = (ħ²) / (2I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that seems low. Because 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.6e-23 J is about 2.87e-4 eV. That's about 0.287 meV. Hmm, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but the vibrational energy. The given angular frequency is w=4e14 rad/s. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħw.

For n=0, E_vib_ground = (0 + 1/2) ħw = 0.5 * ħ *4e14.

Let me compute this: ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. So 0.5 *1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 *4.218e-20 = 2.109e-20 J.

So for the vibrational first excited state (n=1), E_vib is (1.5) * 2.109e-20 J → 3.1635e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, E_vib for n=1 is 3/2 times the ground state. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * J (J+1) = B * 2. B is 4.607e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.607e-23 = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, now comparing E_vib for n=1 (3.16e-20 J) versus E_rot for J=1 (9.21e-23 J). Clearly, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the molecule would preferentially transition to the next rotational state if that's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the original state is n=0, J=0. The next possible states are either n=1, J=0 (vibrational) or n=0, J=1 (rotational). So we need to compare these two.

So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is ΔE_vib = E(1,0) - E(0,0) = (3/2 - 1/2) ħw = ħw.

Which is ħ * 4e14 rad/s.

So 1.05457e-34 J s *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

And the rotational transition's energy difference is ΔE_rot = E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B * 2 - 0 = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

So 9.214e-23 J is much less than 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon would cause the molecule to transition to the next rotational state, J=1, rather than the vibrational state.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy above the current state. So between the two options, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = hf = pc, where f is frequency and c is speed of light. So p = E/c.

So E_photon = 9.214e-23 J → p_photon = 9.214e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the diatomic molecule's transition is not only rotational but also includes the vibrational change. Because in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both changes. Oh wait, no, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), and the photon is absorbed to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a vibrational state with n=1 and J=0. Because in some cases, the vibrational transitions might be lower in energy than the rotational transitions. Wait, no, earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me go through that again.

I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass. mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = (40/22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2I).

So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Then B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.208e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So B is about 4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 * B = 9.21e-23 J.

E_vib for n=1 is 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

Calculating photon's momentum: p = E/c.

E = 9.21e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. Wait, wait a second—N·s is kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum (since p = mv). So Ns is kg·m/s. So the options are in kg·m/s.

Wait, my calculation gave 3.07e-31 kg m/s. None of the options match that. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong energy difference. Maybe the molecule is in the vibrational ground state but a higher rotational state. But in the fundamental state, J=0 and n=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state isn't just a rotational or vibrational transition, but a combination. But that's more complex and perhaps beyond this problem.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state as the first state higher than the ground state, which could be the first vibrational state regardless of rotational state. But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the transition where both n and J increase. But that would require even more energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. The total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. The ground state is n=0, J=0.

The next state would be where the total energy is the next higher level. So the possible next states are (n=1, J=0), (n=0, J=1), (n=1, J=1), etc. We need the state with the lowest energy higher than the ground state.

So we need to find which of these possible states has the smallest ΔE.

Compute E for each possible next state:

E(1,0): E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħw = 3/2 ħw = 3/2 * ħ *4e14 ≈ 3/2 *4.218e-20 J ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot(1,0) = E(1,0) = 6.327e-20 J.

E(0,1): E_rot = B * 2 = 9.214e-23 J.

Which is much lower than E(1,0). So E(0,1) is lower than E(1,0).

What about E(1,1)? That would be E_vib(1) + E_rot(2) = 6.327e-20 + (4 * B) = 6.327e-20 + 4 *4.607e-23 = 6.327e-20 + 1.843e-22 = approximately 6.345e-20 J.

Which is higher than E(0,1). So the lowest next state is (0,1) with E=9.214e-23 J.

Thus, the energy of the photon must be equal to this ΔE, so E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, but that gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in this approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is considering the molecule transitioning from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. But what's the next state? Let's think about the ordering of energy levels.

For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are closely spaced when B is small, and vibrational levels are spaced by much higher energies. So the rotational transitions (changing J) are lower in energy than vibrational transitions (changing n).

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are such that for each vibrational level, there are a series of rotational levels. So the ordering of energy levels would be:

n=0, J=0 → lowest energy.

Next would be n=0, J=1.

Then perhaps n=0, J=2, and so on.

Then comes n=1, J=0, then n=1, J=1, etc.

So the order of states in increasing energy is: (0,0) < (0,1) < (0,2) < ... < (1,0) < (1,1) < (1,2) < etc.

Wait, that depends on the relative magnitudes of B and the spacing between vibrational levels. If B is small compared to the vibrational energy spacing, then the rotational levels within a vibrational manifold would be lower in energy than moving to the next vibrational level.

So, since the energy E(1,0) is much higher than E(0,1), and E(0,2) is higher than E(0,1), etc., the first excited state would be (0,1), and the photon energy needed is the rotational transition.

So, the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

But the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let's compute the photon's momentum again.

E = pc → p = E/c.

E = 9.214e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.214e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns (since Ns is kg m/s). But none of the options are this small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps B is in cm^-1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe another approach is to compute the rotational constant B in terms of w. Another formula comes to mind: B = (ħ²)/(2I), and I = μ r².

Alternatively, I can compute B in terms of the given data.

Wait, let me consider the moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) ) = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = ?

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, but 4.6e-23 J is 4.6e-23 / (1.6e-19) eV ≈ 2.875e-4 eV, which is about 0.2875 meV. That seems very small, but perhaps correct.

So, the photon's energy is 2 * B = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy would be E_photon = h f = p c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using E_photon = pc.

p = E_photon / c.

So 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options given are this small. The smallest option is D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = 2B.

Yes.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both J increases and n increases, but that would require more energy. But that's not the case for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the energy difference between the vibrational first excited state and the ground state, not considering the rotational state. But that would have a much higher energy, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first state where both J and n change in a way that the total energy is minimized. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the first excited state for rotation. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, and the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħ w.

In the ground state, n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0.

So the energy difference is ΔE = E_rot(1,0) - E_rot(0,0) = B * 2.

So the photon's energy must be 2B, and thus the momentum p = E_photon / c = (2B) / c.

Given B = ħ²/(2I) → So 2B = 2 * (ħ^2)/(2I) ) = ħ² / I.

So 2B = ħ²/(I) = (ħ / sqrt(I)) )^2.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 2B again.

Wait, B = (ħ²) / (2I) → 2B = ħ² / I.

So 2B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Same as before.

So p_photon = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (J=0, n=0) to the state (n=0, J=1) but multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, that's the same as what I did before.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the energy difference between the first excited rotational state (J=1) and the ground state, but the photon's energy is the rotational energy, which is 2B. But perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum.

Wait, I think I messed up the order of options. Let me double-check the options.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, my computed p_photon is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s. That's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I have a miscalculation in the value of B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

mY is 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, why is that? Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = 11.0224e-53 = 1.10224e-52.

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26.

So μ = 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) → numerator is 1.112e-68, denominator 2.414e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.212e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different model, such as the rigid rotor, but with the same approach. Maybe I should compute the energy using the vibrational part.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is not just the rotational transition but a combination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's energy as the vibrational energy. Let's see.

E_photon_vib = ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon_vib = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Ah! Now, looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the photon energy be the vibrational energy? Because in the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state, and perhaps the next state refers to the first vibrational state, not considering rotation.

But earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition?

Unless the molecule is in a state where rotation is already at maximum for some reason, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering just the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation, as a simplification.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), so both effects are considered. Therefore, the correct energy difference is the rotational one, but that leads to a momentum not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be based on the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Wait, looking back, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be J=1, n=0, but perhaps the problem assumes that this transition is not allowed, and the next possible transition is n=1, J=0.

But why would that be the case? Usually, rotational transitions are dipole allowed, as long as the angular momentum selection rule ΔJ = ±1 is satisfied. For diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are allowed when ΔJ=±1, and vibrational transitions are allowed when Δn=±1.

So in the case of the molecule in (n=0,J=0), the allowed transitions are to (n=0, J=1) for rotation, or (n=1, J=0) for vibration, or (n=1, J=1), etc.

But which requires less energy? The rotational transition, as we saw.

But the options don't have the p for that. So perhaps the problem is asking about the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational transitions are not possible for some reason, or that the problem expects only the vibrational part to be considered.

But the question states that it's using the rotation-vibration model, so it should consider both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the first overtone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy. Let me see.

E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħw.

E_rot = B J (J+1).

We can compute B in terms of w.

But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the next state is (n=0, J=1) and (n=1, J=0), and the photon's energy is the sum of both. But that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the combined energy of both transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to provide the energy for both a rotational and a vibrational transition, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg. Let me recheck.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mX = 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27) kg.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = approx 1.103e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.653e-26 = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m → r squared is 4e-20 m².

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 → 4.606e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended approach is to compute the photon's momentum as the vibrational transition, leading to option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So even though the rotational transition requires less energy, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational transition. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state regardless of rotation, assuming that the rotational state is negligible. But that's not correct based on the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition and see if it matches any option.

E_photon_vib = ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns, which is approximately option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to move the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the rotation-vibration model. The molecule's energy levels are given by:

\[
E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
\]

where \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega\) and \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J(J+1)\), with \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\) being the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated as:

\[
I = \mu r^2
\]

where \(\mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}\) is the reduced mass, and \(r\) is the bond length. Using the given data:

- \(m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\), and \(r = 2 \, \text{angstroms}\),
- \(\mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}\),
- Converting \(\mu\) to kg: \(1.818 \, \text{amu} \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/amu} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\),
- \(r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\),
- \(I = \mu r^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2\),
- \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

The energy difference for the rotational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\)) from \(J=0\) to \(J=1\) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.606 \times 10^{-23} = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}}\)) from \(n=0\) to \(n=1\) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E_{\text{vib}}(n=1) - E_{\text{vib}}(n=0) = \hbar\omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

Comparing the two, the rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\(9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) than the vibrational transition (\(4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)). However, the photon's momentum is calculated using \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).

For the vibrational transition:

\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

This matches option D (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)). While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem may assume the photon causes a vibrational transition, leading to this answer.
