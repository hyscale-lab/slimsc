Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a quasar's observations and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the quasar's flux drops significantly below 790 nm. Wait, isn't that related to the Lyman-alpha forest or some kind of absorption? Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but if the quasar's light is being observed in the near-infrared, that might be because of redshift. Like, the light is being stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

So, the peak is at 790 nm. If it's a specific emission line, let's think about what wavelength that corresponds to. Wait, I remember the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. So maybe this line is redshifted to 790 nm.

So let's calculate the redshift, z. The formula is observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). So 790 = 121.6*(1+z). Let me do that math. 790 /121.6 is approximately 6.498. So 1+z =6.498, so z is about 5.498. So the redshift is roughly 5.5.

Wait, but wait, could it be another line? The Lyman break is around 91 nm, but that's about the ionization limit. If the observed peak is in the near-infrared, perhaps around 790 nm, which is longer than optical, so yeah, that's consistent with a high redshift object. So I think the redshift z is about 5.5.

Now, the next part is about the comoving distance. The question gives the Hubble constant, H0=70 km/s/Mpc. And the parameters: matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total=1).

I need to find the comoving distance at a=1 (since the scale factor a=1 is now, so it's the present time). Wait, wait, no, wait. The comoving distance is the distance at the scale factor a. Oh wait, the question says "comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from Earth." Wait, a=1 is our current time? So the quasar is at a=1? That doesn't make sense. Because a=1 is now, and quasars are high-redshift objects. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpret the question. Maybe the scale factor they're referring to is the quasar's emission time, but I'm getting confused. Let me read again.

The question states: "the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth." Wait, no, in cosmology, the comoving distance is the distance a galaxy or object is away, considering the expansion of the universe. At a=1, that's the present time, so the comoving distance would be the same as the distance now. But quasars are at high redshifts, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the scale factor when the light was emitted, which would be a lower a than 1. Hmm, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the comoving distance when the quasar's light was emitted, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the comoving distance is a way to express distance that remains constant over time (in an expanding universe). So the comoving distance for a=1 would be the current distance, which would be higher for a high-redshift object.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the proper distance now, which would be the comoving distance multiplied by a, but a is 1 now. So it's just the comoving distance as of now.

Wait, but the options are in Gpc. Let's think about how to calculate the comoving distance for a given redshift. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{3w}), but wait, dark energy equation of state is usually w=-1, so (1+z)^{3w} = (1+z)^{-3}, but some models have different w, but the question gives w= -1, so E(z)=sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3} + Omega_k*(1+z)^2)} but since the universe is flat, Omega_k=0, so E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}).

Wait, but for high redshifts (z>1), the matter density term dominates. Since z is about 5.5, which is quite high. So E(z) would be approximately sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3) = sqrt(0.3 * 274.625) = sqrt(82.3875) ≈ 9.07. So 1/E(z) is about 0.11.

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to use an approximation for the comoving distance for high redshifts. Alternatively, I can look up the standard formula or use a calculator.

Alternatively, I think for high redshifts (z>>1), the universe's expansion history can be approximated, but perhaps the best way is to think in terms of the lookback time and then find the comoving distance based on that.

Alternatively, I might remember that at high redshifts, the comoving distance is approximately proportional to c times the lookback time divided by H0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use an online calculator or a table for comoving distances. But since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the integral.

The comoving distance D_C is given by (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z').

So, the integral is from 0 to z=5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7(1+z')^{-3})} dz'.

Hmm, that integral is tricky. Let me make a substitution. Let me define x = 1+z', so when z'=0, x=1, and when z'=5.5, x=6.5.

So the integral becomes ∫(x=1 to 6.5) dx/(x * sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7 x^{-3})) ) * [since dz' = dx, because z'=x-1, so dz'=dx]

Simplify the denominator inside sqrt:

0.3 x^3 + 0.7 x^{-3} = [0.3 x^6 + 0.7]/x^3

So sqrt becomes sqrt( [0.3 x^6 + 0.7] ) / x^{3/2}.

So putting it all together, the integrand becomes x^{3/2} / sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) ) * (1/x) dx = [x^{1/2}]/sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) dx.

Wait, that's still complicated. Let me factor out x^6 inside the sqrt:

sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) = x^3 sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6} )

So the integrand becomes x^{1/2} / [x^3 sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6}) ) ] dx.

Simplify numerator and denominator: x^{1/2} / x^3 = x^{-5/2}.

So the integrand is x^{-5/2} / sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6} ) dx.

Hmm, not much better. Alternatively, perhaps for x=6.5, which is about 6, x^{-6} is small (1/(6^6) ~ 1/46656 ~ 2e-5). So 0.7 x^{-6} is negligible compared to 0.3. So approximating sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6}) ~ sqrt(0.3) = sqrt(3/10) ≈ 0.5477.

So the integrand becomes x^{-5/2} / 0.5477 dx.

So the integral from x=1 to x=6.5 is approximately ∫ x^{-5/2} dx / 0.5477.

The integral of x^{-5/2} dx is [x^{-3/2}/( -3/2 ) ] + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 6.5:

( (6.5)^{-3/2} - (1)^{-3/2} ) / ( -3/2 )

Which is ( (1/(6.5^{1.5}) ) - 1 ) / (-1.5 )

So 6.5^1.5 = sqrt(6.5^3) = sqrt(274.625) ≈ 16.568.

So 1/16.568 ≈ 0.0604.

So (0.0604 - 1) = -0.9396.

Divide by -1.5: (-0.9396)/(-1.5) = 0.6264.

So the integral is 0.6264 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.144.

So the comoving distance D_C is (c / H0) * 1.144.

Wait, but let's compute c in km/s. c ≈ 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5/70) Mpc = (approx 4285.714) Mpc.

So 4285.714 Mpc × 1.144 ≈ 4285.714 * 1.144 ≈ Let's compute that.

4285.714 * 1 = 4285.714.

4285.714 * 0.144 ≈ 4285.714 * 0.1 is 428.57, 0.04 is 171.43, 0.004 is 17.14. So total is 428.57 +171.43=600, and 600 +17.14=617.14.

So total is approx 4285.714 + 617.14 ≈ 4902.85 Mpc.

Convert to Gpc: 4902.85 Mpc = 4.90285 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, I made an approximation that 0.7 x^{-6} is negligible at x=6.5. Let's see: 0.7 x^{-6} for x=6.5 is 0.7/(6.5^6). 6.5^2=42.25, 6.5^3=274.625, 6.5^6=(6.5^3)^2= (274.625)^2 ≈ 75436. So 0.7 /75436 ≈ ~9.27e-6. So sqrt(0.3 + 9.27e-6) ≈ sqrt(0.3) = 0.5477. So my approximation is acceptable.

But wait, what about when x is not so large, like x=2 or 3? Then 0.7 x^{-6} could be significant. So perhaps my approximation overestimates the integral because for lower x, the dark energy term is more important. Hmm, but at high z, the matter dominates, so maybe the approximation is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is to consider that for z>1, the integral can be approximated as (2/(3*H0)) * (c) * (1 + z)^{-3/2}.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for comoving distance for a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy. There's no simple formula, but perhaps an approximate one can be used.

Alternatively, I might remember that the comoving distance for z=5 is approximately 2.6 Gpc (using H0=70), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, the integral I did was approx 1.144, but that's the value of the integral. Then D_C is (c / H0) * 1.144.

c is 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c / H0 is (3e5)/70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is ~4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 1.144: 4.2857 *1.144 ≈ 4.914 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 4.9 Gpc. But wait, the answer options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, that's lower than the options. So perhaps my approximation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the dark energy term isn't negligible. Let me try a better approximation.

Alternatively, if I don't neglect the dark energy term, I can't make that substitution, but it's complicated. Perhaps I can look for a better approximation or use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the proper way is to use the age of the universe at high z.

Wait, another approach: The comoving distance can be estimated as the integral from 0 to z of c/H(a) da, where a=1/(1+z). Wait, let me rephrase.

Wait, the scale factor a is 1/(1+z), so a=1/(1+5.5)=1/6.5≈0.1538.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that approach. Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator or a standard table.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think about the age of the universe at high redshift. The age at z=5.5 can be calculated, and then multiply by the Hubble parameter at that time to get the comoving distance.

Wait, the age of the universe is given by the integral from 0 to z of 1/(H0 E(z')) dz' / (1+z').

Wait, no, the age is the integral from 0 to z of 1/(a H) da, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the age of the universe at redshift z is t(z) = 1/(H0) ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / [E(z') (1+z')].

Then the comoving distance is D_C = c * t(z) * (1 + z).

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the comoving distance is D_C = ∫(from 0 to z) c/(H0 E(z')) dz'.

Which is the same as (c/H0) ∫ dz'/(E(z')).

So perhaps I should calculate this integral more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation for E(z) when z is large.

At high z, matter dominates, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3) ) = sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2) ) )

So the integral becomes 1/sqrt(0.3) ∫(0 to 5.5) (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

Let me make a substitution u=1+z', so du=dz'

Integral becomes ∫(u=1 to u=6.5) u^{-3/2} du.

Which is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 6.5.

So that's (-2/(√6.5) ) + 2/(√1) )

√6.5 is approx 2.55, so 2/2.55≈0.7843.

So the integral is ( 2 - 2 * 0.7843 ) = 2(1 - 0.7843) ) = 2 (0.2157) ) = 0.4314.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1/0.5477 ≈ 1.826.

So the integral is 0.4314 * 1.826 ≈ 0.789.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 0.789.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0=70.

3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 0.789: 4.2857 * 0.789 ≈ 3.37 Gpc.

Hmm, but that's even lower than before. But this approach assumes that dark energy is negligible, which isn't the case. Because E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}) ), so for z=5.5, 0.3*(1+z)^3 is about 0.3*(6.5)^3 =0.3*274.625=82.3875, and 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}=0.7/(274.625)≈0.00255. So E(z)=sqrt(82.3875 +0.00255)≈9.078. So using E(z)=9.078, which is higher than the matter-only case, which would have E(z)=sqrt(82.3875)=9.077. So the impact is minimal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a better approximation formula for the comoving distance in the Lambda-CDM model.

I recall that for a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated by different expressions depending on whether matter or dark energy dominates. For high redshifts, matter dominates, but at some point dark energy starts to contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion or another approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for an approximate value.

Wait, another approach: use the lookback time and then calculate the comoving distance.

Lookback time t_LB is given by (1/c) ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / [ (1+z') H0 E(z') ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using an online cosmology calculator would help, but since I can't do that, I have to proceed.

Alternatively, I can remember that for the standard cosmology (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 1.8 billion parsecs or 1.8 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right because quasars at z=5 are much further away.

Wait, perhaps I've confused proper distance with comoving distance. Let me think: The comoving distance for z=5 is about 2.0 Gpc. Hmm, but the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the redshift calculation. Let me double-check.

The observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So the factor is 790/121.6 ≈ 6.498. So 1+z=6.498, z=5.498. Correct.

Wait, so if z=5.5, and if the comoving distance is about 5 Gpc, but the options are around 6-9 Gpc, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral more precisely. Let me try to compute it numerically.

So the integral is ∫(0 to 5.5) dz'/(sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7*(1+z')^{-3}) )

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate the integral by breaking it into intervals. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution to make it easier.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation formula from a cosmology textbook or notes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2/(3 H0)) * (1/(1+z))^{3/2} ) ]^{-1}.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / E(z')] dz'

And in a matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1), E(z) = (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral would be ∫ dz' (1+z')^{-3/2} = 2 (1 + z)^{-1/2}.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 2 (1 + z)^{-1/2}.

But in our case, Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, so the expansion is different. But perhaps for an order of magnitude estimate, I can use this.

So with z=5.5, 1+z=6.5, (1+z)^{-1/2}=1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.396.

So D_C ≈ (3e5 /70 ) * 2 * 0.396.

3e5/70 is approximately 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 2: 8.571 Gpc.

Multiply by 0.396: 8.571 * 0.396 ≈ 3.39 Gpc.

Hmm, but again, that's lower than the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the presence of dark energy, the expansion is accelerating, which makes the universe younger and the comoving distance larger than in a matter-only universe. Wait, no, in the presence of dark energy, the expansion accelerates, which would cause the universe to expand more, leading to larger comoving distances?

Wait, dark energy causes the expansion to accelerate, so for a given redshift, the comoving distance might be larger than in a matter-only universe because the expansion is faster at later times, so the light has more time to travel.

Wait, but for high z, the matter term dominates, so the dark energy effect is less. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation for E(z). Let me compute E(z) at some points and do a rough integration.

Let's compute E(z) at several z values between 0 and 5.5, and then perform a trapezoidal integration.

Let's choose steps of 0.5 in z.

But wait, z starts at 0 and goes up to 5.5.

Compute E(z) at z=0, 0.5,1,1.5,...,5.5.

But this is time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

At z=0: E= sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 +0.7*(1)^{-3})= sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1.

z=0.5: (1+z) =1.5.

0.3*(1.5)^3=0.3*(3.375)=1.0125.

0.7*(1.5)^{-3}=0.7/(3.375)≈0.2078.

Sum=1.0125+0.2078=1.2203. sqrt(1.2203)=1.1047.

z=1: (1+z)=2.

0.3*(8)=2.4.

0.7/(8)=0.0875.

Sum=2.4+0.0875=2.4875. sqrt≈1.577.

z=1.5: 1+z=2.5.

0.3*(2.5)^3=0.3*15.625=4.6875.

0.7/(2.5)^3=0.7/(15.625)=0.0448.

Sum=4.6875+0.0448=4.7323. sqrt≈2.175.

z=2: (1+z)=3.

0.3*27=8.1.

0.7/(27)=0.0259.

Sum=8.1259. sqrt≈2.85.

z=2.5: (3.5)^3=42.875. 0.3*42.875=12.8625.

0.7/(42.875)=0.01633.

Sum=12.8788. sqrt≈3.589.

z=3: (4)^3=64. 0.3*64=19.2.

0.7/(64)=0.0109375.

Sum=19.2109. sqrt≈4.383.

z=3.5: (4.5)^3=91.125. 0.3*91.125=27.3375.

0.7/(91.125)=0.00768.

Sum=27.345. sqrt≈5.23.

z=4: (5)^3=125. 0.3*125=37.5.

0.7/(125)=0.0056.

Sum=37.5056. sqrt≈6.12.

z=4.5: (5.5)^3=166.375. 0.3*166.375=49.9125.

0.7/(166.375)=0.004208.

Sum=49.9167. sqrt≈7.065.

z=5: (6)^3=216. 0.3*216=64.8.

0.7/(216)=0.00324.

Sum=64.80324. sqrt≈8.05.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875.

0.7/(274.625)=0.00255.

Sum=82.3875+0.00255=82.39005. sqrt≈9.077.

So now, I have E(z) at various z points. Now, the integrand is 1/E(z). So I can compute 1/E(z) for each z and then perform a trapezoidal integration.

Compute 1/E(z) for each z:

z=0: 1/E=1/1=1.

z=0.5: 1/1.1047≈0.905.

z=1:1/1.577≈0.634.

z=1.5:1/2.175≈0.459.

z=2:1/2.85≈0.3508.

z=2.5:1/3.589≈0.2786.

z=3:1/4.383≈0.2282.

z=3.5:1/5.23≈0.1912.

z=4:1/6.12≈0.1634.

z=4.5:1/7.065≈0.1416.

z=5:1/8.05≈0.1242.

z=5.5:1/9.077≈0.11.

Now, to perform the trapezoidal integration from z=0 to z=5.5 in steps of 0.5.

The formula for the trapezoidal rule is:

Integral ≈ (Δz/2) * [f(z0) + 2f(z1) + 2f(z2) + ... + 2f(z_{n-1}) ) + f(z_n) ]

So for each interval between z_i and z_{i+1}, we compute (z_{i+1}-z_i)/2 * [f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1}) ].

But since the step is 0.5, Δz=0.5 for each step.

Let me break it down:

Number of steps: 12 points (z=0 to 5.5 in 0.5 increments, so 12 points including z=0 and z=5.5).

But wait, from z=0 to z=5.5, with step 0.5, that's 11 steps (5.5 /0.5 =11 steps).

Wait, let me list the z and 1/E(z):

z: 0 → 0.5 →1 →1.5 →2 →2.5 →3 →3.5 →4 →4.5 →5 →5.5.

So 11 intervals between 12 points.

Using the trapezoidal rule for each interval:

Interval 0-0.5: (0.5/2) [1 + 0.905] = 0.25*(1.905)=0.47625.

0.5-1: 0.25*(0.905 +0.634)= 0.25*(1.539)=0.38475.

1-1.5: 0.25*(0.634 +0.459)=0.25*(1.093)=0.27325.

1.5-2: 0.25*(0.459 +0.3508)=0.25*(0.8098)=0.20245.

2-2.5: 0.25*(0.3508 +0.2786)=0.25*(0.6294)=0.15735.

2.5-3: 0.25*(0.2786 +0.2282)=0.25*(0.5068)=0.1267.

3-3.5:0.25*(0.2282 +0.1912)=0.25*(0.4194)=0.10485.

3.5-4:0.25*(0.1912 +0.1634)=0.25*(0.3546)=0.08865.

4-4.5:0.25*(0.1634 +0.1416)=0.25*(0.305)=0.07625.

4.5-5:0.25*(0.1416 +0.1242)=0.25*(0.2658)=0.06645.

5-5.5:0.25*(0.1242 +0.11)=0.25*(0.2342)=0.05855.

Now sum all these up:

0.47625
+0.38475 = 0.861
+0.27325 = 1.13425
+0.20245 =1.3367
+0.15735=1.49405
+0.1267=1.62075
+0.10485=1.7256
+0.08865=1.81425
+0.07625=1.8905
+0.06645=1.95695
+0.05855=2.0155.

So the approximate integral is 2.0155.

Now, D_C = (c/H0) * integral.

c=3e5 km/s.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0=3e5/70 ≈ 4285.714 Mpc.

So D_C=4285.714 Mpc * 2.0155 ≈ Let's compute that.

4285.714 * 2 = 8571.428 Mpc.

4285.714 * 0.0155≈4285.714 *0.01=42.857, 0.005=21.42857, 0.0005=2.14287. So 42.857+21.42857=64.28557 +2.14287≈66.428 Mpc.

So total is 8571.428 +66.428≈8637.856 Mpc.

Convert to Gpc: 8637.856 /1000 ≈8.637856 Gpc.

So approximately 8.6 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, and option C is 9. So 8.6 is closer to 9, but perhaps I made some approximations. Alternatively, the exact calculation might give around 8.5 or 8.6, which would round to 9. But the options don't have 8.5. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc.

Wait, but my approximation using the trapezoidal rule may not be accurate enough. Let's think: the integral from 0 to 5.5 of 1/E(z) dz is approximately 2.0155. But perhaps the actual integral is a bit higher, leading to a comoving distance of around 8.6 Gpc. So the closest option would be 8 Gpc (option B) or 9 Gpc (option C). Alternatively, if the exact calculation is around 8.6, perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

But wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, 8.6 is close to 9, but given that the approximation with the trapezoidal rule using only 11 intervals may have underestimated, perhaps the true value is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)7 Gpc. Hmm, but 8.6 isn't near 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me re-check the trapezoidal sum.

Wait, adding up the intervals again:

First interval (0-0.5): 0.47625.

Next (0.5-1): 0.38475 → sum 0.861.

Then (1-1.5): 0.27325 → sum 1.13425.

Then (1.5-2):0.20245 → sum 1.3367.

Then (2-2.5):0.15735 → sum 1.49405.

Then (2.5-3):0.1267 → sum 1.62075.

Then (3-3.5):0.10485 → sum 1.7256.

Then (3.5-4):0.08865 → sum 1.81425.

Then (4-4.5):0.07625 → sum 1.8905.

Then (4.5-5):0.06645 → sum 1.95695.

Then (5-5.5):0.05855 → sum 2.0155.

So the integral is 2.0155.

Multiply by (3e5/70) Mpc → 4285.714 * 2.0155 ≈8637.85 Mpc → 8.6378 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 8.6 Gpc, which would be closer to option C)9 Gpc. But the options don't have 8.5, so perhaps the intended answer is B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I have an error in the way I calculated E(z). Let me double-check E(z) at some points.

Wait, at z=0, E=1. Correct.

z=0.5: (1+0.5)=1.5.

0.3*(1.5)^3=0.3*(3.375)=1.0125.

0.7*(1.5)^{-3}=0.7/(3.375)=0.2077. Sum=1.0125+0.2077=1.2202. sqrt(1.2202)=1.1047. Correct.

z=1: (2)^3=8. 0.3*8=2.4. 0.7/8=0.0875. Sum=2.4875. sqrt=1.577. Correct.

z=2: (3)^3=27. 0.3*27=8.1. 0.7/(27)=0.0259. Sum=8.1259. sqrt=2.85. Correct.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875. 0.7/(274.625)=0.00255. Sum=82.39005. sqrt≈9.077. Correct.

So the E(z) values are correct.

So the integration seems correct, leading to about 8.6 Gpc. So the closest option is B)8 Gpc or C)9 Gpc. But the question's options don't have 8.5, so perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the emission line is incorrect. If the peak is at 790 nm and it's not the Lyman-alpha line, but perhaps another line. For example, if it's the Balmer series, but in that case, the rest wavelength would be longer. Let me think: the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm (rest frame). If observed at 790 nm, then (1+z)=790/656≈1.204. So z=0.204. That would be nearby, but the comoving distance would be much less than the options given. So that's unlikely.

Another possibility: the peak is not an emission line but something else, but the question says it's an emission line, I think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observed peak is due to the Lyman break. The Lyman break occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts absorbs the UV light, making the spectrum drop below a certain wavelength. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is redshifted from 91 nm, then (1+z)=790/91≈8.68. So z≈7.68. That's a higher redshift, which would mean a larger comoving distance.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if the peak is at 790 nm and it's the Lyman limit, then z=7.68, which is higher than before.

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me recalculate for z=7.68.

So for z=7.68, let's compute the comoving distance.

Again, the integral is ∫(0 to 7.68) dz'/E(z').

E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7*(1+z')^{-3} )

Again, perform a trapezoidal integration, but this time up to z=7.68. Let's choose step sizes of 1.0.

Compute E(z) at z=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.68.

But that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for high z, where E(z)≈sqrt(0.3*(z')^3) = sqrt(0.3) z'^(3/2).

So the integral becomes ∫(0 to z) dz'/(sqrt(0.3) z'^(3/2) ) ) = (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ z'^{-3/2} dz' from 0 to z.

The integral of z'^{-3/2} is [ z'^{-1/2} / (-1/2) ] = -2 z'^{-1/2}.

So the integral from 0 to z is [ -2 z'^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z → 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(z) ).

But wait, that's assuming E(z) = sqrt(0.3) z'^{3/2}, which is true for z >>1.

So for z=7.68, the integral is 2 * (1 - 1/sqrt(7.68)) ) ≈ 2*(1 - 0.369) )= 2*0.631=1.262.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1.826, gives 1.262 *1.826≈2.305.

So D_C= (3e5/70) *2.305 ≈4285.7 *2.305≈9862 Mpc →9.86 Gpc.

So if the peak is the Lyman limit, then the comoving distance is about 9.86 Gpc, which would correspond to option C)9 Gpc.

But earlier, when assuming the peak was Lyman-alpha, the distance was about 8.6 Gpc. So if the peak is Lyman-alpha, then the distance is ~8.6 Gpc. If it's the Lyman limit, then ~9.86 Gpc.

But the problem states that the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. That's more consistent with the Lyman break, as the IGM would absorb wavelengths below the Lyman limit. So the peak is at the Lyman break, which would correspond to longer comoving distance.

So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. The peak is at the Lyman break, not the Lyman-alpha line.

In that case, the redshift z is approximately (790 nm /91 nm ) -1 ≈8.68-1=7.68.

So let's recompute the comoving distance for z=7.68.

But to be precise, I'll have to compute the integral more accurately.

Alternatively, what if the peak is the Lyman limit, so z=7.68. Then, using the same approach as before, perhaps the comoving distance is about 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are up to 9 Gpc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 9 Gpc.

But let me recap: if the observed peak is at 790 nm and it's the Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength 121.6 nm), then z=5.5 and D_C≈8.6 Gpc. If it's the Lyman break (rest 91 nm), then z≈7.68 and D_C≈9.86 Gpc, which would round to 10, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. The question says that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. So the drop occurs below 790 nm, suggesting that the emission is at 790 nm, which would be the Lyman-alpha line, as the Lyman break would cause a sharp drop below a certain wavelength, and the peak would be just above that. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that would be just above the Lyman-break wavelength, which would be at 790*(1+z)=91 nm. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The Lyman-break occurs at (1+z) * 91 nm = observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The Lyman limit is at 91 nm. So any photon with wavelength below that is absorbed. So if the quasar emits light at 91 nm, but the universe's expansion redshifts it to 790 nm, then that would mean (1+z)=790/91≈8.68. So z≈7.68.

So in this case, the peak isn't an emission line but the break in the spectrum due to the IGM absorption. So the redshift would be higher, and the comoving distance would be larger.

So for z=7.68, let's compute the comoving distance.

Again, using the trapezoidal method, but this time up to z=7.68, which would be tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for high z.

At high z, E(z)=sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 )=sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integral ∫(0 to z) dz'/(sqrt(0.3)(1+z')^{3/2}) ) ) = (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'.

Let u=1+z', du=dz', integral becomes ∫ u^{-3/2} du from u=1 to u=1+z.

Which is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 1+z.

So integral is 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ) / sqrt(0.3).

Wait, wait, no. Let me recompute.

Integral of u^{-3/2} du is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ].

So from u=1 to u=1+z:

2 (1/sqrt(1) - 1/sqrt(1+z)) ) = 2(1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)).

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3):

Integral = 2(1 -1/sqrt(1+z)) / sqrt(0.3).

So for z=7.68, 1+z=8.68.

sqrt(8.68)=2.946.

So 1/sqrt(8.68)=0.3395.

So 1 -0.3395=0.6605.

So integral= 2 *0.6605 / sqrt(0.3) ≈1.321 /0.5477≈2.411.

Multiply by c/H0: 4285.7 Mpc *2.411≈ 4285.7 *2.411.

Let's compute 4285.7 *2=8571.4.

4285.7 *0.4=1714.28.

4285.7 *0.011≈47.14.

Total≈8571.4+1714.28=10285.68 +47.14=10332.82 Mpc →10.3328 Gpc.

But this is with the assumption that dark energy is negligible. But for z=7.68, which is high, matter dominates, so the approximation holds. So comoving distance is about 10.3 Gpc.

But the options only go up to 9 Gpc, which suggests that perhaps the initial assumption of the Lyman-alpha line is correct, giving a distance of 8.6 Gpc, which is option B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, leading to z=5.5.

But the options don't have 8.6. So perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc, option B.

Wait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

So the correct option would be B)8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar located at a high redshift, based on observations of its spectrum. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Identifying the Redshift**:  
   The observed peak in the spectrum is at a wavelength of 790 nm. Assuming this corresponds to the Lyman-alpha emission line (rest wavelength = 121.6 nm), the redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{790}{121.6} \approx 6.498 \implies z \approx 5.498
   \]  

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz'
   \]  
   where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda (1+z)^{-3}} \), and the cosmological parameters are \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), and the universe is flat.

3. **Integral Approximation**:  
   For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the matter density term dominates \( E(z) \), so \( E(z) \approx \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3} \). The integral simplifies to:  
   \[
   \int_0^z \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz' \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Omega_m}} \int_0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} \, dz'
   \]  
   This evaluates to:  
   \[
   \int_0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} \, dz' = 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right]
   \]  
   Substituting \( z = 5.5 \):  
   \[
   \int_0^{5.5} \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz' \approx 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{6.5}} \right] \approx 1.144
   \]  

4. **Calculating \( D_C \)**:  
   Using \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \):  
   \[
   \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc}
   \]  
   Multiplying by the integral result:  
   \[
   D_C = 4285.7 \times 1.144 \approx 4902 \, \text{Mpc} \approx 4.9 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]  

5. **Revisiting the Assumption**:  
   If the observed peak at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman-break (rest wavelength = 91 nm), the redshift would be higher:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{790}{91} \approx 8.68 \implies z \approx 7.68
   \]  
   For \( z \approx 7.68 \), the comoving distance increases due to the higher redshift. Using similar approximations, \( D_C \approx 9.86 \, \text{Gpc} \).

6. **Final Consideration**:  
   The problem states that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm, which is consistent with the Lyman-break feature. Thus, the higher redshift \( z \approx 7.68 \) and corresponding \( D_C \approx 9.86 \, \text{Gpc} \) is more appropriate. However, the closest option provided is **9 Gpc**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a quasar's observations and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the quasar's flux drops significantly below 790 nm. Wait, isn't that related to the Lyman-alpha forest or some kind of absorption? Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but if the quasar's light is being observed in the near-infrared, that might be because of redshift. Like, the light is being stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

So, the peak is at 790 nm. If it's a specific emission line, let's think about what wavelength that corresponds to. Wait, I remember the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. So maybe this line is redshifted to 790 nm.

So let's calculate the redshift, z. The formula is observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). So 790 = 121.6*(1+z). Let me do that math. 790 /121.6 is approximately 6.498. So 1+z =6.498, so z is about 5.498. So the redshift is roughly 5.5.

Wait, but wait, could it be another line? The Lyman break is around 91 nm, but that's about the ionization limit. If the observed peak is in the near-infrared, perhaps around 790 nm, which is longer than optical, so yeah, that's consistent with a high redshift object. So I think the redshift z is about 5.5.

Now, the next part is about the comoving distance. The question gives the Hubble constant, H0=70 km/s/Mpc. And the parameters: matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total=1).

I need to find the comoving distance at a=1 (since the scale factor a=1 is now, so it's the present time). Wait, wait, no, wait. The comoving distance is the distance at the scale factor a. Oh wait, the question says "comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from Earth." Wait, a=1 is our current time? So the quasar is at a=1? That doesn't make sense. Because a=1 is now, and quasars are high-redshift objects. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpret the question. Maybe the scale factor they're referring to is the quasar's emission time, but I'm getting confused. Let me read again.

The question states: "the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth." Wait, no, in cosmology, the comoving distance is the distance a galaxy or object is away, considering the expansion of the universe. At a=1, that's the present time, so the comoving distance would be the same as the distance now. But quasars are at high redshifts, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the scale factor when the light was emitted, which would be a lower a than 1. Hmm, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the comoving distance when the quasar's light was emitted, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the comoving distance is a way to express distance that remains constant over time (in an expanding universe). So the comoving distance for a=1 would be the current distance, which would be higher for a high-redshift object.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the proper distance now, which would be the comoving distance multiplied by a, but a is 1 now. So it's just the comoving distance as of now.

Wait, but the options are in Gpc. Let's think about how to calculate the comoving distance for a given redshift. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{3w}), but wait, dark energy equation of state is usually w=-1, so (1+z)^{3w} = (1+z)^{-3}, but some models have different w, but the question gives w= -1, so E(z)=sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3} + Omega_k*(1+z)^2)} but since the universe is flat, Omega_k=0, so E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}).

Wait, but for high redshifts (z>1), the matter density term dominates. Since z is about 5.5, which is quite high. So E(z) would be approximately sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3) = sqrt(0.3 * 274.625) = sqrt(82.3875) ≈ 9.07. So 1/E(z) is about 0.11.

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to use an approximation for the comoving distance for high redshifts. Alternatively, I can look up the standard formula or use a calculator.

Alternatively, I think for high redshifts (z>>1), the universe's expansion history can be approximated, but perhaps the best way is to think in terms of the lookback time and then find the comoving distance based on that.

Alternatively, I might remember that at high redshifts, the comoving distance is approximately proportional to c times the lookback time divided by H0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use an online calculator or a table for comoving distances. But since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the integral.

The comoving distance D_C is given by (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z').

So, the integral is from 0 to z=5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7(1+z')^{-3})} dz'.

Hmm, that integral is tricky. Let me make a substitution. Let me define x = 1+z', so when z'=0, x=1, and when z'=5.5, x=6.5.

So the integral becomes ∫(x=1 to 6.5) dx/(x * sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7 x^{-3})) ) * [since dz' = dx, because z'=x-1, so dz'=dx]

Simplify the denominator inside sqrt:

0.3 x^3 + 0.7 x^{-3} = [0.3 x^6 + 0.7]/x^3

So sqrt becomes sqrt( [0.3 x^6 + 0.7] ) / x^{3/2}.

So putting it all together, the integrand becomes x^{3/2} / sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) ) * (1/x) dx = [x^{1/2}]/sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) dx.

Wait, that's still complicated. Let me factor out x^6 inside the sqrt:

sqrt(0.3 x^6 + 0.7) = x^3 sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6} )

So the integrand becomes x^{1/2} / [x^3 sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6}) ) ] dx.

Simplify numerator and denominator: x^{1/2} / x^3 = x^{-5/2}.

So the integrand is x^{-5/2} / sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6} ) dx.

Hmm, not much better. Alternatively, perhaps for x=6.5, which is about 6, x^{-6} is small (1/(6^6) ~ 1/46656 ~ 2e-5). So 0.7 x^{-6} is negligible compared to 0.3. So approximating sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 x^{-6}) ~ sqrt(0.3) = sqrt(3/10) ≈ 0.5477.

So the integrand becomes x^{-5/2} / 0.5477 dx.

So the integral from x=1 to x=6.5 is approximately ∫ x^{-5/2} dx / 0.5477.

The integral of x^{-5/2} dx is [x^{-3/2}/( -3/2 ) ] + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 6.5:

( (6.5)^{-3/2} - (1)^{-3/2} ) / ( -3/2 )

Which is ( (1/(6.5^{1.5}) ) - 1 ) / (-1.5 )

So 6.5^1.5 = sqrt(6.5^3) = sqrt(274.625) ≈ 16.568.

So 1/16.568 ≈ 0.0604.

So (0.0604 - 1) = -0.9396.

Divide by -1.5: (-0.9396)/(-1.5) = 0.6264.

So the integral is 0.6264 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.144.

So the comoving distance D_C is (c / H0) * 1.144.

Wait, but let's compute c in km/s. c ≈ 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5/70) Mpc = (approx 4285.714) Mpc.

So 4285.714 Mpc × 1.144 ≈ 4285.714 * 1.144 ≈ Let's compute that.

4285.714 * 1 = 4285.714.

4285.714 * 0.144 ≈ 4285.714 * 0.1 is 428.57, 0.04 is 171.43, 0.004 is 17.14. So total is 428.57 +171.43=600, and 600 +17.14=617.14.

So total is approx 4285.714 + 617.14 ≈ 4902.85 Mpc.

Convert to Gpc: 4902.85 Mpc = 4.90285 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, I made an approximation that 0.7 x^{-6} is negligible at x=6.5. Let's see: 0.7 x^{-6} for x=6.5 is 0.7/(6.5^6). 6.5^2=42.25, 6.5^3=274.625, 6.5^6=(6.5^3)^2= (274.625)^2 ≈ 75436. So 0.7 /75436 ≈ ~9.27e-6. So sqrt(0.3 + 9.27e-6) ≈ sqrt(0.3) = 0.5477. So my approximation is acceptable.

But wait, what about when x is not so large, like x=2 or 3? Then 0.7 x^{-6} could be significant. So perhaps my approximation overestimates the integral because for lower x, the dark energy term is more important. Hmm, but at high z, the matter dominates, so maybe the approximation is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is to consider that for z>1, the integral can be approximated as (2/(3*H0)) * (c) * (1 + z)^{-3/2}.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for comoving distance for a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy. There's no simple formula, but perhaps an approximate one can be used.

Alternatively, I might remember that the comoving distance for z=5 is approximately 2.6 Gpc (using H0=70), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, the integral I did was approx 1.144, but that's the value of the integral. Then D_C is (c / H0) * 1.144.

c is 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c / H0 is (3e5)/70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is ~4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 1.144: 4.2857 *1.144 ≈ 4.914 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 4.9 Gpc. But wait, the answer options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, that's lower than the options. So perhaps my approximation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the dark energy term isn't negligible. Let me try a better approximation.

Alternatively, if I don't neglect the dark energy term, I can't make that substitution, but it's complicated. Perhaps I can look for a better approximation or use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the proper way is to use the age of the universe at high z.

Wait, another approach: The comoving distance can be estimated as the integral from 0 to z of c/H(a) da, where a=1/(1+z). Wait, let me rephrase.

Wait, the scale factor a is 1/(1+z), so a=1/(1+5.5)=1/6.5≈0.1538.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that approach. Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator or a standard table.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think about the age of the universe at high redshift. The age at z=5.5 can be calculated, and then multiply by the Hubble parameter at that time to get the comoving distance.

Wait, the age of the universe is given by the integral from 0 to z of 1/(H0 E(z')) dz' / (1+z').

Wait, no, the age is the integral from 0 to z of 1/(a H) da, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the age of the universe at redshift z is t(z) = 1/(H0) ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / [E(z') (1+z')].

Then the comoving distance is D_C = c * t(z) * (1 + z).

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the comoving distance is D_C = ∫(from 0 to z) c/(H0 E(z')) dz'.

Which is the same as (c/H0) ∫ dz'/(E(z')).

So perhaps I should calculate this integral more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation for E(z) when z is large.

At high z, matter dominates, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3) ) = sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2) ) )

So the integral becomes 1/sqrt(0.3) ∫(0 to 5.5) (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

Let me make a substitution u=1+z', so du=dz'

Integral becomes ∫(u=1 to u=6.5) u^{-3/2} du.

Which is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 6.5.

So that's (-2/(√6.5) ) + 2/(√1) )

√6.5 is approx 2.55, so 2/2.55≈0.7843.

So the integral is ( 2 - 2 * 0.7843 ) = 2(1 - 0.7843) ) = 2 (0.2157) ) = 0.4314.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1/0.5477 ≈ 1.826.

So the integral is 0.4314 * 1.826 ≈ 0.789.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 0.789.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0=70.

3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 0.789: 4.2857 * 0.789 ≈ 3.37 Gpc.

Hmm, but that's even lower than before. But this approach assumes that dark energy is negligible, which isn't the case. Because E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}) ), so for z=5.5, 0.3*(1+z)^3 is about 0.3*(6.5)^3 =0.3*274.625=82.3875, and 0.7*(1+z)^{-3}=0.7/(274.625)≈0.00255. So E(z)=sqrt(82.3875 +0.00255)≈9.078. So using E(z)=9.078, which is higher than the matter-only case, which would have E(z)=sqrt(82.3875)=9.077. So the impact is minimal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a better approximation formula for the comoving distance in the Lambda-CDM model.

I recall that for a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated by different expressions depending on whether matter or dark energy dominates. For high redshifts, matter dominates, but at some point dark energy starts to contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion or another approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for an approximate value.

Wait, another approach: use the lookback time and then calculate the comoving distance.

Lookback time t_LB is given by (1/c) ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / [ (1+z') H0 E(z') ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using an online cosmology calculator would help, but since I can't do that, I have to proceed.

Alternatively, I can remember that for the standard cosmology (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 1.8 billion parsecs or 1.8 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right because quasars at z=5 are much further away.

Wait, perhaps I've confused proper distance with comoving distance. Let me think: The comoving distance for z=5 is about 2.0 Gpc. Hmm, but the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the redshift calculation. Let me double-check.

The observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So the factor is 790/121.6 ≈ 6.498. So 1+z=6.498, z=5.498. Correct.

Wait, so if z=5.5, and if the comoving distance is about 5 Gpc, but the options are around 6-9 Gpc, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral more precisely. Let me try to compute it numerically.

So the integral is ∫(0 to 5.5) dz'/(sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7*(1+z')^{-3}) )

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate the integral by breaking it into intervals. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution to make it easier.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation formula from a cosmology textbook or notes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2/(3 H0)) * (1/(1+z))^{3/2} ) ]^{-1}.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) [1 / E(z')] dz'

And in a matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1), E(z) = (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral would be ∫ dz' (1+z')^{-3/2} = 2 (1 + z)^{-1/2}.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 2 (1 + z)^{-1/2}.

But in our case, Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, so the expansion is different. But perhaps for an order of magnitude estimate, I can use this.

So with z=5.5, 1+z=6.5, (1+z)^{-1/2}=1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.396.

So D_C ≈ (3e5 /70 ) * 2 * 0.396.

3e5/70 is approximately 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 2: 8.571 Gpc.

Multiply by 0.396: 8.571 * 0.396 ≈ 3.39 Gpc.

Hmm, but again, that's lower than the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the presence of dark energy, the expansion is accelerating, which makes the universe younger and the comoving distance larger than in a matter-only universe. Wait, no, in the presence of dark energy, the expansion accelerates, which would cause the universe to expand more, leading to larger comoving distances?

Wait, dark energy causes the expansion to accelerate, so for a given redshift, the comoving distance might be larger than in a matter-only universe because the expansion is faster at later times, so the light has more time to travel.

Wait, but for high z, the matter term dominates, so the dark energy effect is less. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation for E(z). Let me compute E(z) at some points and do a rough integration.

Let's compute E(z) at several z values between 0 and 5.5, and then perform a trapezoidal integration.

Let's choose steps of 0.5 in z.

But wait, z starts at 0 and goes up to 5.5.

Compute E(z) at z=0, 0.5,1,1.5,...,5.5.

But this is time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

At z=0: E= sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 +0.7*(1)^{-3})= sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1.

z=0.5: (1+z) =1.5.

0.3*(1.5)^3=0.3*(3.375)=1.0125.

0.7*(1.5)^{-3}=0.7/(3.375)≈0.2078.

Sum=1.0125+0.2078=1.2203. sqrt(1.2203)=1.1047.

z=1: (1+z)=2.

0.3*(8)=2.4.

0.7/(8)=0.0875.

Sum=2.4+0.0875=2.4875. sqrt≈1.577.

z=1.5: 1+z=2.5.

0.3*(2.5)^3=0.3*15.625=4.6875.

0.7/(2.5)^3=0.7/(15.625)=0.0448.

Sum=4.6875+0.0448=4.7323. sqrt≈2.175.

z=2: (1+z)=3.

0.3*27=8.1.

0.7/(27)=0.0259.

Sum=8.1259. sqrt≈2.85.

z=2.5: (3.5)^3=42.875. 0.3*42.875=12.8625.

0.7/(42.875)=0.01633.

Sum=12.8788. sqrt≈3.589.

z=3: (4)^3=64. 0.3*64=19.2.

0.7/(64)=0.0109375.

Sum=19.2109. sqrt≈4.383.

z=3.5: (4.5)^3=91.125. 0.3*91.125=27.3375.

0.7/(91.125)=0.00768.

Sum=27.345. sqrt≈5.23.

z=4: (5)^3=125. 0.3*125=37.5.

0.7/(125)=0.0056.

Sum=37.5056. sqrt≈6.12.

z=4.5: (5.5)^3=166.375. 0.3*166.375=49.9125.

0.7/(166.375)=0.004208.

Sum=49.9167. sqrt≈7.065.

z=5: (6)^3=216. 0.3*216=64.8.

0.7/(216)=0.00324.

Sum=64.80324. sqrt≈8.05.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875.

0.7/(274.625)=0.00255.

Sum=82.3875+0.00255=82.39005. sqrt≈9.077.

So now, I have E(z) at various z points. Now, the integrand is 1/E(z). So I can compute 1/E(z) for each z and then perform a trapezoidal integration.

Compute 1/E(z) for each z:

z=0: 1/E=1/1=1.

z=0.5: 1/1.1047≈0.905.

z=1:1/1.577≈0.634.

z=1.5:1/2.175≈0.459.

z=2:1/2.85≈0.3508.

z=2.5:1/3.589≈0.2786.

z=3:1/4.383≈0.2282.

z=3.5:1/5.23≈0.1912.

z=4:1/6.12≈0.1634.

z=4.5:1/7.065≈0.1416.

z=5:1/8.05≈0.1242.

z=5.5:1/9.077≈0.11.

Now, to perform the trapezoidal integration from z=0 to z=5.5 in steps of 0.5.

The formula for the trapezoidal rule is:

Integral ≈ (Δz/2) * [f(z0) + 2f(z1) + 2f(z2) + ... + 2f(z_{n-1}) ) + f(z_n) ]

So for each interval between z_i and z_{i+1}, we compute (z_{i+1}-z_i)/2 * [f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1}) ].

But since the step is 0.5, Δz=0.5 for each step.

Let me break it down:

Number of steps: 12 points (z=0 to 5.5 in 0.5 increments, so 12 points including z=0 and z=5.5).

But wait, from z=0 to z=5.5, with step 0.5, that's 11 steps (5.5 /0.5 =11 steps).

Wait, let me list the z and 1/E(z):

z: 0 → 0.5 →1 →1.5 →2 →2.5 →3 →3.5 →4 →4.5 →5 →5.5.

So 11 intervals between 12 points.

Using the trapezoidal rule for each interval:

Interval 0-0.5: (0.5/2) [1 + 0.905] = 0.25*(1.905)=0.47625.

0.5-1: 0.25*(0.905 +0.634)= 0.25*(1.539)=0.38475.

1-1.5: 0.25*(0.634 +0.459)=0.25*(1.093)=0.27325.

1.5-2: 0.25*(0.459 +0.3508)=0.25*(0.8098)=0.20245.

2-2.5: 0.25*(0.3508 +0.2786)=0.25*(0.6294)=0.15735.

2.5-3: 0.25*(0.2786 +0.2282)=0.25*(0.5068)=0.1267.

3-3.5:0.25*(0.2282 +0.1912)=0.25*(0.4194)=0.10485.

3.5-4:0.25*(0.1912 +0.1634)=0.25*(0.3546)=0.08865.

4-4.5:0.25*(0.1634 +0.1416)=0.25*(0.305)=0.07625.

4.5-5:0.25*(0.1416 +0.1242)=0.25*(0.2658)=0.06645.

5-5.5:0.25*(0.1242 +0.11)=0.25*(0.2342)=0.05855.

Now sum all these up:

0.47625
+0.38475 = 0.861
+0.27325 = 1.13425
+0.20245 =1.3367
+0.15735=1.49405
+0.1267=1.62075
+0.10485=1.7256
+0.08865=1.81425
+0.07625=1.8905
+0.06645=1.95695
+0.05855=2.0155.

So the approximate integral is 2.0155.

Now, D_C = (c/H0) * integral.

c=3e5 km/s.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0=3e5/70 ≈ 4285.714 Mpc.

So D_C=4285.714 Mpc * 2.0155 ≈ Let's compute that.

4285.714 * 2 = 8571.428 Mpc.

4285.714 * 0.0155≈4285.714 *0.01=42.857, 0.005=21.42857, 0.0005=2.14287. So 42.857+21.42857=64.28557 +2.14287≈66.428 Mpc.

So total is 8571.428 +66.428≈8637.856 Mpc.

Convert to Gpc: 8637.856 /1000 ≈8.637856 Gpc.

So approximately 8.6 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, and option C is 9. So 8.6 is closer to 9, but perhaps I made some approximations. Alternatively, the exact calculation might give around 8.5 or 8.6, which would round to 9. But the options don't have 8.5. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc.

Wait, but my approximation using the trapezoidal rule may not be accurate enough. Let's think: the integral from 0 to 5.5 of 1/E(z) dz is approximately 2.0155. But perhaps the actual integral is a bit higher, leading to a comoving distance of around 8.6 Gpc. So the closest option would be 8 Gpc (option B) or 9 Gpc (option C). Alternatively, if the exact calculation is around 8.6, perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

But wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, 8.6 is close to 9, but given that the approximation with the trapezoidal rule using only 11 intervals may have underestimated, perhaps the true value is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)7 Gpc. Hmm, but 8.6 isn't near 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me re-check the trapezoidal sum.

Wait, adding up the intervals again:

First interval (0-0.5): 0.47625.

Next (0.5-1): 0.38475 → sum 0.861.

Then (1-1.5): 0.27325 → sum 1.13425.

Then (1.5-2):0.20245 → sum 1.3367.

Then (2-2.5):0.15735 → sum 1.49405.

Then (2.5-3):0.1267 → sum 1.62075.

Then (3-3.5):0.10485 → sum 1.7256.

Then (3.5-4):0.08865 → sum 1.81425.

Then (4-4.5):0.07625 → sum 1.8905.

Then (4.5-5):0.06645 → sum 1.95695.

Then (5-5.5):0.05855 → sum 2.0155.

So the integral is 2.0155.

Multiply by (3e5/70) Mpc → 4285.714 * 2.0155 ≈8637.85 Mpc → 8.6378 Gpc.

So the comoving distance is about 8.6 Gpc, which would be closer to option C)9 Gpc. But the options don't have 8.5, so perhaps the intended answer is B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I have an error in the way I calculated E(z). Let me double-check E(z) at some points.

Wait, at z=0, E=1. Correct.

z=0.5: (1+0.5)=1.5.

0.3*(1.5)^3=0.3*(3.375)=1.0125.

0.7*(1.5)^{-3}=0.7/(3.375)=0.2077. Sum=1.0125+0.2077=1.2202. sqrt(1.2202)=1.1047. Correct.

z=1: (2)^3=8. 0.3*8=2.4. 0.7/8=0.0875. Sum=2.4875. sqrt=1.577. Correct.

z=2: (3)^3=27. 0.3*27=8.1. 0.7/(27)=0.0259. Sum=8.1259. sqrt=2.85. Correct.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875. 0.7/(274.625)=0.00255. Sum=82.39005. sqrt≈9.077. Correct.

So the E(z) values are correct.

So the integration seems correct, leading to about 8.6 Gpc. So the closest option is B)8 Gpc or C)9 Gpc. But the question's options don't have 8.5, so perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the emission line is incorrect. If the peak is at 790 nm and it's not the Lyman-alpha line, but perhaps another line. For example, if it's the Balmer series, but in that case, the rest wavelength would be longer. Let me think: the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm (rest frame). If observed at 790 nm, then (1+z)=790/656≈1.204. So z=0.204. That would be nearby, but the comoving distance would be much less than the options given. So that's unlikely.

Another possibility: the peak is not an emission line but something else, but the question says it's an emission line, I think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observed peak is due to the Lyman break. The Lyman break occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts absorbs the UV light, making the spectrum drop below a certain wavelength. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is redshifted from 91 nm, then (1+z)=790/91≈8.68. So z≈7.68. That's a higher redshift, which would mean a larger comoving distance.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if the peak is at 790 nm and it's the Lyman limit, then z=7.68, which is higher than before.

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me recalculate for z=7.68.

So for z=7.68, let's compute the comoving distance.

Again, the integral is ∫(0 to 7.68) dz'/E(z').

E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7*(1+z')^{-3} )

Again, perform a trapezoidal integration, but this time up to z=7.68. Let's choose step sizes of 1.0.

Compute E(z) at z=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.68.

But that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for high z, where E(z)≈sqrt(0.3*(z')^3) = sqrt(0.3) z'^(3/2).

So the integral becomes ∫(0 to z) dz'/(sqrt(0.3) z'^(3/2) ) ) = (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ z'^{-3/2} dz' from 0 to z.

The integral of z'^{-3/2} is [ z'^{-1/2} / (-1/2) ] = -2 z'^{-1/2}.

So the integral from 0 to z is [ -2 z'^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z → 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(z) ).

But wait, that's assuming E(z) = sqrt(0.3) z'^{3/2}, which is true for z >>1.

So for z=7.68, the integral is 2 * (1 - 1/sqrt(7.68)) ) ≈ 2*(1 - 0.369) )= 2*0.631=1.262.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1.826, gives 1.262 *1.826≈2.305.

So D_C= (3e5/70) *2.305 ≈4285.7 *2.305≈9862 Mpc →9.86 Gpc.

So if the peak is the Lyman limit, then the comoving distance is about 9.86 Gpc, which would correspond to option C)9 Gpc.

But earlier, when assuming the peak was Lyman-alpha, the distance was about 8.6 Gpc. So if the peak is Lyman-alpha, then the distance is ~8.6 Gpc. If it's the Lyman limit, then ~9.86 Gpc.

But the problem states that the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. That's more consistent with the Lyman break, as the IGM would absorb wavelengths below the Lyman limit. So the peak is at the Lyman break, which would correspond to longer comoving distance.

So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. The peak is at the Lyman break, not the Lyman-alpha line.

In that case, the redshift z is approximately (790 nm /91 nm ) -1 ≈8.68-1=7.68.

So let's recompute the comoving distance for z=7.68.

But to be precise, I'll have to compute the integral more accurately.

Alternatively, what if the peak is the Lyman limit, so z=7.68. Then, using the same approach as before, perhaps the comoving distance is about 10 Gpc, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are up to 9 Gpc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 9 Gpc.

But let me recap: if the observed peak is at 790 nm and it's the Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength 121.6 nm), then z=5.5 and D_C≈8.6 Gpc. If it's the Lyman break (rest 91 nm), then z≈7.68 and D_C≈9.86 Gpc, which would round to 10, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. The question says that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. So the drop occurs below 790 nm, suggesting that the emission is at 790 nm, which would be the Lyman-alpha line, as the Lyman break would cause a sharp drop below a certain wavelength, and the peak would be just above that. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that would be just above the Lyman-break wavelength, which would be at 790*(1+z)=91 nm. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The Lyman-break occurs at (1+z) * 91 nm = observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The Lyman limit is at 91 nm. So any photon with wavelength below that is absorbed. So if the quasar emits light at 91 nm, but the universe's expansion redshifts it to 790 nm, then that would mean (1+z)=790/91≈8.68. So z≈7.68.

So in this case, the peak isn't an emission line but the break in the spectrum due to the IGM absorption. So the redshift would be higher, and the comoving distance would be larger.

So for z=7.68, let's compute the comoving distance.

Again, using the trapezoidal method, but this time up to z=7.68, which would be tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for high z.

At high z, E(z)=sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 )=sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2).

So the integral ∫(0 to z) dz'/(sqrt(0.3)(1+z')^{3/2}) ) ) = (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'.

Let u=1+z', du=dz', integral becomes ∫ u^{-3/2} du from u=1 to u=1+z.

Which is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 1+z.

So integral is 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ) / sqrt(0.3).

Wait, wait, no. Let me recompute.

Integral of u^{-3/2} du is [ -2 u^{-1/2} ].

So from u=1 to u=1+z:

2 (1/sqrt(1) - 1/sqrt(1+z)) ) = 2(1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)).

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3):

Integral = 2(1 -1/sqrt(1+z)) / sqrt(0.3).

So for z=7.68, 1+z=8.68.

sqrt(8.68)=2.946.

So 1/sqrt(8.68)=0.3395.

So 1 -0.3395=0.6605.

So integral= 2 *0.6605 / sqrt(0.3) ≈1.321 /0.5477≈2.411.

Multiply by c/H0: 4285.7 Mpc *2.411≈ 4285.7 *2.411.

Let's compute 4285.7 *2=8571.4.

4285.7 *0.4=1714.28.

4285.7 *0.011≈47.14.

Total≈8571.4+1714.28=10285.68 +47.14=10332.82 Mpc →10.3328 Gpc.

But this is with the assumption that dark energy is negligible. But for z=7.68, which is high, matter dominates, so the approximation holds. So comoving distance is about 10.3 Gpc.

But the options only go up to 9 Gpc, which suggests that perhaps the initial assumption of the Lyman-alpha line is correct, giving a distance of 8.6 Gpc, which is option B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, leading to z=5.5.

But the options don't have 8.6. So perhaps the intended answer is 8 Gpc.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc, option B.

Wait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

So the correct option would be B)8 Gpc.


The problem involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar located at a high redshift, based on observations of its spectrum. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Identifying the Redshift**:  
   The observed peak in the spectrum is at a wavelength of 790 nm. Assuming this corresponds to the Lyman-alpha emission line (rest wavelength = 121.6 nm), the redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{790}{121.6} \approx 6.498 \implies z \approx 5.498
   \]  

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz'
   \]  
   where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda (1+z)^{-3}} \), and the cosmological parameters are \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), and the universe is flat.

3. **Integral Approximation**:  
   For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the matter density term dominates \( E(z) \), so \( E(z) \approx \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3} \). The integral simplifies to:  
   \[
   \int_0^z \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz' \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Omega_m}} \int_0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} \, dz'
   \]  
   This evaluates to:  
   \[
   \int_0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} \, dz' = 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right]
   \]  
   Substituting \( z = 5.5 \):  
   \[
   \int_0^{5.5} \frac{1}{E(z')} \, dz' \approx 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{6.5}} \right] \approx 1.144
   \]  

4. **Calculating \( D_C \)**:  
   Using \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \):  
   \[
   \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc}
   \]  
   Multiplying by the integral result:  
   \[
   D_C = 4285.7 \times 1.144 \approx 4902 \, \text{Mpc} \approx 4.9 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]  

5. **Revisiting the Assumption**:  
   If the observed peak at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman-break (rest wavelength = 91 nm), the redshift would be higher:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{790}{91} \approx 8.68 \implies z \approx 7.68
   \]  
   For \( z \approx 7.68 \), the comoving distance increases due to the higher redshift. Using similar approximations, \( D_C \approx 9.86 \, \text{Gpc} \).

6. **Final Consideration**:  
   The problem states that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm, which is consistent with the Lyman-break feature. Thus, the higher redshift \( z \approx 7.68 \) and corresponding \( D_C \approx 9.86 \, \text{Gpc} \) is more appropriate. However, the closest option provided is **9 Gpc**.
