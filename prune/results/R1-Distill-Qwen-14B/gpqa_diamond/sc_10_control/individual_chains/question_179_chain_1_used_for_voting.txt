Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. They're all 3x3, I think. And the options are about properties of these matrices, like whether they're observables, if they're unitary, or if they represent quantum states or evolution operators.

Hmm, I remember in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So for a matrix to be an observable, it needs to be Hermitian, which means it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Also, the evolution operator is Unitary, which means U†U = I, where † is the conjugate transpose. And for a state vector, it should be normalized, meaning its norm (or length) is 1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X is the exponential of matrix X. I remember that if X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. But if X is Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary because the exponential of an Hermitian matrix is unitary. Wait no, wait, the exponential of an Hermitian matrix is actually unitary only if the matrix is skew-Hermitian, right? Because e^{iH} is unitary when H is Hermitian. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the exponential of a matrix can have different properties. So, the question is whether multiplying by e^X changes the norm of some vector. If e^X is not unitary, then when you multiply a vector by it, the norm could change. So, to check whether e^X is unitary, I need to see if X is skew-Hermitian (because then e^{X} would be unitary). Alternatively, if X is Hermitian, e^{iX} would be unitary, but e^{X} wouldn't be unless X is zero matrix.

Wait, let's see. Matrix X is given as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

I need to check if X is Hermitian. So the conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates.

Conjugate transpose of X:

Row1: (-i)*, 1*, (2i)* → Wait, no, the conjugate transpose of X is the transpose with each element conjugated.

So, original X:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]

Row 2: [1, 0, 1]

Row3: [2i, -1, -i]

Transpose of X would be columns become rows:

Col1: i, 1, 2i → Row1: i, 1, 2i

Col2: -1, 0, -1 → Row2: -1, 0, -1

Col3: 2i, 1, -i → Row3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, taking conjugate of each element:

Conjugate of i is -i; 1 stays 1, 2i becomes -2i.

So, conjugate transpose of X:

Row1: (-i), 1, (-2i)

Row2: (-1), 0, (-1)

Row3: (2i), 1, (i)

Wait, but the original X doesn't match this. Let me compare.

Original X's transpose conjugate is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: 2i, 1, i

Compare to X:

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

Clearly, X is not equal to its conjugate transpose. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, e^X is not unitary. So, multiplying by e^X can change the norm of a vector. So option A says there exists a vector where e^X changes the norm. So that's true, because e^X is not unitary, so there's at least one vector (maybe all vectors?) where the norm changes. So option A is true. Wait, but the question is about the statement being correct. So option A would be a correct statement.

But let me check other options as well.

Option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Hmm, a quantum state is a vector with unit norm. But here it's a product of matrices. So this expression would result in a matrix. Because e^X is a matrix, Y is a matrix, e^{-X} is a matrix. So the product would be a matrix, not a vector. So it can't be a quantum state. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

As observables require Hermitian matrices. So check if Z is Hermitian.

Matrix Z is:

Row1: 3, 2i, 5

Row2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5, 4i,4

Compute the conjugate transpose of Z.

Original Z:

Row1: 3, 2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

Conjugate transpose:

Each element's conjugate, then transpose.

So,

Row1 of conjugate transpose:

3*, (-2i)*,5* → 3, 2i,5

Row2:

(-2i)*, (-2)*, (-4i)* → 2i, -2,4i

Row3:

5*,4i*,4* →5, -4i,4

Wait, no, more precisely, the conjugate transpose (Z†) is the transpose of Z's conjugate.

So, Z's conjugate is:

3, -2i,5

-2i, -2,4i

5, -4i,4

Then transpose:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Wait, that doesn't match Z. Let me construct it properly.

Original Z:

Row 1:3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

The conjugate of Z is:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2:2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Transpose of the conjugate is:

Take rows as columns.

Conjugate Z's row1 becomes column1, row2 becomes column2, etc.

So conjugate Z's first column is 3, 2i,5 → transpose would be row1 of Z†: 3, 2i,5

Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

Z's conjugate:

Row1: 3, -2i,5

Row2: 2i, -2, 4i

Row3:5, -4i,4.

Transpose of this is:

Column1 becomes row1: 3, 2i,5 → row1:3,2i,5.

Column2 becomes row2: -2i, -2, -4i → row2: -2i, -2, -4i.

Column3 becomes row3:5,4i,4 → row3:5,4i,4.

So Z† is:

3   2i    5

-2i -2    -4i

5   4i    4.

Compare this to Z:

Z is:

Row1:3,2i,5

Row2:-2i,-2,-4i

Row3:5,4i,4.

So Z equals Z†, which means Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable.

But X was not Hermitian. So option C says Z and X are observables. Since X is not Hermitian, this statement is false. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

Evolution operators are unitary matrices. So, I need to check if W and X are unitary.

Check if W is unitary.

Matrix W:

Row1:0,0,1

Row2:0,1,0

Row3:1,0,0.

Compute W†W and see if it's identity.

W is:

[ [0,0,1],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,0,0] ]

W† is the same as W since it's real and symmetric.

So W† = W.

Compute W^† W = W^2.

Multiply W by W:

Row 1 of W multiplied by each column.

First row [0,0,1] times first column [0,0,1] → 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1.

First row times second column: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0.

First row times third column: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0.

So first row of W^2 is [1, 0, 0].

Second row of W is [0,1,0].

Multiply by columns:

Second row * first column: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0.

Second row * second column: 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Second row * third column: 0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

So second row is [0,1,0].

Third row of W is [1,0,0].

Multiply by each column:

Third row * first column:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.

Third row * second column:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Third row * third column:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So W^2 is identity matrix. So W is unitary, because W† W = I.

So W is a unitary matrix. So W could be an evolution operator.

What about X?

Is X unitary? Let's check X† X = I?

Compute X† and multiply by X.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2:1,0,1

Row3:2i, -1, -i

Compute X†:

Take conjugate and transpose.

Conjugate of X:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i

Row2:1,0,1

Row3: -2i, -1, i

Transpose of that:

Row1: -i,1,-2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: -2i,1,i

So X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: -2i,1,i

Now multiply X† by X.

Let me compute this product.

X† X = ?

Compute each element:

Let me compute the element (1,1):

(-i)(i) + (1)(-1) + (-2i)(2i).

Compute each term:

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) =1.

(1)(-1) = -1.

(-2i)(2i) = -4i² = -4*(-1)=4.

So sum: 1 -1 +4 =4. So (1,1) is 4.

Hmm, but for unitary, this should be 1. So X† X has (1,1) as 4, which is not 1. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be an evolution operator because evolution operators are unitary matrices.

So option D says W and X are evolution operators. But since X isn't unitary, this statement is false. So option D is incorrect.

Going back to the options:

Option A: True because e^X is not unitary, so some vector's norm changes.

Option B: False because it's a matrix, not a vector.

Option C: False because X isn't Hermitian.

Option D: False because X isn't unitary.

So the correct statement is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices, we analyze each option based on the properties of the matrices:

### Option A:
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes. For \( e^X \) to preserve the norm of all vectors, \( e^X \) must be unitary. A matrix exponential \( e^X \) is unitary if \( X \) is skew-Hermitian. However, \( X \) is not Hermitian (as verified by comparing \( X \) with its conjugate transpose \( X^\dagger \)), and thus \( e^X \) is not unitary. Therefore, there exists at least one vector for which the norm changes when multiplied by \( e^X \). This statement is **true**.

### Option B:
The expression \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) results in a matrix, not a vector. A quantum state is represented by a normalized vector, not a matrix. Hence, this statement is **false**.

### Option C:
For a matrix to represent an observable in quantum mechanics, it must be Hermitian. Matrix \( Z \) is Hermitian, as \( Z = Z^\dagger \). However, matrix \( X \) is not Hermitian, as \( X \neq X^\dagger \). Since \( X \) is not Hermitian, it cannot represent an observable. This statement is **false**.

### Option D:
The evolution operator in quantum mechanics must be unitary, meaning \( U^\dagger U = I \). Matrix \( W \) is unitary because \( W^\dagger W = I \). However, matrix \( X \) is not unitary, as shown by computing \( X^\dagger X \) and finding it is not the identity matrix. Since \( X \) is not unitary, \( W \) and \( X \) cannot both represent the evolution operator of a quantum system. This statement is **false**.

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. They're all 3x3, I think. And the options are about properties of these matrices, like whether they're observables, if they're unitary, or if they represent quantum states or evolution operators.

Hmm, I remember in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So for a matrix to be an observable, it needs to be Hermitian, which means it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Also, the evolution operator is Unitary, which means U†U = I, where † is the conjugate transpose. And for a state vector, it should be normalized, meaning its norm (or length) is 1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X is the exponential of matrix X. I remember that if X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. But if X is Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary because the exponential of an Hermitian matrix is unitary. Wait no, wait, the exponential of an Hermitian matrix is actually unitary only if the matrix is skew-Hermitian, right? Because e^{iH} is unitary when H is Hermitian. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the exponential of a matrix can have different properties. So, the question is whether multiplying by e^X changes the norm of some vector. If e^X is not unitary, then when you multiply a vector by it, the norm could change. So, to check whether e^X is unitary, I need to see if X is skew-Hermitian (because then e^{X} would be unitary). Alternatively, if X is Hermitian, e^{iX} would be unitary, but e^{X} wouldn't be unless X is zero matrix.

Wait, let's see. Matrix X is given as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

I need to check if X is Hermitian. So the conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates.

Conjugate transpose of X:

Row1: (-i)*, 1*, (2i)* → Wait, no, the conjugate transpose of X is the transpose with each element conjugated.

So, original X:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]

Row 2: [1, 0, 1]

Row3: [2i, -1, -i]

Transpose of X would be columns become rows:

Col1: i, 1, 2i → Row1: i, 1, 2i

Col2: -1, 0, -1 → Row2: -1, 0, -1

Col3: 2i, 1, -i → Row3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, taking conjugate of each element:

Conjugate of i is -i; 1 stays 1, 2i becomes -2i.

So, conjugate transpose of X:

Row1: (-i), 1, (-2i)

Row2: (-1), 0, (-1)

Row3: (2i), 1, (i)

Wait, but the original X doesn't match this. Let me compare.

Original X's transpose conjugate is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: 2i, 1, i

Compare to X:

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

Clearly, X is not equal to its conjugate transpose. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, e^X is not unitary. So, multiplying by e^X can change the norm of a vector. So option A says there exists a vector where e^X changes the norm. So that's true, because e^X is not unitary, so there's at least one vector (maybe all vectors?) where the norm changes. So option A is true. Wait, but the question is about the statement being correct. So option A would be a correct statement.

But let me check other options as well.

Option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Hmm, a quantum state is a vector with unit norm. But here it's a product of matrices. So this expression would result in a matrix. Because e^X is a matrix, Y is a matrix, e^{-X} is a matrix. So the product would be a matrix, not a vector. So it can't be a quantum state. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

As observables require Hermitian matrices. So check if Z is Hermitian.

Matrix Z is:

Row1: 3, 2i, 5

Row2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5, 4i,4

Compute the conjugate transpose of Z.

Original Z:

Row1: 3, 2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

Conjugate transpose:

Each element's conjugate, then transpose.

So,

Row1 of conjugate transpose:

3*, (-2i)*,5* → 3, 2i,5

Row2:

(-2i)*, (-2)*, (-4i)* → 2i, -2,4i

Row3:

5*,4i*,4* →5, -4i,4

Wait, no, more precisely, the conjugate transpose (Z†) is the transpose of Z's conjugate.

So, Z's conjugate is:

3, -2i,5

-2i, -2,4i

5, -4i,4

Then transpose:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Wait, that doesn't match Z. Let me construct it properly.

Original Z:

Row 1:3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

The conjugate of Z is:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2:2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Transpose of the conjugate is:

Take rows as columns.

Conjugate Z's row1 becomes column1, row2 becomes column2, etc.

So conjugate Z's first column is 3, 2i,5 → transpose would be row1 of Z†: 3, 2i,5

Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

Z's conjugate:

Row1: 3, -2i,5

Row2: 2i, -2, 4i

Row3:5, -4i,4.

Transpose of this is:

Column1 becomes row1: 3, 2i,5 → row1:3,2i,5.

Column2 becomes row2: -2i, -2, -4i → row2: -2i, -2, -4i.

Column3 becomes row3:5,4i,4 → row3:5,4i,4.

So Z† is:

3   2i    5

-2i -2    -4i

5   4i    4.

Compare this to Z:

Z is:

Row1:3,2i,5

Row2:-2i,-2,-4i

Row3:5,4i,4.

So Z equals Z†, which means Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable.

But X was not Hermitian. So option C says Z and X are observables. Since X is not Hermitian, this statement is false. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

Evolution operators are unitary matrices. So, I need to check if W and X are unitary.

Check if W is unitary.

Matrix W:

Row1:0,0,1

Row2:0,1,0

Row3:1,0,0.

Compute W†W and see if it's identity.

W is:

[ [0,0,1],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,0,0] ]

W† is the same as W since it's real and symmetric.

So W† = W.

Compute W^† W = W^2.

Multiply W by W:

Row 1 of W multiplied by each column.

First row [0,0,1] times first column [0,0,1] → 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1.

First row times second column: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0.

First row times third column: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0.

So first row of W^2 is [1, 0, 0].

Second row of W is [0,1,0].

Multiply by columns:

Second row * first column: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0.

Second row * second column: 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Second row * third column: 0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

So second row is [0,1,0].

Third row of W is [1,0,0].

Multiply by each column:

Third row * first column:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.

Third row * second column:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Third row * third column:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So W^2 is identity matrix. So W is unitary, because W† W = I.

So W is a unitary matrix. So W could be an evolution operator.

What about X?

Is X unitary? Let's check X† X = I?

Compute X† and multiply by X.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2:1,0,1

Row3:2i, -1, -i

Compute X†:

Take conjugate and transpose.

Conjugate of X:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i

Row2:1,0,1

Row3: -2i, -1, i

Transpose of that:

Row1: -i,1,-2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: -2i,1,i

So X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: -2i,1,i

Now multiply X† by X.

Let me compute this product.

X† X = ?

Compute each element:

Let me compute the element (1,1):

(-i)(i) + (1)(-1) + (-2i)(2i).

Compute each term:

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) =1.

(1)(-1) = -1.

(-2i)(2i) = -4i² = -4*(-1)=4.

So sum: 1 -1 +4 =4. So (1,1) is 4.

Hmm, but for unitary, this should be 1. So X† X has (1,1) as 4, which is not 1. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be an evolution operator because evolution operators are unitary matrices.

So option D says W and X are evolution operators. But since X isn't unitary, this statement is false. So option D is incorrect.

Going back to the options:

Option A: True because e^X is not unitary, so some vector's norm changes.

Option B: False because it's a matrix, not a vector.

Option C: False because X isn't Hermitian.

Option D: False because X isn't unitary.

So the correct statement is option A.


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices, we analyze each option based on the properties of the matrices:

### Option A:
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes. For \( e^X \) to preserve the norm of all vectors, \( e^X \) must be unitary.
