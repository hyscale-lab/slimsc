Alright, so I have this physics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, let me break down what the problem is asking. I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving object isn't just its rest mass energy; it's higher because of its kinetic energy. So, I think I'll need to use the gamma factor here.

Wait, what's gamma again? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, I should plug that in.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's see, v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared, which is 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, approximately. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.5714. Wait, maybe I should be more precise because the options have four decimal places. Let me get the exact value.

Wait, 0.0784 is 196/2500, since 14^2 is 196 and 50^2 is 2500. Hmm, but maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, let me use a calculator approach. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly? Let me check. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes! So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately to avoid approximation errors. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)), which is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714286 exactly? Wait, no, wait. Wait 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly? Yes, because 28^2 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 0.96 squared again. 0.96 * 0.96: 96 * 96 is 9216, so yes, 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of that is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons, I think. Wait, wait, no: Li is lithium. The standard isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Oh, wait, the question says Li with 3 neutrons. So that's Li-3? Hmm, wait, that's unusual because Li-3 is not very stable, but perhaps the question is referring to that.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard isotope of lithium is Li-7. So if the nucleus has 3 neutrons, then it's Li-3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, Li has 3 protons. So number of neutrons is 3, so the mass number A is 3 +3 =6? Oh wait, no. Wait, no, Li has 3 protons, so if it's 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. Oh, wait, no: 3 protons and 3 neutrons give a mass number of 6, so it's Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, but I thought Li-7 is more common, but I'll proceed with what the problem says: the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So the mass number is 6.

So the rest mass energy would be the mass of Li-6 times c squared. But in particle physics, we usually express energies in GeV, so I'll need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus in GeV/c².

Wait, but how do I find the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus in GeV/c²? Hmm, perhaps I can compute it from the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Because, I recall that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Wait, but wait, that's just the sum of individual nucleons. However, because of binding energy, the actual mass of the nucleus is less, due to mass defect. But maybe for a rough calculation, the mass of the nucleus can be approximated as (number of protons + neutrons) times the average mass of a nucleon, minus a small binding energy term. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact atomic mass including electrons.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of a Li-6 atom. Because the problem is about the nucleus, I can subtract the mass of the electrons. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the atomic mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. Let me confirm that. I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Since a Li atom has 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.00054858 u. So the total mass of the electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.0016457 u.

So the mass of the nucleus (Li-6) is 6.0151 u - 0.0016457 u ≈ 6.013454 u.

Wait, but maybe I can find a more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the mass of the nucleus as the mass number times the average nucleon mass, adjusted for binding energy. But perhaps for this problem, I can use the known mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus as (A * m_nucleon) minus binding energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of the nucleus from the atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed to compute it. Let me go ahead.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u. The mass of the nucleus (M) is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Each electron is about 0.00054858 u, as I said. So for 3 electrons, 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass M = 6.0151 - 0.0016457 = approximately 6.013454 u.

Now, I need to convert this mass into energy in GeV. Because E = gamma * m c².

But first, I should convert the mass from u to kg, then to GeV/c². Because I know that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Then, using E=mc², where c is 3e8 m/s.

Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor between atomic mass units and GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013454 u. Converting that to GeV/c²: 6.013454 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV/c².

0.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01251 GeV/c².

So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.01251 = 5.6015 GeV/c².

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Wait, no, because 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c², so 6 u would be about 5.589 GeV. So 6.013454 u would be about 6.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute it accurately.

Compute 6.013454 * 0.9315.

Let me compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315. 0.003454 * 0.9315 ≈ approx 0.003211. So total for the 0.013454 term is about 0.009315 + 0.003211 = 0.012526.

So total mass energy is 5.589 + 0.012526 ≈ 5.6015 GeV/c².

Wait, but that would be the rest mass energy of the nucleus. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by that.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, as computed earlier.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.6015.

Let me compute 3 *5.6015 =16.8045.

0.5714 *5.6015 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.6015 = 2.80075.

0.0714 *5.6015 ≈ approx 0.0714 *5 = 0.357, 0.0714 *0.6015≈0.04295. So total around 0.4.

So 0.5714 *5.6015 ≈ 2.80075 + 0.357 + 0.04295 ≈ 3.1995.

So total E is 16.8045 + 3.1995 ≈ 19.999 GeV, which is about 20 GeV.

Wait, but the options are more precise. Let me be more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.5714 *5.6015 more accurately.

Let me write 3.5714 as a fraction. 3.5714 is approximately 3.57142857, which is exactly 25/7. Because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6015.

Hmm, 25/7 is approximately 3.5714.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 5.6015 * 3.57142857.

5.6015 *3 =16.8045.

5.6015 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7, approximately. Let me compute 5.6015 *4/7.

5.6015 *4 = 22.406.

Divide by 7: 22.406 /7 ≈ 3.200857.

So the total is 16.8045 +3.200857=20.005357 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, B is 23.069, D is 21.419, and A is 18.475.

Wait, none of the options are exactly 20 GeV. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck my steps.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons: total mass number is 6 (Li-6). So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u.

But when calculating the mass of the nucleus, I subtract the electrons' mass. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the nucleus's actual mass. But another approach is to use the mass of the atom and then calculate the rest mass energy, which includes the electrons. Wait, but in particle physics, when we talk about the rest mass of a nucleus, I think we take the rest mass of the nucleus itself, not including the electrons. So perhaps I should not subtract the electrons, but rather find the mass of the nucleus from the atomic mass. But I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the mass of the nucleus as the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Because the atomic mass includes the electrons, but the nucleus doesn't have them. So the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So for Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.0151 u. The mass of 3 electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.0151 - 0.0016457 = 6.013454 u.

Then converting to GeV/c²: 6.013454 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.9315 =5.589.

0.013454 *0.9315 = let's compute it more accurately.

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.003454 *0.9315.

0.003 *0.9315=0.0027945.

0.000454 *0.9315 ≈ 0.000423.

So total for 0.003454 is 0.0027945 + 0.000423 ≈ 0.0032175.

So 0.013454 *0.9315 =0.009315 + 0.0032175 = 0.0125325.

So total mass energy is 5.589 + 0.0125325 ≈ 5.6015325 GeV/c².

Then, the total energy E is gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6015325.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6015325.

Let me compute 3 *5.6015325=16.8045975.

0.57142857 *5.6015325.

Compute 0.5 *5.6015325=2.80076625.

0.07142857 *5.6015325.

0.07 *5.6015325=0.392107275.

0.00142857 *5.6015325≈0.007999995.

So adding those: 0.392107275 + 0.007999995 ≈0.40010727.

So total for 0.07142857 part is approx 0.40010727.

So the 0.57142857 *5.6015325 is 2.80076625 +0.40010727 ≈3.20087352.

Adding to the 3* part: 16.8045975 +3.20087352=20.005471 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the precise atomic mass of Li-6. I think it's about 6.0151 u. Let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact gamma value. Wait, I approximated gamma as 3.57142857, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma again. v =0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, according to standard tables, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512275 u.

So the mass of the nucleus would be 6.01512275 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron is 0.00054858 u, so 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.01512275 - 0.00164574 =6.01347701 u.

Converting to GeV/c²: 6.01347701 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Wait, I used 0.9315 GeV/u earlier, but the more precise value is approximately 931.494 MeV/u, which is 0.931494 GeV/u.

So 6.01347701 *0.931494 = ?

Let's compute this precisely.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.01347701 *0.931494.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00347701 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.00047701 *0.931494≈0.0004453.

So total for 0.00347701 is 0.002794482 +0.0004453≈0.00323978.

So 0.01347701 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.00323978=0.01255472.

So total mass energy is 5.588964 +0.01255472=5.60151872 GeV/c².

Now, multiply by gamma (3.5714285714) to get E.

E=3.5714285714 *5.60151872.

Let me compute this accurately.

3 *5.60151872=16.80455616.

0.5714285714 *5.60151872.

0.5 *5.60151872=2.80075936.

0.0714285714 *5.60151872.

Compute 0.07 *5.60151872=0.39210631.

0.0014285714 *5.60151872≈0.0079999999.

So 0.0714285714 *5.60151872=0.39210631 +0.0079999999≈0.4001063.

So 0.5714285714 *5.60151872=2.80075936 +0.4001063=3.20086566.

Adding to the 3 * part: 16.80455616 +3.20086566=20.00542182 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options match exactly 20.0054 GeV. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the gamma calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma value. Let me recheck.

Wait, v is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not 6.013477 u. Let me look up the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) and multiply by the number of nucleons, but that approach ignores binding energy. Let me see what happens if I do that.

Wait, but that would be an approximation, and the options are precise to four decimal places, so perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus using the exact atomic mass.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.01512275 u. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.01512275 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, each electron is 0.0005485799 u. So 3 electrons are 0.0016457397 u.

So mass of nucleus: 6.01512275 -0.0016457397=6.01347601 u.

Convert to GeV/c²: 6.01347601 * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Compute 6 *0.931494=5.588964 GeV/c².

0.01347601 *0.931494 GeV/c².

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00347601 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.00047601 *0.931494≈0.0004454.

So 0.00347601 *0.931494≈0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

So total for 0.01347601 is 0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822.

So total mass energy is 5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV/c².

Then, E = gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute 3 *5.60151882=16.80455646.

0.57142857 *5.60151882.

0.5 *5.60151882=2.80075941.

0.07142857 *5.60151882.

0.07 *5.60151882=0.392106317.

0.00142857 *5.60151882≈0.0079999998.

So total for 0.07142857 part is 0.392106317 +0.0079999998=0.400106317.

So 0.57142857 *5.60151882=2.80075941 +0.400106317=3.200865727.

Adding to 3 * part: 16.80455646 +3.200865727=20.00542219 GeV.

So E≈20.0054 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no, the question says the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, no, RHIC's energy per beam is typically given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Wait, in particle colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, it's the total energy. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in high-energy physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is often given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or sometimes, the kinetic energy is given as the total energy minus the rest mass.

Wait, to clarify, the total energy E = gamma * m c². The kinetic energy K is E - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

So perhaps I should compute K = (gamma -1)*m c².

Wait, because in colliders, the energy often refers to the kinetic energy. So let me try that.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

Mass energy m c² is 5.60151882 GeV.

So K =2.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute that.

2 *5.60151882=11.20303764.

0.57142857 *5.60151882=3.20086572 (as computed earlier).

So K=11.20303764 +3.20086572=14.40390336 GeV.

Hmm, that would be about 14.4 GeV. But the options are higher than that. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, the options are around 20 GeV, which is the E I computed earlier. So the total energy is about 20 GeV.

But none of the options are 20 GeV. The closest is option C (20.132 GeV), but my calculation is 20.005 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculations. Let me recalculate using more precise numbers.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01347601 u.

Each u is exactly 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01347601 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

m=6.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute that.

6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 =approx 0.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27.

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27=1.6605390666e-29.

0.00347601 *1.6605390666e-27=approx 5.775e-30 (exact calculation needed).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 6.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

But perhaps it's easier to compute m c² in joules and then convert to GeV.

c is 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So E = gamma * m c².

But perhaps it's easier to compute m c² in GeV.

m =6.01347601 u.

1 u = 0.931494 GeV/c².

So m c²=6.01347601 *0.931494 GeV.

As computed earlier, that's approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Hmm, so when I compute gamma * m c², I get 3.57142857 *5.6015 ≈20.005 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is 20.132 GeV, but my calculation is a bit off due to approximations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma factor more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v^2/c^2 =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, no issue there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60151882 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60151882.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60151882.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.00151882.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.001 =0.00357142857.

3.57142857 *0.00051882≈0.00185714285.

So 3.57142857 *0.00151882≈0.00357142857 +0.00185714285≈0.00542857142.

So 3.57142857 *0.60151882≈2.14285714 +0.00542857142≈2.14828571.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.14828571=20.00542856 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0054 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the nucleus can be found using the formula:

mass_defect = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - M_nucleus.

But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact binding energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the fact that the mass of the nucleus is (Z + N) * average_nucleon_mass - binding_energy/c².

But perhaps that's too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact binding energy of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption that the nucleus is Li-6. Wait, the problem says "Li with 3 neutrons." So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons: Li-6. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can use the exact value of the mass from a precise table.

According to the table, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013476 amu.

Wait, so m c² is 6.013476 * 0.931494 GeV =5.60151872 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60151872=20.005422 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places, but the options are given to four. So 20.0054 GeV is approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.013476 u but higher.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass of Li-6.

Looking it up, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512275 u. So the nucleus's mass is 6.01512275 u minus 3 *0.0005485799 u.

So 6.01512275 -0.0016457397 =6.01347601 u.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Since v=0.96c, beta=0.96 exactly.

So beta=0.96, beta squared is 0.9216, 1-beta squared is 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Thus, gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

Hmm, that's exact.

So gamma is 3.5714285714285714.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.5714285714285714 *5.60151872.

Which is approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton and neutron, not the nucleus. No, the problem is about the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single Li nucleus, but perhaps it's considering the charge state, like Li+ or something. For example, if the nucleus has lost an electron, but I don't think that affects the mass much.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

If E=20.005 GeV is the total energy, then the kinetic energy is E - m c²=20.005 -5.6015=14.4035 GeV.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the nucleus's mass. Maybe I should use the exact binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact mass of the nucleus using the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should not subtract the electrons' mass because the rest mass of the nucleus is calculated from the atomic mass. Hmm, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons, so the nucleus's mass is atomic mass minus electrons.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should not subtract the electrons, but instead, the nucleus's mass is the same as the atomic mass. But that can't be right because the nucleus doesn't have the electrons bound to it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass directly, considering that the electrons are part of the atom, but not the nucleus. So the nucleus's rest mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.127 GeV higher than my calculation of 20.005 GeV. That's about a 0.6% difference.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is slightly higher due to more precise calculations, or perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the conversion from u to GeV/c². Let me check that.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² =0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013476 u =6.013476 *0.931494 GeV/c².

Compute this accurately.

6 *0.931494=5.588964 GeV.

0.013476 *0.931494.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.003476 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.000476 *0.931494=approx 0.0004454.

So 0.003476 *0.931494≈0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

Total for 0.013476 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822 GeV.

So total m c²=5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60151882=20.005422 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing where the error is.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-7, which has 4 neutrons. Wait, the question says 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a Li-7 nucleus, but that would be 7 u minus electrons, but that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the energy using the rest mass in kilograms.

Let me try that.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.013476 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m=6.013476 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

m=6 *1.6605390666e-27=9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.013476 *1.6605390666e-27=0.013476 *1.6605390666e-27≈2.237e-29 kg.

So m ≈9.9632343996e-27 +2.237e-29 ≈9.9856e-27 kg.

Now, c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

E=gamma * m c².

Gamma=3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *9.9856e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Compute c²: (2.99792458e8)^2≈8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So E=3.5714285714 *9.9856e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Compute 9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 =9.9856 *8.987551787e-10 ≈90.826e-10 =9.0826e-9 J.

Now, E=3.5714285714 *9.0826e-9 J ≈3.5714285714 *9.0826e-9 ≈32.45e-9 J.

Convert Joules to GeV: 1 eV =1.60218e-19 J.

So 1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.

So E=32.45e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈32.45e-9 /1.60218e-10 ≈202 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way off. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 9.9856e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, (2.99792458e8)^2 =8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So 9.9856e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s² =9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.9856 *8.987551787) *1e-27+16 = (approx 90.826) *1e-11 =9.0826e-10 J.

Now, multiply by gamma: 3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10 J=32.45e-10 J=3.245e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV: 3.245e-9 J / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) =approx 20.25 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.25 GeV.

Wait, that's closer to option C:20.132 GeV, but still not matching exactly.

Hmm, perhaps my approximation is leading to this. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, computing 9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16.

9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.9856 *8.987551787) *1e-27 +16 = (approx 90.826) *1e-11=9.0826e-10 J.

Then, 3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10 =3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *9.0826.

3 *9.0826=27.2478.

0.5714285714 *9.0826.

0.5 *9.0826=4.5413.

0.0714285714 *9.0826≈0.6483.

So total for 0.5714285714 part is 4.5413 +0.6483=5.1896.

So total is 27.2478 +5.1896=32.4374.

So E=32.4374e-10 J =3.24374e-9 J.

Convert to GeV:3.24374e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV =3.24374e-9 /1.60218e-10 ≈20.25 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.25 GeV. Closer to option C (20.132), but still not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation leads to 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 23.069 GeV, but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me compute the mass again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of each proton is approximately 1.007276 u.

Each neutron is approximately 1.008665 u.

So total mass of nucleons:3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013476 u.

The mass defect is 6.047823 -6.013476 =0.034347 u.

Which corresponds to binding energy: 0.034347 u *931.494 MeV/u ≈32.09 MeV.

But perhaps this approach is not helpful for the current calculation.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the energy should be around 20 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Perhaps I missed some decimal points in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation of gamma is:

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So with gamma accurately known, perhaps the precise calculation would yield 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m c² with more precise values.

m c²=5.60151882 GeV.

gamma=3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.60151882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 *0.00151882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.001=0.0035714285714.

3.5714285714 *0.00051882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.0005=0.0017857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.00001882≈approx 0.000067304.

So 3.5714285714 *0.00051882≈0.0017857142857 +0.000067304≈0.001853018.

So 3.5714285714 *0.00151882≈0.0035714285714 +0.001853018≈0.005424446.

So 3.5714285714 *0.60151882≈2.14285714284 +0.005424446≈2.148281589.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.148281589≈20.00542445 GeV.

Hmm, that's still about 20.0054 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I should use the rest mass of the individual nucleons, not the nucleus.

But that approach would give a much higher energy, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with the mass of the proton plus neutron, but that doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, due to a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m c² with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is 6.013476 u, which is 6.013476 *0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013476 *0.931494.

Let me compute this precisely.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.013476 *0.931494.

Break it down:

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.003476 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.000476 *0.931494=0.0004454.

So 0.003476 *0.931494=0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

So total for 0.013476 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822.

So m c²=5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV.

Now, E=3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with high precision.

Calculate 3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Break it into 3.5 *5.60151882 + 0.0714285714 *5.60151882.

3.5 *5.60151882 = 19.60531587.

0.0714285714 *5.60151882.

Compute 0.07 *5.60151882 = 0.3921063174.

0.0014285714 *5.60151882 ≈0.0079999999.

So total for 0.0714285714 part is 0.3921063174 +0.0079999999 ≈0.4001063173.

So E=19.60531587 +0.4001063173 =20.005422187 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure where the discrepancy comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, and the energy is given per nucleon. No, the problem states the nucleus's speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma m_p c², where m_p is the proton mass, but that doesn't make sense for a nucleus.

Hmm, I'm not seeing where the error is. Based on my calculations, the energy is approximately 20.005 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but that doesn't align with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but perhaps I should be using beta =v/c=0.96, which I did.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV. Maybe I made a minor miscalculation earlier that's leading to a slight discrepancy.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a moving object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01512275 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The mass of 3 electrons is subtracted to find the nucleus's mass:

\[
\text{Mass of 3 electrons} = 3 \times 0.0005485799 \, \text{u} = 0.0016457397 \, \text{u}
\]

\[
\text{Mass of Li-6 nucleus} = 6.01512275 \, \text{u} - 0.0016457397 \, \text{u} = 6.01347601 \, \text{u}
\]

Convert this to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01347601 \times 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \approx 5.6015 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6015 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.005 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.005 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

The closest match to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, likely due to rounding or slight approximations in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I have this physics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, let me break down what the problem is asking. I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving object isn't just its rest mass energy; it's higher because of its kinetic energy. So, I think I'll need to use the gamma factor here.

Wait, what's gamma again? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, I should plug that in.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's see, v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared, which is 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, approximately. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.5714. Wait, maybe I should be more precise because the options have four decimal places. Let me get the exact value.

Wait, 0.0784 is 196/2500, since 14^2 is 196 and 50^2 is 2500. Hmm, but maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, let me use a calculator approach. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly? Let me check. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes! So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately to avoid approximation errors. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)), which is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714286 exactly? Wait, no, wait. Wait 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly? Yes, because 28^2 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 0.96 squared again. 0.96 * 0.96: 96 * 96 is 9216, so yes, 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of that is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons, I think. Wait, wait, no: Li is lithium. The standard isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Oh, wait, the question says Li with 3 neutrons. So that's Li-3? Hmm, wait, that's unusual because Li-3 is not very stable, but perhaps the question is referring to that.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard isotope of lithium is Li-7. So if the nucleus has 3 neutrons, then it's Li-3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, Li has 3 protons. So number of neutrons is 3, so the mass number A is 3 +3 =6? Oh wait, no. Wait, no, Li has 3 protons, so if it's 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. Oh, wait, no: 3 protons and 3 neutrons give a mass number of 6, so it's Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, but I thought Li-7 is more common, but I'll proceed with what the problem says: the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So the mass number is 6.

So the rest mass energy would be the mass of Li-6 times c squared. But in particle physics, we usually express energies in GeV, so I'll need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus in GeV/c².

Wait, but how do I find the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus in GeV/c²? Hmm, perhaps I can compute it from the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Because, I recall that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Wait, but wait, that's just the sum of individual nucleons. However, because of binding energy, the actual mass of the nucleus is less, due to mass defect. But maybe for a rough calculation, the mass of the nucleus can be approximated as (number of protons + neutrons) times the average mass of a nucleon, minus a small binding energy term. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact atomic mass including electrons.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of a Li-6 atom. Because the problem is about the nucleus, I can subtract the mass of the electrons. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the atomic mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. Let me confirm that. I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Since a Li atom has 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.00054858 u. So the total mass of the electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.0016457 u.

So the mass of the nucleus (Li-6) is 6.0151 u - 0.0016457 u ≈ 6.013454 u.

Wait, but maybe I can find a more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the mass of the nucleus as the mass number times the average nucleon mass, adjusted for binding energy. But perhaps for this problem, I can use the known mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus as (A * m_nucleon) minus binding energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of the nucleus from the atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed to compute it. Let me go ahead.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u. The mass of the nucleus (M) is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Each electron is about 0.00054858 u, as I said. So for 3 electrons, 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass M = 6.0151 - 0.0016457 = approximately 6.013454 u.

Now, I need to convert this mass into energy in GeV. Because E = gamma * m c².

But first, I should convert the mass from u to kg, then to GeV/c². Because I know that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Then, using E=mc², where c is 3e8 m/s.

Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor between atomic mass units and GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013454 u. Converting that to GeV/c²: 6.013454 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV/c².

0.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01251 GeV/c².

So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.01251 = 5.6015 GeV/c².

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Wait, no, because 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c², so 6 u would be about 5.589 GeV. So 6.013454 u would be about 6.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute it accurately.

Compute 6.013454 * 0.9315.

Let me compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.013454 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315. 0.003454 * 0.9315 ≈ approx 0.003211. So total for the 0.013454 term is about 0.009315 + 0.003211 = 0.012526.

So total mass energy is 5.589 + 0.012526 ≈ 5.6015 GeV/c².

Wait, but that would be the rest mass energy of the nucleus. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by that.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, as computed earlier.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.6015.

Let me compute 3 *5.6015 =16.8045.

0.5714 *5.6015 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.6015 = 2.80075.

0.0714 *5.6015 ≈ approx 0.0714 *5 = 0.357, 0.0714 *0.6015≈0.04295. So total around 0.4.

So 0.5714 *5.6015 ≈ 2.80075 + 0.357 + 0.04295 ≈ 3.1995.

So total E is 16.8045 + 3.1995 ≈ 19.999 GeV, which is about 20 GeV.

Wait, but the options are more precise. Let me be more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.5714 *5.6015 more accurately.

Let me write 3.5714 as a fraction. 3.5714 is approximately 3.57142857, which is exactly 25/7. Because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6015.

Hmm, 25/7 is approximately 3.5714.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 5.6015 * 3.57142857.

5.6015 *3 =16.8045.

5.6015 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7, approximately. Let me compute 5.6015 *4/7.

5.6015 *4 = 22.406.

Divide by 7: 22.406 /7 ≈ 3.200857.

So the total is 16.8045 +3.200857=20.005357 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, B is 23.069, D is 21.419, and A is 18.475.

Wait, none of the options are exactly 20 GeV. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck my steps.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons: total mass number is 6 (Li-6). So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u.

But when calculating the mass of the nucleus, I subtract the electrons' mass. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the nucleus's actual mass. But another approach is to use the mass of the atom and then calculate the rest mass energy, which includes the electrons. Wait, but in particle physics, when we talk about the rest mass of a nucleus, I think we take the rest mass of the nucleus itself, not including the electrons. So perhaps I should not subtract the electrons, but rather find the mass of the nucleus from the atomic mass. But I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the mass of the nucleus as the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Because the atomic mass includes the electrons, but the nucleus doesn't have them. So the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So for Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.0151 u. The mass of 3 electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.0151 - 0.0016457 = 6.013454 u.

Then converting to GeV/c²: 6.013454 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.9315 =5.589.

0.013454 *0.9315 = let's compute it more accurately.

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.003454 *0.9315.

0.003 *0.9315=0.0027945.

0.000454 *0.9315 ≈ 0.000423.

So total for 0.003454 is 0.0027945 + 0.000423 ≈ 0.0032175.

So 0.013454 *0.9315 =0.009315 + 0.0032175 = 0.0125325.

So total mass energy is 5.589 + 0.0125325 ≈ 5.6015325 GeV/c².

Then, the total energy E is gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6015325.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6015325.

Let me compute 3 *5.6015325=16.8045975.

0.57142857 *5.6015325.

Compute 0.5 *5.6015325=2.80076625.

0.07142857 *5.6015325.

0.07 *5.6015325=0.392107275.

0.00142857 *5.6015325≈0.007999995.

So adding those: 0.392107275 + 0.007999995 ≈0.40010727.

So total for 0.07142857 part is approx 0.40010727.

So the 0.57142857 *5.6015325 is 2.80076625 +0.40010727 ≈3.20087352.

Adding to the 3* part: 16.8045975 +3.20087352=20.005471 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the precise atomic mass of Li-6. I think it's about 6.0151 u. Let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact gamma value. Wait, I approximated gamma as 3.57142857, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma again. v =0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, according to standard tables, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512275 u.

So the mass of the nucleus would be 6.01512275 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron is 0.00054858 u, so 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.01512275 - 0.00164574 =6.01347701 u.

Converting to GeV/c²: 6.01347701 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Wait, I used 0.9315 GeV/u earlier, but the more precise value is approximately 931.494 MeV/u, which is 0.931494 GeV/u.

So 6.01347701 *0.931494 = ?

Let's compute this precisely.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.01347701 *0.931494.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00347701 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.00047701 *0.931494≈0.0004453.

So total for 0.00347701 is 0.002794482 +0.0004453≈0.00323978.

So 0.01347701 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.00323978=0.01255472.

So total mass energy is 5.588964 +0.01255472=5.60151872 GeV/c².

Now, multiply by gamma (3.5714285714) to get E.

E=3.5714285714 *5.60151872.

Let me compute this accurately.

3 *5.60151872=16.80455616.

0.5714285714 *5.60151872.

0.5 *5.60151872=2.80075936.

0.0714285714 *5.60151872.

Compute 0.07 *5.60151872=0.39210631.

0.0014285714 *5.60151872≈0.0079999999.

So 0.0714285714 *5.60151872=0.39210631 +0.0079999999≈0.4001063.

So 0.5714285714 *5.60151872=2.80075936 +0.4001063=3.20086566.

Adding to the 3 * part: 16.80455616 +3.20086566=20.00542182 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options match exactly 20.0054 GeV. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the gamma calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma value. Let me recheck.

Wait, v is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not 6.013477 u. Let me look up the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) and multiply by the number of nucleons, but that approach ignores binding energy. Let me see what happens if I do that.

Wait, but that would be an approximation, and the options are precise to four decimal places, so perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus using the exact atomic mass.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.01512275 u. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.01512275 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, each electron is 0.0005485799 u. So 3 electrons are 0.0016457397 u.

So mass of nucleus: 6.01512275 -0.0016457397=6.01347601 u.

Convert to GeV/c²: 6.01347601 * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Compute 6 *0.931494=5.588964 GeV/c².

0.01347601 *0.931494 GeV/c².

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00347601 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.00047601 *0.931494≈0.0004454.

So 0.00347601 *0.931494≈0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

So total for 0.01347601 is 0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822.

So total mass energy is 5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV/c².

Then, E = gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute 3 *5.60151882=16.80455646.

0.57142857 *5.60151882.

0.5 *5.60151882=2.80075941.

0.07142857 *5.60151882.

0.07 *5.60151882=0.392106317.

0.00142857 *5.60151882≈0.0079999998.

So total for 0.07142857 part is 0.392106317 +0.0079999998=0.400106317.

So 0.57142857 *5.60151882=2.80075941 +0.400106317=3.200865727.

Adding to 3 * part: 16.80455646 +3.200865727=20.00542219 GeV.

So E≈20.0054 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no, the question says the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, no, RHIC's energy per beam is typically given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Wait, in particle colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, it's the total energy. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in high-energy physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is often given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or sometimes, the kinetic energy is given as the total energy minus the rest mass.

Wait, to clarify, the total energy E = gamma * m c². The kinetic energy K is E - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

So perhaps I should compute K = (gamma -1)*m c².

Wait, because in colliders, the energy often refers to the kinetic energy. So let me try that.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

Mass energy m c² is 5.60151882 GeV.

So K =2.57142857 *5.60151882.

Let me compute that.

2 *5.60151882=11.20303764.

0.57142857 *5.60151882=3.20086572 (as computed earlier).

So K=11.20303764 +3.20086572=14.40390336 GeV.

Hmm, that would be about 14.4 GeV. But the options are higher than that. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, the options are around 20 GeV, which is the E I computed earlier. So the total energy is about 20 GeV.

But none of the options are 20 GeV. The closest is option C (20.132 GeV), but my calculation is 20.005 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculations. Let me recalculate using more precise numbers.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01347601 u.

Each u is exactly 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01347601 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

m=6.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute that.

6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 =approx 0.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27.

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27=1.6605390666e-29.

0.00347601 *1.6605390666e-27=approx 5.775e-30 (exact calculation needed).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 6.01347601 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

But perhaps it's easier to compute m c² in joules and then convert to GeV.

c is 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So E = gamma * m c².

But perhaps it's easier to compute m c² in GeV.

m =6.01347601 u.

1 u = 0.931494 GeV/c².

So m c²=6.01347601 *0.931494 GeV.

As computed earlier, that's approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Hmm, so when I compute gamma * m c², I get 3.57142857 *5.6015 ≈20.005 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is 20.132 GeV, but my calculation is a bit off due to approximations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma factor more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v^2/c^2 =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, no issue there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60151882 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60151882.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60151882.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.00151882.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.001 =0.00357142857.

3.57142857 *0.00051882≈0.00185714285.

So 3.57142857 *0.00151882≈0.00357142857 +0.00185714285≈0.00542857142.

So 3.57142857 *0.60151882≈2.14285714 +0.00542857142≈2.14828571.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.14828571=20.00542856 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0054 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the nucleus can be found using the formula:

mass_defect = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - M_nucleus.

But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact binding energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the fact that the mass of the nucleus is (Z + N) * average_nucleon_mass - binding_energy/c².

But perhaps that's too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact binding energy of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption that the nucleus is Li-6. Wait, the problem says "Li with 3 neutrons." So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons: Li-6. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can use the exact value of the mass from a precise table.

According to the table, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013476 amu.

Wait, so m c² is 6.013476 * 0.931494 GeV =5.60151872 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60151872=20.005422 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places, but the options are given to four. So 20.0054 GeV is approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.013476 u but higher.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass of Li-6.

Looking it up, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512275 u. So the nucleus's mass is 6.01512275 u minus 3 *0.0005485799 u.

So 6.01512275 -0.0016457397 =6.01347601 u.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Since v=0.96c, beta=0.96 exactly.

So beta=0.96, beta squared is 0.9216, 1-beta squared is 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Thus, gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

Hmm, that's exact.

So gamma is 3.5714285714285714.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.5714285714285714 *5.60151872.

Which is approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton and neutron, not the nucleus. No, the problem is about the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single Li nucleus, but perhaps it's considering the charge state, like Li+ or something. For example, if the nucleus has lost an electron, but I don't think that affects the mass much.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

If E=20.005 GeV is the total energy, then the kinetic energy is E - m c²=20.005 -5.6015=14.4035 GeV.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the nucleus's mass. Maybe I should use the exact binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact mass of the nucleus using the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should not subtract the electrons' mass because the rest mass of the nucleus is calculated from the atomic mass. Hmm, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons, so the nucleus's mass is atomic mass minus electrons.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should not subtract the electrons, but instead, the nucleus's mass is the same as the atomic mass. But that can't be right because the nucleus doesn't have the electrons bound to it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass directly, considering that the electrons are part of the atom, but not the nucleus. So the nucleus's rest mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.127 GeV higher than my calculation of 20.005 GeV. That's about a 0.6% difference.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is slightly higher due to more precise calculations, or perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the conversion from u to GeV/c². Let me check that.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² =0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013476 u =6.013476 *0.931494 GeV/c².

Compute this accurately.

6 *0.931494=5.588964 GeV.

0.013476 *0.931494.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.003476 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.000476 *0.931494=approx 0.0004454.

So 0.003476 *0.931494≈0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

Total for 0.013476 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822 GeV.

So total m c²=5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60151882=20.005422 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing where the error is.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-7, which has 4 neutrons. Wait, the question says 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a Li-7 nucleus, but that would be 7 u minus electrons, but that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the energy using the rest mass in kilograms.

Let me try that.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.013476 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m=6.013476 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

m=6 *1.6605390666e-27=9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.013476 *1.6605390666e-27=0.013476 *1.6605390666e-27≈2.237e-29 kg.

So m ≈9.9632343996e-27 +2.237e-29 ≈9.9856e-27 kg.

Now, c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

E=gamma * m c².

Gamma=3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *9.9856e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Compute c²: (2.99792458e8)^2≈8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So E=3.5714285714 *9.9856e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Compute 9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 =9.9856 *8.987551787e-10 ≈90.826e-10 =9.0826e-9 J.

Now, E=3.5714285714 *9.0826e-9 J ≈3.5714285714 *9.0826e-9 ≈32.45e-9 J.

Convert Joules to GeV: 1 eV =1.60218e-19 J.

So 1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.

So E=32.45e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈32.45e-9 /1.60218e-10 ≈202 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way off. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 9.9856e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, (2.99792458e8)^2 =8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So 9.9856e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s² =9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.9856 *8.987551787) *1e-27+16 = (approx 90.826) *1e-11 =9.0826e-10 J.

Now, multiply by gamma: 3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10 J=32.45e-10 J=3.245e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV: 3.245e-9 J / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) =approx 20.25 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.25 GeV.

Wait, that's closer to option C:20.132 GeV, but still not matching exactly.

Hmm, perhaps my approximation is leading to this. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, computing 9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16.

9.9856e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.9856 *8.987551787) *1e-27 +16 = (approx 90.826) *1e-11=9.0826e-10 J.

Then, 3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10 =3.5714285714 *9.0826e-10.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *9.0826.

3 *9.0826=27.2478.

0.5714285714 *9.0826.

0.5 *9.0826=4.5413.

0.0714285714 *9.0826≈0.6483.

So total for 0.5714285714 part is 4.5413 +0.6483=5.1896.

So total is 27.2478 +5.1896=32.4374.

So E=32.4374e-10 J =3.24374e-9 J.

Convert to GeV:3.24374e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV =3.24374e-9 /1.60218e-10 ≈20.25 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.25 GeV. Closer to option C (20.132), but still not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation leads to 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 23.069 GeV, but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me compute the mass again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of each proton is approximately 1.007276 u.

Each neutron is approximately 1.008665 u.

So total mass of nucleons:3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013476 u.

The mass defect is 6.047823 -6.013476 =0.034347 u.

Which corresponds to binding energy: 0.034347 u *931.494 MeV/u ≈32.09 MeV.

But perhaps this approach is not helpful for the current calculation.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the energy should be around 20 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Perhaps I missed some decimal points in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation of gamma is:

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So with gamma accurately known, perhaps the precise calculation would yield 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m c² with more precise values.

m c²=5.60151882 GeV.

gamma=3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.60151882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 *0.00151882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.001=0.0035714285714.

3.5714285714 *0.00051882.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.0005=0.0017857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.00001882≈approx 0.000067304.

So 3.5714285714 *0.00051882≈0.0017857142857 +0.000067304≈0.001853018.

So 3.5714285714 *0.00151882≈0.0035714285714 +0.001853018≈0.005424446.

So 3.5714285714 *0.60151882≈2.14285714284 +0.005424446≈2.148281589.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.148281589≈20.00542445 GeV.

Hmm, that's still about 20.0054 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I should use the rest mass of the individual nucleons, not the nucleus.

But that approach would give a much higher energy, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with the mass of the proton plus neutron, but that doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, due to a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m c² with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is 6.013476 u, which is 6.013476 *0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.013476 *0.931494.

Let me compute this precisely.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.013476 *0.931494.

Break it down:

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.003476 *0.931494.

0.003 *0.931494=0.002794482.

0.000476 *0.931494=0.0004454.

So 0.003476 *0.931494=0.002794482 +0.0004454=0.003239882.

So total for 0.013476 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.003239882=0.012554822.

So m c²=5.588964 +0.012554822=5.60151882 GeV.

Now, E=3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Let me compute this with high precision.

Calculate 3.5714285714 *5.60151882.

Break it into 3.5 *5.60151882 + 0.0714285714 *5.60151882.

3.5 *5.60151882 = 19.60531587.

0.0714285714 *5.60151882.

Compute 0.07 *5.60151882 = 0.3921063174.

0.0014285714 *5.60151882 ≈0.0079999999.

So total for 0.0714285714 part is 0.3921063174 +0.0079999999 ≈0.4001063173.

So E=19.60531587 +0.4001063173 =20.005422187 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure where the discrepancy comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, and the energy is given per nucleon. No, the problem states the nucleus's speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma m_p c², where m_p is the proton mass, but that doesn't make sense for a nucleus.

Hmm, I'm not seeing where the error is. Based on my calculations, the energy is approximately 20.005 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but that doesn't align with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but perhaps I should be using beta =v/c=0.96, which I did.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV. Maybe I made a minor miscalculation earlier that's leading to a slight discrepancy.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a moving object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01512275 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The mass of 3 electrons is subtracted to find the nucleus's mass:

\[
\text{Mass of 3 electrons} = 3 \times 0.0005485799 \, \text{u} = 0.0016457397 \, \text{u}
\]

\[
\text{Mass of Li-6 nucleus} = 6.01512275 \, \text{u} - 0.0016457397 \, \text{u} = 6.01347601 \, \text{u}
\]

Convert this to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01347601 \times 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \approx 5.6015 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6015 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.005 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.005 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

The closest match to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, likely due to rounding or slight approximations in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C
