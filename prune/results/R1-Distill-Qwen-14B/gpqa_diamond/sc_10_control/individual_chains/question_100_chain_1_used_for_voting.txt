Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first glance. Let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I know that the molecular formula C3H6 could correspond to either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, that's usually indicative of addition across a double bond, so I'm leaning towards propene as Compound A.

So, Compound A (probably propene) undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. For propene, adding bromine would result in 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, wait, adding bromine in CCl4 would probably be an addition reaction, so 1,2-dibromopropane as compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good condition for elimination reactions. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH would likely lead to elimination of HBr, forming an alkene. The reaction would produce propene again. Wait, but wait, no—wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms next to each other. When you eliminate HBr from each Br, you would form a double bond. So perhaps the product is propene? But wait, wouldn't that be the same as the starting material? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different alkene. Let me think: 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, would eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming an alkene. The possible alkenes from 1,2-dibromopropane would be 1-propene or 2-propene (propene again). Wait, but if you have CH2Br-CH2-Br, and you eliminate HBr from each, you would form CH2=CH2, which is ethylene. Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So in the case of 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2Br, when you eliminate twice, you get CH2=CH2? But that's ethylene, an alkene with two carbons. But wait, the starting material was propene (three carbons), so upon adding Br2, it becomes 1,2-dibromopropane. Then elimination would result in either 1-propene or another isomer? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound isn't propene. Let's think again: C3H6 could be cyclopropane as well. If A is cyclopropane, then bromination in CCl4 would be different. Wait, no, cyclopropane is a three-membered ring with all single bonds. Bromination of cyclopropane in CCl4 would probably be an addition reaction, maybe opening the ring. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Compound A is propene. So, A is CH2=CHCH3. Bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, propene has three carbons. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, but that's only three carbons. So when Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, and in such conditions, elimination reactions (like E2) occur. So the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, it could deprotonate a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. So the product would be propene again, but wait—no, because the starting material was propene, and after bromination and elimination, we get the same thing? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a different structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. When KOH removes H from, say, C3, but wait, the Br is on C1 and C2. Alternatively, maybe the elimination would form 1-propene or something else. Wait, actually, when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane), elimination with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would form an alkene. So in this case, the product would be propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. But wait, that suggests that after the bromination and elimination, we end up with the same molecule as the starting material. So compound C is propene again? Or is there another possibility?

Wait, another thought: maybe when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it produces an alkene, but perhaps a different one. But given that B is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form either 1-propene or perhaps a different isomer. But wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3; I don't think there's another possible alkene from this structure. So perhaps compound C is propene.

Moving on. Compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube to produce compound D. Red-hot iron usually indicates catalytic hydrogenation. So if C is propene, adding H2 in the presence of a catalyst like Fe would add hydrogen across the double bond, giving propane. So D is propane, which is C3H8.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, two strong acids—maybe concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, but that's more for nitrations. Alternatively, perhaps a mixture like H2SO4 and HNO3, but that's more for making nitration conditions. Or perhaps it's HCl and HNO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylation? Wait, another thought: could this be a sulfonation reaction? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, propane is C3H8. When it's treated with strong acids, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. But I'm not recalling exactly. Wait, maybe this is a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation, but I don't see how.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is with two strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3, which could be a nitration reaction. But for that, you would typically have a nitronium ion (from HNO3 and H2SO4). But propane is an alkane, which doesn't have a double bond, so nitration would be difficult. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation, but again, alkanes are unreactive towards such reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the two strong acids refer to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, another possibility—maybe the reaction is with a mixture of H2SO4 and HCl, leading to the formation of a chloro compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture is HCl and another acid, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the next steps. If E is formed, and then E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Iron scrap and HCl—maybe a reaction involving Fe and Cl- leading to some FeCl3, but I'm not sure how that relates. Alternatively, E could be a chloro compound.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible reactions for D. D is propane, which has the formula C3H8. If D is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, perhaps it's a dihalogenation. For example, HCl and another acid like HBr, but that's not likely. Or perhaps it's H2SO4 and HNO3, but that's more about nitrating.

Wait, perhaps the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the reaction is a chlorination. But alkanes are typically unreactive towards such conditions unless under high temperature. Maybe if it's a radical chlorination, but that requires light, not just the acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else. Let's think further: after D is propane, the next reaction is with two strong acids to form E. Then E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F.

Wait, another angle: If D is propane, and when treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but that's usually for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration, but that's for alkenes. Wait, no.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here and need to proceed further. Let me see what comes next. Compound E is treated with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Iron and HCl—maybe it's a reaction where Fe reacts with HCl to produce H2 gas, but I'm not sure how that relates to E.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a chloroalkane. For example, if D (propane) is treated with HCl under certain conditions, maybe it forms chloropropane. But I thought alkanes require high temperatures and catalysts for such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps E is a chloro compound, and then F is formed by some reaction involving Fe.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two strong acids are HCl and HBr. Then, D (propane) reacts with HCl and HBr to form a dihalide, perhaps. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to outline all the steps again:

A (C3H6) → B (bromination in CCl4)
B → C (alcoholic KOH)
C → D (red-hot Fe)
D → E (two strong acids)
E → F (Fe scrap, HCl)
F → G (nitrous acid)
G → H (NaOH)

Let me think about each step again.

1. A is C3H6. Could be propene (CH2=CHCH3) or cyclopropane (C3H6).

2. Bromination in CCl4: likely an addition reaction. If A is propene, then B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, the structure would depend on where the Br adds. Wait, propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

3. B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, reaction with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would lead to elimination of two molecules of HBr, forming an alkene. So C would be propene again. So C is CH2=CHCH3.

4. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So hydrogen gas is added across the double bond, converting the alkene to an alkane. So D is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

5. D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about reactions of propane with strong acids. One possibility is that it's a sulfonation, but alkanes don't typically react under such conditions. Another possibility is that it's a chlorination, but that's usually done under high temperature with Cl2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, and E is a chloroalkane, like chloropropane. But how? Maybe through a substitution reaction.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, leading to the formation of a nitronium ion, which could nitrate the compound. But propane is an alkane, and it's not activated for nitration. So that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe D (propane) is being oxidized. But propane is a saturated alkane, and oxidation usually requires a double bond. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and another acid, and under certain conditions, like in the presence of light, a halogenation occurs. But without light, alkanes are generally unreactive towards halogens. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free radical substitution, but that needs initiation, like light or heat.

Hmm. Let me think: maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and the reaction is a sulfonation. But again, alkanes don't react that way. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe D is being converted into something else. Let me think: D is propane. Reacting with two strong acids—could that lead to the formation of a carbocation? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but that usually requires an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is propane, and the two strong acids are HCl and another acid, leading to the formation of a chloroalkane via a substitution. But that's not straightforward without a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the mixture of two strong acids is something else, like HCl and H2SO4, which are used in certain substitution reactions. But I'm not recalling the exact process.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are nitric and sulfuric, which could be for nitrating, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward and see if any of the options give a clue. Let's look at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. That suggests that F is a compound like aniline or something with an amino group, which is often used in dyes.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Iron(III) chloride is used as a test for phenols. Phenols give a red-brown color when treated with FeCl3. So H might be a phenol.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propane, which is CH3CH2CH3. Its NMR would show a singlet for the nine equivalent H atoms. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. So if D is propane, C is incorrect because NMR would show a single singlet, not two. So perhaps option C is the incorrect statement. But wait, the question is about which statement is incorrect, so if option C claims D gives two singlets, but D is propane with a single singlet, then option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

So if the options are about the correctness of the statements, and if option C is incorrect because D (propane) has a single NMR peak, not two, then option C is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me go back to the reactions to confirm. Because I'm not entirely sure about all the steps, especially E and F.

Wait, let's think about each compound:

A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (but wait, that's three carbons; the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, that's three carbons, so the Brs are on C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Then B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH: elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules, to form either 1-propene or another alkene. But since the starting material was propene, elimination would produce the same molecule, so C is propene again.

C → D: passing through red-hot Fe. So D is propane.

D → E: when propane is treated with two strong acids. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the reaction is a chlorination. But without a catalyst or light, alkanes don't react. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but that's not typical for alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the two acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but I can't see how that would react with propane. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but that requires an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps D (propane) is being converted into a different compound. Wait, another possibility: maybe the two strong acids are HCl and HNO3, and the reaction is a substitution leading to a chlorinated propane. But without a catalyst, I don't think that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what comes next. E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. If E is chloropropane, then F could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D (propane) reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form something else. Wait, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but as I said earlier, that's not typical for alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but again, alkanes don't react that way.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another reaction. Let me think: what if D is propane and the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, leading to the formation of chloropropane through a substitution. But without a catalyst, this is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a free radical chlorination, but that requires initiation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about the next step. E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. If E is chloropropane, then reacting with Fe and HCl could lead to a substitution reaction. Wait, Fe in HCl is a reducing environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, maybe E is chloropropane, and in the presence of Fe and HCl, it undergoes some reaction. For example, if E is CCl3CH2Cl, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again. The question is about which statement is incorrect. If I can determine what each compound is, I can check the options.

Looking at option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propane, which is CH3CH2CH3. In NMR, all the H's are equivalent, so it's a single peak. So option C claiming two singlets is incorrect. So option C is an incorrect statement. Therefore, the answer is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure about all the steps to see if I made a mistake.

So to recap:

A: propene (C3H6).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

C: propene (after elimination of HBr twice).

D: propane (after catalytic hydrogenation).

E: ? (D treated with two strong acids).

F: ? (E treated with Fe and HCl).

But regardless, D is propane, so the NMR of D has a single singlet. So option C's statement is incorrect.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), which is identified as propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) as Compound B. When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, removing two molecules of HBr and regenerating propene (CH2=CHCH3) as Compound C. 

Compound C (propene) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube, which catalyzes the addition of hydrogen across the double bond, forming propane (CH3CH2CH3) as Compound D. Propane is a saturated alkane and does not react under typical conditions, so the claim that Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form Compound E is unclear. However, for the purpose of analyzing the options, the focus shifts to the NMR properties of Compound D.

Compound D (propane) has the molecular formula CH3CH2CH3. In its 1H NMR spectrum, all nine hydrogens are equivalent, resulting in a single singlet. Therefore, the statement that Compound D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. This is plausible if F is a compound like aniline, which is often used in dye synthesis.
- **B)** H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This is consistent with H being a phenol, which reacts with FeCl3 to produce a red-brown precipitate.
- **C)** D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. This is incorrect because D (propane) has a single singlet in its NMR spectrum.
- **D)** C is a flammable gas. This is correct because C (propene) is a flammable gas.

The incorrect statement is **C**, as Compound D (propane) does not give two singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first glance. Let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I know that the molecular formula C3H6 could correspond to either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, that's usually indicative of addition across a double bond, so I'm leaning towards propene as Compound A.

So, Compound A (probably propene) undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. For propene, adding bromine would result in 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, wait, adding bromine in CCl4 would probably be an addition reaction, so 1,2-dibromopropane as compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good condition for elimination reactions. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH would likely lead to elimination of HBr, forming an alkene. The reaction would produce propene again. Wait, but wait, no—wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms next to each other. When you eliminate HBr from each Br, you would form a double bond. So perhaps the product is propene? But wait, wouldn't that be the same as the starting material? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different alkene. Let me think: 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, would eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming an alkene. The possible alkenes from 1,2-dibromopropane would be 1-propene or 2-propene (propene again). Wait, but if you have CH2Br-CH2-Br, and you eliminate HBr from each, you would form CH2=CH2, which is ethylene. Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So in the case of 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2Br, when you eliminate twice, you get CH2=CH2? But that's ethylene, an alkene with two carbons. But wait, the starting material was propene (three carbons), so upon adding Br2, it becomes 1,2-dibromopropane. Then elimination would result in either 1-propene or another isomer? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound isn't propene. Let's think again: C3H6 could be cyclopropane as well. If A is cyclopropane, then bromination in CCl4 would be different. Wait, no, cyclopropane is a three-membered ring with all single bonds. Bromination of cyclopropane in CCl4 would probably be an addition reaction, maybe opening the ring. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Compound A is propene. So, A is CH2=CHCH3. Bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, propene has three carbons. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, but that's only three carbons. So when Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, and in such conditions, elimination reactions (like E2) occur. So the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, it could deprotonate a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. So the product would be propene again, but wait—no, because the starting material was propene, and after bromination and elimination, we get the same thing? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a different structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. When KOH removes H from, say, C3, but wait, the Br is on C1 and C2. Alternatively, maybe the elimination would form 1-propene or something else. Wait, actually, when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane), elimination with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would form an alkene. So in this case, the product would be propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. But wait, that suggests that after the bromination and elimination, we end up with the same molecule as the starting material. So compound C is propene again? Or is there another possibility?

Wait, another thought: maybe when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it produces an alkene, but perhaps a different one. But given that B is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form either 1-propene or perhaps a different isomer. But wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3; I don't think there's another possible alkene from this structure. So perhaps compound C is propene.

Moving on. Compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube to produce compound D. Red-hot iron usually indicates catalytic hydrogenation. So if C is propene, adding H2 in the presence of a catalyst like Fe would add hydrogen across the double bond, giving propane. So D is propane, which is C3H8.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, two strong acids—maybe concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, but that's more for nitrations. Alternatively, perhaps a mixture like H2SO4 and HNO3, but that's more for making nitration conditions. Or perhaps it's HCl and HNO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylation? Wait, another thought: could this be a sulfonation reaction? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, propane is C3H8. When it's treated with strong acids, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. But I'm not recalling exactly. Wait, maybe this is a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation, but I don't see how.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is with two strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3, which could be a nitration reaction. But for that, you would typically have a nitronium ion (from HNO3 and H2SO4). But propane is an alkane, which doesn't have a double bond, so nitration would be difficult. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation, but again, alkanes are unreactive towards such reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the two strong acids refer to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, another possibility—maybe the reaction is with a mixture of H2SO4 and HCl, leading to the formation of a chloro compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture is HCl and another acid, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the next steps. If E is formed, and then E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Iron scrap and HCl—maybe a reaction involving Fe and Cl- leading to some FeCl3, but I'm not sure how that relates. Alternatively, E could be a chloro compound.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible reactions for D. D is propane, which has the formula C3H8. If D is treated with a mixture of two strong acids, perhaps it's a dihalogenation. For example, HCl and another acid like HBr, but that's not likely. Or perhaps it's H2SO4 and HNO3, but that's more about nitrating.

Wait, perhaps the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the reaction is a chlorination. But alkanes are typically unreactive towards such conditions unless under high temperature. Maybe if it's a radical chlorination, but that requires light, not just the acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else. Let's think further: after D is propane, the next reaction is with two strong acids to form E. Then E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F.

Wait, another angle: If D is propane, and when treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but that's usually for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration, but that's for alkenes. Wait, no.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here and need to proceed further. Let me see what comes next. Compound E is treated with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Iron and HCl—maybe it's a reaction where Fe reacts with HCl to produce H2 gas, but I'm not sure how that relates to E.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a chloroalkane. For example, if D (propane) is treated with HCl under certain conditions, maybe it forms chloropropane. But I thought alkanes require high temperatures and catalysts for such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps E is a chloro compound, and then F is formed by some reaction involving Fe.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two strong acids are HCl and HBr. Then, D (propane) reacts with HCl and HBr to form a dihalide, perhaps. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to outline all the steps again:

A (C3H6) → B (bromination in CCl4)
B → C (alcoholic KOH)
C → D (red-hot Fe)
D → E (two strong acids)
E → F (Fe scrap, HCl)
F → G (nitrous acid)
G → H (NaOH)

Let me think about each step again.

1. A is C3H6. Could be propene (CH2=CHCH3) or cyclopropane (C3H6).

2. Bromination in CCl4: likely an addition reaction. If A is propene, then B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, the structure would depend on where the Br adds. Wait, propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

3. B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, reaction with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would lead to elimination of two molecules of HBr, forming an alkene. So C would be propene again. So C is CH2=CHCH3.

4. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So hydrogen gas is added across the double bond, converting the alkene to an alkane. So D is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

5. D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about reactions of propane with strong acids. One possibility is that it's a sulfonation, but alkanes don't typically react under such conditions. Another possibility is that it's a chlorination, but that's usually done under high temperature with Cl2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, and E is a chloroalkane, like chloropropane. But how? Maybe through a substitution reaction.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, leading to the formation of a nitronium ion, which could nitrate the compound. But propane is an alkane, and it's not activated for nitration. So that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe D (propane) is being oxidized. But propane is a saturated alkane, and oxidation usually requires a double bond. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and another acid, and under certain conditions, like in the presence of light, a halogenation occurs. But without light, alkanes are generally unreactive towards halogens. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free radical substitution, but that needs initiation, like light or heat.

Hmm. Let me think: maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and the reaction is a sulfonation. But again, alkanes don't react that way. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe D is being converted into something else. Let me think: D is propane. Reacting with two strong acids—could that lead to the formation of a carbocation? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but that usually requires an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is propane, and the two strong acids are HCl and another acid, leading to the formation of a chloroalkane via a substitution. But that's not straightforward without a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the mixture of two strong acids is something else, like HCl and H2SO4, which are used in certain substitution reactions. But I'm not recalling the exact process.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are nitric and sulfuric, which could be for nitrating, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward and see if any of the options give a clue. Let's look at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. That suggests that F is a compound like aniline or something with an amino group, which is often used in dyes.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Iron(III) chloride is used as a test for phenols. Phenols give a red-brown color when treated with FeCl3. So H might be a phenol.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propane, which is CH3CH2CH3. Its NMR would show a singlet for the nine equivalent H atoms. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. So if D is propane, C is incorrect because NMR would show a single singlet, not two. So perhaps option C is the incorrect statement. But wait, the question is about which statement is incorrect, so if option C claims D gives two singlets, but D is propane with a single singlet, then option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

So if the options are about the correctness of the statements, and if option C is incorrect because D (propane) has a single NMR peak, not two, then option C is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me go back to the reactions to confirm. Because I'm not entirely sure about all the steps, especially E and F.

Wait, let's think about each compound:

A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (but wait, that's three carbons; the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, that's three carbons, so the Brs are on C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Then B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH: elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules, to form either 1-propene or another alkene. But since the starting material was propene, elimination would produce the same molecule, so C is propene again.

C → D: passing through red-hot Fe. So D is propane.

D → E: when propane is treated with two strong acids. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the reaction is a chlorination. But without a catalyst or light, alkanes don't react. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but that's not typical for alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the two acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but I can't see how that would react with propane. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but that requires an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps D (propane) is being converted into a different compound. Wait, another possibility: maybe the two strong acids are HCl and HNO3, and the reaction is a substitution leading to a chlorinated propane. But without a catalyst, I don't think that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what comes next. E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. If E is chloropropane, then F could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D (propane) reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form something else. Wait, perhaps it's a sulfonation, but as I said earlier, that's not typical for alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but again, alkanes don't react that way.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another reaction. Let me think: what if D is propane and the two acids are HCl and H2SO4, leading to the formation of chloropropane through a substitution. But without a catalyst, this is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a free radical chlorination, but that requires initiation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about the next step. E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. If E is chloropropane, then reacting with Fe and HCl could lead to a substitution reaction. Wait, Fe in HCl is a reducing environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, maybe E is chloropropane, and in the presence of Fe and HCl, it undergoes some reaction. For example, if E is CCl3CH2Cl, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again. The question is about which statement is incorrect. If I can determine what each compound is, I can check the options.

Looking at option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propane, which is CH3CH2CH3. In NMR, all the H's are equivalent, so it's a single peak. So option C claiming two singlets is incorrect. So option C is an incorrect statement. Therefore, the answer is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure about all the steps to see if I made a mistake.

So to recap:

A: propene (C3H6).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

C: propene (after elimination of HBr twice).

D: propane (after catalytic hydrogenation).

E: ? (D treated with two strong acids).

F: ? (E treated with Fe and HCl).

But regardless, D is propane, so the NMR of D has a single singlet. So option C's statement is incorrect.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), which is identified as propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) as Compound B. When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, removing two molecules of HBr and regenerating propene (CH2=CHCH3) as Compound C. 

Compound C (propene) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube, which catalyzes the addition of hydrogen across the double bond, forming propane (CH3CH2CH3) as Compound D. Propane is a saturated alkane and does not react under typical conditions, so the claim that Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form Compound E is unclear. However, for the purpose of analyzing the options, the focus shifts to the NMR properties of Compound D.

Compound D (propane) has the molecular formula CH3CH2CH3. In its 1H NMR spectrum, all nine hydrogens are equivalent, resulting in a single singlet. Therefore, the statement that Compound D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. This is plausible if F is a compound like aniline, which is often used in dye synthesis.
- **B)** H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This is consistent with H being a phenol, which reacts with FeCl3 to produce a red-brown precipitate.
- **C)** D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. This is incorrect because D (propane) has a single singlet in its NMR spectrum.
- **D)** C is a flammable gas. This is correct because C (propene) is a flammable gas.

The incorrect statement is **C**, as Compound D (propane) does not give two singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum. 

Answer: C
