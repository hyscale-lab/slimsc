Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that luminosity for stars is related to radius and temperature, not mass directly, I think. Unless we're using some other formula that ties in mass, but I'm not sure.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, which depends on their temperature. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because as λ increases, temperature decreases. So T1 = T2. Wait, but wait, no—Wien's Law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature?

Wait, but I thought stars with higher mass might have different temperatures. Oh, but in this case, the problem says they have the same peak wavelength, so T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So since both have the same T, the luminosity depends on R squared.

Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 = T2, so (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make the luminosity of Star_1 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is about 2.25, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait. There's more to the problem. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, right, but how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, right? So whether a star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity) affects its observed brightness through Doppler shift, but not its intrinsic luminosity. Or does it?

Wait, no, because the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so if a star is moving, it's the apparent brightness that changes, not the luminosity. Oh, but wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. So maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are the same (given), perhaps that's already accounted for.

Wait, but the problem says they found the same wavelengths as the points where the stars appeared brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength would be Doppler-shifted. Oh, right, so the star's actual temperature would be different, but because of the Doppler effect, their observed λ_max would be the same. Hmm, but the problem says the λ_max are the same, so maybe they corrected for the Doppler shift? But that might complicate things.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... so perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but when you compute luminosity, you have to consider the Doppler effect?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

The observed flux F is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but adjusted for the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelengths are shifted. The Doppler shift affects the observed flux because the observed wavelength determines the observed photon energy. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact effect here.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect, but when you calculate the luminosity, you have to correct for that. Hmm.

Wait, let me think in terms of flux. The flux F is the energy per unit area per unit time received from the star. The flux is related to the star's luminosity and distance. But in this problem, maybe the distance isn't a factor because they're talking about the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars were observed to have the same peak wavelengths. So, without considering Doppler shift, their temperatures would be same, hence same T. But if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. So the observed λ_max would be shorter. But the problem says the observed λ_max are the same, meaning that the Doppler shift must have been accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame of the stars. So when calculating luminosity, we have to take into account the Doppler shift. Because when a star moves, the observed flux changes. So I think the formula for flux considering Doppler shift would be F = (L / (4πd²)) * (1 + v_r / c)², but I'm not entirely sure. I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the observed temperature. Because the star's actual temperature is T, but due to Doppler shift, the observed temperature might be T_observed = T * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But if the observed λ_max is the same, then perhaps the Doppler effect has been factored in.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's break down what each part contributes.

First, let's compute the intrinsic luminosity. Luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4. For Star_2, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

If the stars have the same observed λ_max, which is λ_max = b / T_obs, but considering Doppler shift, the actual temperature of Star_2 might be different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same, which is due to the Doppler effect.

So, for Star_1, it's at rest, so its observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is positive if moving away. Wait, but if it's moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer, so λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). Since λ_max is the same as Star_1, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So:

λ1 = b / T1.

λ2_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

But λ1 = λ2_obs:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Simplify, cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is >1, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c), which would make T2 > T1? But wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying lower temperature. So if the observed λ_max is same as Star_1 (λ1), and Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature is lower than T1.

Wait, perhaps I have the Doppler shift formula wrong. Let me think again. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer. So for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength.

But the problem says the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So:

λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

But λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = λ1_rest.

So:

b / T2 * (1 + v2/c) = b / T1.

Cancel b:

(1 + v2/c) / T2 = 1 / T1.

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). 

Wait, but if v2 is positive (moving away), then T2 would be higher than T1. But that can't be, because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, implying lower temperature. So I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away. So for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c). But since λ2_obs equals λ1_rest, which is λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, putting it together:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then T2 is higher than T1. That doesn't make sense because moving away would make the observed wavelength longer, implying lower temperature. Hmm, maybe I have the formula backwards. Could it be λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (c + v_observer) / (c + v_source) ) )? Wait, that's when the source is moving away. Oh, right, the relativistic Doppler shift is more accurately given by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ) when the source is moving away. No, wait, that's for transverse Doppler effect, maybe. Or perhaps I should consider the non-relativistic approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if the source is moving away.

So in that case, if Star_2 is moving away, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

But since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, and λ_rest_1 = b / T1, λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So:

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

Which gives:

1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is higher than T1 because v2 is positive (moving away). But that contradicts the expectation because if a star is moving away, its observed temperature would appear lower, right? Because the wavelength would be longer, implying lower temperature.

Ah, I think I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me correct.

If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted (rest) wavelength. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity away (positive). So, when you observe a star moving away, the wavelength is longer, which means the temperature appears lower.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So:

λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

But λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (since Star_1 isn't moving, v=0).

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

So:

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest is related to temperature as λ_rest = b / T.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), that would make T2 higher than T1. But that doesn't make sense because if a star is moving away, it's observed as cooler, meaning T_obs is lower. But according to the formula, T_rest is higher. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, so we have to adjust the calculated T.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because the observed wavelength is the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different. So when calculating luminosity, which depends on the actual (intrinsic) temperature, we need to correct for the Doppler effect.

So, the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual temperatures of the two stars are different because of their velocities.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the luminosity they compute is based on the observed flux, which accounts for Doppler shift.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses the intrinsic temperature, not the observed. So if the observed wavelength is affected by Doppler shift, the intrinsic temperature would be different.

Wait, so for Star_1, it's at rest, so observed λ_max is the same as intrinsic λ_max. So T1 = b / λ_max_1.

For Star_2, observed λ_max is same, but it's moving away. So:

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_max_1.

So,

λ_rest_2 = λ_max_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = λ_max_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_max_1 = b / T1. So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c).

Simplify:

1/T2 = (1/(T1)) / (1 + v2/c).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is greater than T1.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, that's counterintuitive because if Star_2 is moving away, shouldn't it appear cooler, not hotter? Oh, but when you calculate the intrinsic temperature, because the observed wavelength is longer, the actual (intrinsic) temperature is higher.

Wait, wait, let me think again.

If a star is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than the intrinsic λ_max. Because the light is redshifted.

So, intrinsic λ_max (λ_rest) is shorter than observed λ_max (λ_obs). Because for a star moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, λ_obs is longer than λ_rest. But in this problem, λ_obs for both stars is the same.

So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_rest_1.

Because Star_1's λ_obs is the same as Star_2's, and Star_1 is at rest, so λ_rest_1 = λ_obs_1.

So,

λ_rest_2 = λ_obs_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

λ_rest_1 = b / T1.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v2/c)).

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is higher than T1. So, now when we compute the luminosities, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4, L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

But R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

And T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). But v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v2/c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

v2 = 700 km/s.

So,

v2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So,

T2/T1 ≈ 1.0023333.

So, (T2/T1)^4 ≈ (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute that. 1.0023333^4.

Approximate using binomial expansion:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... for small x.

x=0.002333.

n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * 0.000005444 ≈ 0.00003266.

Fourth term: 4 * 3 * 2/(6) * (0.002333)^3 = (4*3*2)/(6) x^3 = 4 x^3 → 4*(0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.0000000128 ≈ 0.0000000512.

Which is negligible.

So total is approximately 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003266 ≈ 1.00936466.

So (T2/T1)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, because L is proportional to R² T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We have R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1/T2 = 1/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Again, using binomial approx for (1 - x)^4 where x=0.00233:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x³ + x^4.

x=0.00233.

So,

1 -4*(0.00233) = 1 -0.00932 = 0.99068.

+6*(0.00233)^2 = 6*(0.00000543) ≈ 0.0000326.

-4*(0.00233)^3 ≈ -4*(0.0000000128) ≈ -0.000000051.

+ x^4 ≈ negligible.

So,

≈ 0.99068 + 0.0000326 = 0.9907126.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2268.

Which is approximately 2.23. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the factor is about 2.23, so the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would be 2.25, but considering the Doppler shift, it's a bit less because T2 is higher, making L2 higher than it would be without the Doppler effect. Wait, wait, wait, no. Because T2 is higher than T1, the luminosity would be higher for Star_2. But the question is what's the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, no, the problem says L1 is greater than L2 by a factor. So, let me double-check.

Wait, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → T2 is larger.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4 → 4π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4 → 4π R2² σ T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = [2.25 R2² T1^4 ] / [ R2² T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 ] ].

Simplify:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4.

Wait, wait a second. I think I had a mistake earlier.

Because when I had L1 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4.

But T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v2/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.002333))^4 ≈ 2.25 * (approx 0.9907) → 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2268, which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought of it as 2.25 without considering the Doppler effect. So the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D.

So the initial assumption that the temperatures are the same was wrong because of the Doppler shift. So I have to account for that.

So the answer is D) ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - The radial velocities are \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_1 and \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_2.
   - The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) of both stars are the same, implying that the Doppler effect must be accounted for when calculating intrinsic temperatures.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is therefore:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]

3. **Temperature Adjustment for Doppler Shift**:
   The observed peak wavelength is related to the intrinsic temperature by Wien's law:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is the same for both stars, the intrinsic temperatures must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}}{1 + v/c}
   \]
   For Star_2, moving away with velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the intrinsic temperature is:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**:
   The ratio of temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
   \]
   Raising this to the fourth power:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]
   With \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \), we calculate:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]
   Combining this with \( \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2268
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately \( 2.23 \).

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that luminosity for stars is related to radius and temperature, not mass directly, I think. Unless we're using some other formula that ties in mass, but I'm not sure.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, which depends on their temperature. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because as λ increases, temperature decreases. So T1 = T2. Wait, but wait, no—Wien's Law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature?

Wait, but I thought stars with higher mass might have different temperatures. Oh, but in this case, the problem says they have the same peak wavelength, so T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So since both have the same T, the luminosity depends on R squared.

Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 = T2, so (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make the luminosity of Star_1 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is about 2.25, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait. There's more to the problem. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, right, but how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, right? So whether a star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity) affects its observed brightness through Doppler shift, but not its intrinsic luminosity. Or does it?

Wait, no, because the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so if a star is moving, it's the apparent brightness that changes, not the luminosity. Oh, but wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. So maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are the same (given), perhaps that's already accounted for.

Wait, but the problem says they found the same wavelengths as the points where the stars appeared brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength would be Doppler-shifted. Oh, right, so the star's actual temperature would be different, but because of the Doppler effect, their observed λ_max would be the same. Hmm, but the problem says the λ_max are the same, so maybe they corrected for the Doppler shift? But that might complicate things.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... so perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but when you compute luminosity, you have to consider the Doppler effect?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

The observed flux F is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but adjusted for the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelengths are shifted. The Doppler shift affects the observed flux because the observed wavelength determines the observed photon energy. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact effect here.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect, but when you calculate the luminosity, you have to correct for that. Hmm.

Wait, let me think in terms of flux. The flux F is the energy per unit area per unit time received from the star. The flux is related to the star's luminosity and distance. But in this problem, maybe the distance isn't a factor because they're talking about the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars were observed to have the same peak wavelengths. So, without considering Doppler shift, their temperatures would be same, hence same T. But if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. So the observed λ_max would be shorter. But the problem says the observed λ_max are the same, meaning that the Doppler shift must have been accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame of the stars. So when calculating luminosity, we have to take into account the Doppler shift. Because when a star moves, the observed flux changes. So I think the formula for flux considering Doppler shift would be F = (L / (4πd²)) * (1 + v_r / c)², but I'm not entirely sure. I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the observed temperature. Because the star's actual temperature is T, but due to Doppler shift, the observed temperature might be T_observed = T * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But if the observed λ_max is the same, then perhaps the Doppler effect has been factored in.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's break down what each part contributes.

First, let's compute the intrinsic luminosity. Luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4. For Star_2, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

If the stars have the same observed λ_max, which is λ_max = b / T_obs, but considering Doppler shift, the actual temperature of Star_2 might be different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same, which is due to the Doppler effect.

So, for Star_1, it's at rest, so its observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is positive if moving away. Wait, but if it's moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer, so λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). Since λ_max is the same as Star_1, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So:

λ1 = b / T1.

λ2_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

But λ1 = λ2_obs:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Simplify, cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is >1, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c), which would make T2 > T1? But wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying lower temperature. So if the observed λ_max is same as Star_1 (λ1), and Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature is lower than T1.

Wait, perhaps I have the Doppler shift formula wrong. Let me think again. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer. So for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength.

But the problem says the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So:

λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

But λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = λ1_rest.

So:

b / T2 * (1 + v2/c) = b / T1.

Cancel b:

(1 + v2/c) / T2 = 1 / T1.

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). 

Wait, but if v2 is positive (moving away), then T2 would be higher than T1. But that can't be, because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, implying lower temperature. So I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away. So for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c). But since λ2_obs equals λ1_rest, which is λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, putting it together:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then T2 is higher than T1. That doesn't make sense because moving away would make the observed wavelength longer, implying lower temperature. Hmm, maybe I have the formula backwards. Could it be λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (c + v_observer) / (c + v_source) ) )? Wait, that's when the source is moving away. Oh, right, the relativistic Doppler shift is more accurately given by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ) when the source is moving away. No, wait, that's for transverse Doppler effect, maybe. Or perhaps I should consider the non-relativistic approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if the source is moving away.

So in that case, if Star_2 is moving away, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

But since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, and λ_rest_1 = b / T1, λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So:

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

Which gives:

1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is higher than T1 because v2 is positive (moving away). But that contradicts the expectation because if a star is moving away, its observed temperature would appear lower, right? Because the wavelength would be longer, implying lower temperature.

Ah, I think I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me correct.

If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted (rest) wavelength. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity away (positive). So, when you observe a star moving away, the wavelength is longer, which means the temperature appears lower.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So:

λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

But λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (since Star_1 isn't moving, v=0).

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

So:

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest is related to temperature as λ_rest = b / T.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), that would make T2 higher than T1. But that doesn't make sense because if a star is moving away, it's observed as cooler, meaning T_obs is lower. But according to the formula, T_rest is higher. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, so we have to adjust the calculated T.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because the observed wavelength is the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different. So when calculating luminosity, which depends on the actual (intrinsic) temperature, we need to correct for the Doppler effect.

So, the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual temperatures of the two stars are different because of their velocities.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the luminosity they compute is based on the observed flux, which accounts for Doppler shift.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses the intrinsic temperature, not the observed. So if the observed wavelength is affected by Doppler shift, the intrinsic temperature would be different.

Wait, so for Star_1, it's at rest, so observed λ_max is the same as intrinsic λ_max. So T1 = b / λ_max_1.

For Star_2, observed λ_max is same, but it's moving away. So:

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_max_1.

So,

λ_rest_2 = λ_max_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = λ_max_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_max_1 = b / T1. So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c).

Simplify:

1/T2 = (1/(T1)) / (1 + v2/c).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is greater than T1.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, that's counterintuitive because if Star_2 is moving away, shouldn't it appear cooler, not hotter? Oh, but when you calculate the intrinsic temperature, because the observed wavelength is longer, the actual (intrinsic) temperature is higher.

Wait, wait, let me think again.

If a star is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than the intrinsic λ_max. Because the light is redshifted.

So, intrinsic λ_max (λ_rest) is shorter than observed λ_max (λ_obs). Because for a star moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, λ_obs is longer than λ_rest. But in this problem, λ_obs for both stars is the same.

So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_rest_1.

Because Star_1's λ_obs is the same as Star_2's, and Star_1 is at rest, so λ_rest_1 = λ_obs_1.

So,

λ_rest_2 = λ_obs_1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

λ_rest_1 = b / T1.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b:

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v2/c)).

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is higher than T1. So, now when we compute the luminosities, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4, L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

But R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

And T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). But v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v2/c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

v2 = 700 km/s.

So,

v2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So,

T2/T1 ≈ 1.0023333.

So, (T2/T1)^4 ≈ (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute that. 1.0023333^4.

Approximate using binomial expansion:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... for small x.

x=0.002333.

n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * 0.000005444 ≈ 0.00003266.

Fourth term: 4 * 3 * 2/(6) * (0.002333)^3 = (4*3*2)/(6) x^3 = 4 x^3 → 4*(0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.0000000128 ≈ 0.0000000512.

Which is negligible.

So total is approximately 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003266 ≈ 1.00936466.

So (T2/T1)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, because L is proportional to R² T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We have R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1/T2 = 1/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Again, using binomial approx for (1 - x)^4 where x=0.00233:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x³ + x^4.

x=0.00233.

So,

1 -4*(0.00233) = 1 -0.00932 = 0.99068.

+6*(0.00233)^2 = 6*(0.00000543) ≈ 0.0000326.

-4*(0.00233)^3 ≈ -4*(0.0000000128) ≈ -0.000000051.

+ x^4 ≈ negligible.

So,

≈ 0.99068 + 0.0000326 = 0.9907126.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2268.

Which is approximately 2.23. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the factor is about 2.23, so the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would be 2.25, but considering the Doppler shift, it's a bit less because T2 is higher, making L2 higher than it would be without the Doppler effect. Wait, wait, wait, no. Because T2 is higher than T1, the luminosity would be higher for Star_2. But the question is what's the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, no, the problem says L1 is greater than L2 by a factor. So, let me double-check.

Wait, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → T2 is larger.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4 → 4π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4 → 4π R2² σ T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = [2.25 R2² T1^4 ] / [ R2² T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 ] ].

Simplify:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4.

Wait, wait a second. I think I had a mistake earlier.

Because when I had L1 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4.

But T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v2/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.002333))^4 ≈ 2.25 * (approx 0.9907) → 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2268, which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought of it as 2.25 without considering the Doppler effect. So the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D.

So the initial assumption that the temperatures are the same was wrong because of the Doppler shift. So I have to account for that.

So the answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - The radial velocities are \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_1 and \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_2.
   - The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) of both stars are the same, implying that the Doppler effect must be accounted for when calculating intrinsic temperatures.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is therefore:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]

3. **Temperature Adjustment for Doppler Shift**:
   The observed peak wavelength is related to the intrinsic temperature by Wien's law:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is the same for both stars, the intrinsic temperatures must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}}{1 + v/c}
   \]
   For Star_2, moving away with velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the intrinsic temperature is:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**:
   The ratio of temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
   \]
   Raising this to the fourth power:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]
   With \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \), we calculate:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]
   Combining this with \( \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2268
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately \( 2.23 \).

**Answer: D**
