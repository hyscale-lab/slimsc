Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and try to unpack it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix is given as A_y = c * S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0].

Hmm, wait a second. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, I have to determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct based on that calculation.

First, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 and -i, the second is i and 0. So S looks like:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Then, A_y is c multiplied by S. Since c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, A_y is:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is 2x2, and A_y is c multiplied by each element of S. So each element is c times the corresponding element in S.

So A_y is:

[0 * c   (-i)*c ]
[i*c     0 ]

Which becomes:

[0       (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))     0 ]

So that's the matrix we're dealing with. Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to compute the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ -λ       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

(-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Let me compute that. (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ) = 1. So that term is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So solving λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a minute. The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of them talk about imaginary parts. Because the matrix A_y is Hermitian? Let me check. Wait, no, wait. The operator A_y is part of the angular momentum, which should be Hermitian, right? Because angular momentum operators are observables, so their matrices should be Hermitian.

Wait, wait. Let me check if A_y is Hermitian. The matrix A_y is:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

The conjugate transpose of A_y would swap the off-diagonal elements and take conjugates. So the (1,2) element is (-i h)/(4π), its conjugate is (i h)/(4π), which would be the (2,1) element. So the conjugate transpose is:

[ 0       (i h)/(4π) ]
[ (-i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Which is the same as A_y. Because in A_y, the (2,1) element is (i h)/(4π), which is the same as (i h)/(4π). So yes, A_y is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real.

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, ± h/(4π). So any option that claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A isn't correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Since A is part of the angular momentum, A squared should commute with A_y. So their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Az is another component, which may not commute with A_y, so their eigenfunctions are different. So if the same function is an eigenfunction of both A_y and A², but not of Az, that's possible. So statement C could be correct. But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation; perhaps the eigenvectors are correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, basis functions would be the eigenvectors, perhaps. So whether the eigenfunctions φ are the basis of the matrix operator. Hmm. Well, the matrix operator is 2x2, so it should have two eigenvectors, which form a basis. So statement D might be correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but earlier we found the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B are out.

So between C and D. Let me think about C. The statement says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A is the angular momentum operator, its square would be the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because the square of the angular momentum commutes with any component, so they share eigenfunctions. But for Az, which is another component, the operator A_y and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Wait, but then, the statement in C says 'can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.' So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at option D: 'The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' I'm a bit confused. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2. Its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So D is correct in that sense.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, the question is about which statement will be considered correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvectors of Ay would form an orthogonal basis because the matrix is Hermitian. So the statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So that's correct because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors, forming a basis.

So, considering all that, which statement is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² commutes with Ay, they should share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct—so which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Option D says, "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Hmm, the eigenfunctions being the basis functions. Well, in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (assuming they're non-degenerate, which they are here) will form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think differently. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it's in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) will form a basis for that space. So D is correct.

So, which of the options is correct.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the operator. That's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space that the operator acts on.

Alternatively, if the matrix operator is represented in the basis of its eigenfunctions, then that basis would diagonalize the matrix Ay, which is a natural choice.

So D is correct, because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator's space.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me go back to the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since in quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum commutes with each component. So the eigenfunctions of Ay will indeed be eigenfunctions of A². But they won't be eigenfunctions of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something.

Wait, no. The commutator [Ay, Az] = i ħ A (maybe A_x?), but the point is that they don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

So, which options are correct?

Now, the problem says which statement is correct during the calculation. So in the calculation, when finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π), so options A and B are incorrect because they suggest imaginary parts.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which is also correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. Wait, but the options are presented as single choices.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors. So perhaps more than one could be correct, but the options are given as A, B, C, D, so only one is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the process. The problem requires us to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then during that calculation, which statement is correct.

Hmm, perhaps during the calculation, the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the operator. So statement D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, which is a fundamental property.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should try to find which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) which are real. So in the options, options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

So that leaves C and D.

Wait, another approach: because the operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal (since it's Hermitian), so the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space. So statement D is correct: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So I think D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement C is correct because the same eigenfunction can be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is equal to ħ² (s(s+1)), where s is the spin quantum number (for a muon, which is a lepton, s=1/2).

Wait, but in this case, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum. So A² would be (ħ^2) (s(s+1)), which is a scalar. So when you take a state to be an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². Because A² commutes with all components.

So statement C is correct. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So during the calculation, you would consider that statement correct.

Wait, but what about statement D? It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. But the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both statements C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the operator.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the operator's matrix is 2x2. Its eigenvectors form a basis, so any vector can be expressed as a combination of these eigenvectors. So statement D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all components, so yes, the same eigenfunctions apply. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Yes, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options probably only have one correct answer. The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S has eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts, but no—earlier calculation shows that the eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting imaginary parts is wrong.

Wait, perhaps looking back, the matrix S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factor. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So the eigenvalues of S would be ±1. Then, A_y is c times S, so the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π).

So options A and B are out because they have imaginary parts.

So which is correct: C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar (same for all directions), the eigenfunctions of any component (like Ay) are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because the components don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, each option is a statement during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, the correct conclusion is that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the same functions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of another component.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: the square of the operator Ay would not necessarily be the same as the square of the total angular momentum A^2. Wait, no, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator, so A^2 is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2). So when you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's an eigenstate of A^2 as well because A^2 commutes with Ay.

Wait, but I'm confident that option C is correct, because the same eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². Therefore, during calculation, you would consider statement C correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option. Or perhaps the question expects us to choose option C because the others are incorrect.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options are:

A) eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

B) eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No.

C) eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Yes.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Yes.

So I'm torn between C and D.

Wait, the operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so it's in a two-dimensional space. Its eigenvectors must form a basis for that space, so statement D is correct.

But in the case of spin-½ particles, the eigenfunctions of S_y (the spin in y-direction) are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction, which form a basis for the Hilbert space. So statement D is correct.

But so is statement C. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct. So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: when you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Therefore, statement D is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm getting a little confused. Let me summarize:

Eigenvalues: ± h/(4π) (real)

Eigenvectors: orthogonal and form a basis.

So statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis.

Statement C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So both C and D are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, I think I'll go with option C being correct.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = h/4\pi \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue and \( \phi \) is the eigenfunction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is given as:
   \[
   S = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   Multiplying by \( c = h/4\pi \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y \), the determinant becomes:
   \[
   \det \begin{bmatrix}
   -\lambda & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\
   \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda
   \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0
   \]
   Solving this, the eigenvalues are:
   \[
   \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}
   \]
   These are real numbers, so any option suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm h/4\pi \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 1/2 \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect for the same reason as A.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared, but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 Hermitian matrix form a basis for the two-dimensional space.

4. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct during the calculation. Since the focus is on the relationship between eigenfunctions and other operators, **option C** is the most relevant and correct choice.

### Conclusion:
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This makes option C the correct answer.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and try to unpack it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix is given as A_y = c * S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0].

Hmm, wait a second. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, I have to determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct based on that calculation.

First, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 and -i, the second is i and 0. So S looks like:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Then, A_y is c multiplied by S. Since c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, A_y is:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is 2x2, and A_y is c multiplied by each element of S. So each element is c times the corresponding element in S.

So A_y is:

[0 * c   (-i)*c ]
[i*c     0 ]

Which becomes:

[0       (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))     0 ]

So that's the matrix we're dealing with. Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to compute the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ -λ       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

(-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Let me compute that. (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ) = 1. So that term is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So solving λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a minute. The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of them talk about imaginary parts. Because the matrix A_y is Hermitian? Let me check. Wait, no, wait. The operator A_y is part of the angular momentum, which should be Hermitian, right? Because angular momentum operators are observables, so their matrices should be Hermitian.

Wait, wait. Let me check if A_y is Hermitian. The matrix A_y is:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

The conjugate transpose of A_y would swap the off-diagonal elements and take conjugates. So the (1,2) element is (-i h)/(4π), its conjugate is (i h)/(4π), which would be the (2,1) element. So the conjugate transpose is:

[ 0       (i h)/(4π) ]
[ (-i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Which is the same as A_y. Because in A_y, the (2,1) element is (i h)/(4π), which is the same as (i h)/(4π). So yes, A_y is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real.

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, ± h/(4π). So any option that claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A isn't correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Since A is part of the angular momentum, A squared should commute with A_y. So their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Az is another component, which may not commute with A_y, so their eigenfunctions are different. So if the same function is an eigenfunction of both A_y and A², but not of Az, that's possible. So statement C could be correct. But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation; perhaps the eigenvectors are correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, basis functions would be the eigenvectors, perhaps. So whether the eigenfunctions φ are the basis of the matrix operator. Hmm. Well, the matrix operator is 2x2, so it should have two eigenvectors, which form a basis. So statement D might be correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but earlier we found the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B are out.

So between C and D. Let me think about C. The statement says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A is the angular momentum operator, its square would be the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because the square of the angular momentum commutes with any component, so they share eigenfunctions. But for Az, which is another component, the operator A_y and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Wait, but then, the statement in C says 'can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.' So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at option D: 'The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' I'm a bit confused. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2. Its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So D is correct in that sense.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, the question is about which statement will be considered correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvectors of Ay would form an orthogonal basis because the matrix is Hermitian. So the statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So that's correct because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors, forming a basis.

So, considering all that, which statement is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² commutes with Ay, they should share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct—so which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Option D says, "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Hmm, the eigenfunctions being the basis functions. Well, in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (assuming they're non-degenerate, which they are here) will form a basis. So D is correct.

So the eigenfunctions of Ay will indeed be eigenfunctions of A². But they won't be eigenfunctions of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something.

Wait, no. The commutator [Ay, Az] = i ħ A (maybe A_x?), but the point is that they don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

So, which options are correct?

Now, the problem says which statement is correct during the calculation. So in the calculation, when finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π), so options A and B are incorrect because they suggest imaginary parts.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which is also correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. Wait, but the options are presented as single choices.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors. So perhaps more than one could be correct, but the options are given as A, B, C, D, so only one is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the process. The problem requires us to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then during that calculation, which statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, which is a fundamental property.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should try to find which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) which are real. So in the options, options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

So that leaves C and D.

Wait, another approach: because the operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal (since it's Hermitian), so the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space. So statement D is correct: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So I think D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement C is correct because the same eigenfunction can be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is equal to ħ² (s(s+1)), where s is the spin quantum number (for a muon, which is a lepton, s=1/2).

Wait, but in this case, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum. So A² would be (ħ^2) (s(s+1)), which is a scalar. So when you take a state to be an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². Because A² commutes with all components.

So statement C is correct. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So during the calculation, you would consider that statement correct.

Wait, but what about statement D? It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. But the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both statements C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the operator.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the operator's matrix is 2x2. Its eigenvectors form a basis, so any vector can be expressed as a combination of these eigenvectors. So statement D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all components, so yes, the same eigenfunctions apply. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Yes, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options probably only have one correct answer. The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S has eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts, but no—earlier calculation shows that the eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting imaginary parts is wrong.

Wait, perhaps looking back, the matrix S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factor. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So the eigenvalues of S would be ±1. Then, A_y is c times S, so the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π).

So options A and B are out because they have imaginary parts.

So which is correct: C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar (same for all directions), the eigenfunctions of any component (like Ay) are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because the components don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, each option is a statement during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, the correct conclusion is that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the same functions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of another component.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: the square of the operator Ay would not necessarily be the same as the square of the total angular momentum A^2. Wait, no, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator, so A^2 is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2). So when you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's an eigenstate of A^2 as well because A^2 commutes with Ay.

Wait, but I'm confident that option C is correct, because the same eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². Therefore, during calculation, you would consider statement C correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option. Or perhaps the question expects us to choose option C because the others are incorrect.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options are:

A) eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

B) eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No.

C) eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Yes.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Yes.

So I'm torn between C and D.

Wait, the operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so it's in a two-dimensional space. Its eigenvectors must form a basis for that space, so statement D is correct.

But in the case of spin-½ particles, the eigenfunctions of S_y (the spin in y-direction) are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction, which form a basis for the Hilbert space. So statement D is correct.

But so is statement C. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is correct. So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: when you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Therefore, statement D is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm getting a little confused. Let me summarize:

Eigenvalues: ± h/(4π) (real)

Eigenvectors: orthogonal and form a basis.

So statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis.

Statement C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So both C and D are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, I think I'll go with option C being correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = h/4\pi \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue and \( \phi \) is the eigenfunction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is given as:
   \[
   S = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   Multiplying by \( c = h/4\pi \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y \), the determinant becomes:
   \[
   \det \begin{bmatrix}
   -\lambda & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\
   \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda
   \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0
   \]
   Solving this, the eigenvalues are:
   \[
   \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}
   \]
   These are real numbers, so any option suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm h/4\pi \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 1/2 \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect for the same reason as A.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared, but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 Hermitian matrix form a basis for the two-dimensional space.

4. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct during the calculation. Since the focus is on the relationship between eigenfunctions and other operators, **option C** is the most relevant and correct choice.

### Conclusion:
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This makes option C the correct answer.

**Answer: C**
