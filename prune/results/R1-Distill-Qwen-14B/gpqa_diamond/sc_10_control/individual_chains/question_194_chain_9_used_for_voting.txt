Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, so I'll have to compute Z and see which one matches.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, right? The Boltzmann factor is exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But since the energy is given in terms of S1, S2, S3, I need to figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. I should list them all and calculate the energy for each.

Let me think. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now for each state, compute E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute each term step by step.

State 1: All +1.
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: 3
E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: S3=-1, others +1.
S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: S2=-1, others +1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1
E = J

State 4: S2=-1, S3=-1, others +1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1
E = J

Wait, no. Wait, S3 is -1. So S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1
Sum: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1
So E = - J * (-1) = J.

State 5: S1=-1, others +1.

S1S2= (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3= (+1)(+1) = +1
Sum: -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1
E = J.

State 6: S1=-1, S3=-1, others +1.

Wait, S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1
S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) = -1
E= J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2= (+1), because (-1)(-1)=1.
S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = J.

State 8: All -1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1) = 1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) =1
Sum: 3
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, so let's tabulate all the energies:

1. -3J → E = -3J

2. J

3. J

4. J

5. J

6. J

7. J

8. -3J → E = -3J

So, in the 8 states, two have energy -3J, and six have energy J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum of exp( -β E ) for each state.

Each of the two states with E=-3J contributes exp( -β*(-3J) ) = exp(3βJ).

Each of the six states with E=J contributes exp( -β*J ), which is exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{J β} → No, because for E=-3J, the exponent is positive 3Jβ.

Wait, no. Wait: The Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E). So for E = -3J, that becomes exp(3β J). For E=J, it's exp(-beta J).

So Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β} → Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes.

Option C: 2 e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6 e^{2Jβ} + 2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Wait, why does the exponent for Jβ come in as Jβ and not 2Jβ?

Wait, because each term with E=J contributes exp(-beta J), and each term with E=-3J contributes exp(3 beta J). So yes, option B is correct.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **List all possible states**: Each spin has two possible states (\( +1 \) or \( -1 \)), so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) states in total. These states are:
   - \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
   - \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
   - \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
   - \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
   - \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
   - \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
   - \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
   - \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

2. **Calculate the energy for each state**: Using \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), the energy for each state is computed:
   - \( (+1, +1, +1) \): \( E = -3J \)
   - \( (+1, +1, -1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (+1, -1, +1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (+1, -1, -1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (-1, +1, +1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (-1, +1, -1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (-1, -1, +1) \): \( E = J \)
   - \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( E = -3J \)

3. **Classify states by energy**:
   - Two states have \( E = -3J \).
   - Six states have \( E = J \).

4. **Compute the partition function**: The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:
   \[
   Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}
   \]
   - For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \).
   - For the six states with \( E = J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta J} \).

   Thus:
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}
   \]

5. **Match with the options**:
   - Option A: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, signs of exponents are wrong).
   - Option B: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
   - Option C: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, exponents are wrong).
   - Option D: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, exponents and coefficients are wrong).

The correct answer is **Option B**.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now for each state, compute E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute each term step by step.

State 1: All +1.
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: 3
E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: S3=-1, others +1.
S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: S2=-1, others +1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1
E = J

State 4: S2=-1, S3=-1, others +1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1
E = J

Wait, no. Wait, S3 is -1. So S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1
Sum: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1
So E = - J * (-1) = J.

State 5: S1=-1, others +1.

S1S2= (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3= (+1)(+1) = +1
Sum: -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1
E = J.

State 6: S1=-1, S3=-1, others +1.

Wait, S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1
S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) = -1
E= J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2= (+1), because (-1)(-1)=1.
S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3= (-1)(+1) = -1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = J.

State 8: All -1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1) = 1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) =1
Sum: 3
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, so let's tabulate all the energies:

1. -3J → E = -3J

2. J

3. J

4. J

5. J

6. J

7. J

8. -3J → E = -3J

So, in the 8 states, two have energy -3J, and six have energy J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum of exp( -β E ) for each state.

Each of the two states with E=-3J contributes exp( -β*(-3J) ) = exp(3βJ).

Each of the six states with E=J contributes exp( -β*J ), which is exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{J β} → No, because for E=-3J, the exponent is positive 3Jβ.

Wait, no. Wait: The Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E). So for E = -3J, that becomes exp(3β J). For E=J, it's exp(-beta J).

So Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β} → Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes.

Option C: 2 e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6 e^{2Jβ} + 2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Wait, why does the exponent for Jβ come in as Jβ and not 2Jβ?

Wait, because each term with E=J contributes exp(-beta J), and each term with E=-3J contributes exp(3 beta J). So yes, option B is correct.
