Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to resistance. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each. The question is about the interaction among these genes, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The data given is the resistance percentages. Let's list them:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (so no resistance)
- g3: 50% (half the resistance)
Double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, and they mentioned that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So that probably means it's regulating others.

I remember that when you have epistatic relationships, one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So in epistasis, the pathway matters. Like, if Gene A is upstream of Gene B, then knocking out A would have a more severe phenotype than knocking out B, assuming they're in the same pathway.

Let me think about each single mutant:

- g2 has 0% resistance, meaning it's completely susceptible. So G2 is probably a critical gene. Could it be the transcription factor, since it's a single mutant showing the most severe phenotype? Because if it's a TF, it might regulate other genes that contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, maybe none of the downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance.

Looking at g1, it's 75% resistance. So without G1, the plant is less resistant but not completely susceptible. So G1 might be part of a redundant pathway or maybe downstream of the primary pathway.

g3 is 50% resistance. So that's even lower than g1. Hmm, not sure yet.

Now the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. But wait, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So in the double mutant where both g2 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only g2 is out. That suggests that G3's function is perhaps downstream or dependent on G2. Alternatively, maybe G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is not working.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G1 and G2 doesn't make it worse than just losing G2. That suggests that G1's function is perhaps not contributing when G2 is already knocked out. But wait, if G2 is a TF, then maybe G1 is downstream of G2. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so knocking both out doesn't add anything beyond g2. That makes sense.

Wait, but g1's single mutant is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So when G1 is missing, it's not as bad as G3 missing. But in the double g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So the combined effect is much worse. That suggests that G3 adds to the function of G1, maybe they are in parallel pathways or something.

Let me think about epistasis. If two genes are in the same pathway, and one is upstream, the double mutant may not show a more severe phenotype than the more severe single mutant. But if they're in parallel pathways (redundant), then knocking both out would have a greater effect.

Wait, let's consider the double mutants:

g2g3: 0% same as g2. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, or G3's function is redundant with something else that's already gone.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0% same as g2. So G1's function isn't adding anything when G2 is already knocked out.

What about the g1g3 double mutant? Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, and the resistance is 10%. So if each single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%) when combined, the effect is additive? Or perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but how does this relate to being transcription factors and epistasis?

If G2 is a transcription factor, it might regulate both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed (assuming they are downstream targets). So in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 aren't working. Hence, the resistance is 0%. But wait, in the single mutants, g1 is at 75%, and g3 is at 50%. So if G2 is a TF, then in g1, maybe G2 is still present and can regulate G3, so the plant still has some resistance (75%). In g3 mutant, perhaps G2 is functioning, but since G3 is not, the resistance is 50%. But wait, if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 expression. So the resistance would be same as when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Hmm, but in the data, g2 is 0%, and the double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%. So that fits.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance. So when both are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone.

But then why is the resistance 10% in g1g3? Let's think: in the wild type, G1 and G3 are probably contributing to the resistance. If each contributes, say, 75% and 50%, but that's probably not additive. Hmm, but the percentages aren't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so each contributes a part of the resistance. So without G1, the resistance is 75%, and without G3, 50%. So if both are knocked out, the resistance would be 75% + 50% - 100% (wait, that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps without both, the resistance is additive, but not beyond 100%. So maybe 75 + 50 = 125, but since you can't have more than 100%, the maximum is 100%, so perhaps the double mutant would be 25% (75% + 50% - 100%). But in the data, it's 10% instead. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe there's more going on.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but in a way that they have some overlapping functions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if G2 is epistatic over G1, then knocking out G2 would mask the effect of G1. But in our data, knocking out both G1 and G2 (g1g2) gives 0%, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because without G2, G1 doesn't contribute anything. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, for the g2g3 double mutant: same as g2. So without G2, G3's function doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

So, G2 is a transcription factor, and both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

So, when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to complete susceptibility (0%).

In the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. That's better than g2, so perhaps other genes are contributing. Similarly, g3 is 50% resistance.

In the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%—this is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. Without both, the resistance is much lower.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF upstream of both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, which is the same as knocking out G2 (since without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed), why isn't the resistance 0%? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Because in the double mutant g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is still present. So if G2 is a TF, it's expressing G1 and G3. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2's function is not enough to provide any resistance? That's not making sense. Because in that case, without G1 and G3, but with G2, why isn't resistance normal?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let's think again.

The problem says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are regulated by G2.

So when G2 is present, it's activating G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance. So in g1, you can't make G1 product, but G2 is still working, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance. Similarly, in g3, G2 is working, G1 is expressed, but without G3, resistance is 50%. 

In the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. But since G2 is still present and functional, maybe G2 is activating other genes as well that contribute 10% of the resistance. Or perhaps G2's own function is part of the resistance, so even without G1 and G3, the plant still has some resistance.

Wait, but the g2 mutant is 0%, meaning that without G2, even with G1 and G3, the resistance is gone. So G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 to function.

So, in g1g3, G2 is still present, so G2 is active. But G1 and G3 are knocked out. So perhaps G2 itself has some function beyond just regulating G1 and G3. So, without G1 and G3, but with G2, you get 10% resistance. So G2's own function contributes 10%, and G1 and G3 contribute the rest.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, g2 is 0%. If G1 were the TF, then knocking out G1 would prevent downstream genes from being expressed. But in g1, the resistance is 75%, not 0%, so that doesn't fit. So probably G1 isn't the TF.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulatory region, maybe same regulation), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if they have the same promoter, why are their single mutants different? Well, maybe their individual products contribute differently. But I'm not sure about this.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone, which suggests they are additive, not epistatic. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So in the absence of one, the other can take over. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, which suggests they don't fully compensate. So redundancy might not fit. But also, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But the data's double mutant g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either single, so they contribute additively, which contradicts epistasis.

Wait, but perhaps if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is upstream, then G1 is epistatic. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the epistatic relationships: when two genes are in the same pathway, the one that's upstream (the TF) is epistatic to the downstream gene.

So if G2 is the TF, it's upstream of G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%—so perhaps each contributes some, and when both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is 10%, which might be the contribution from other genes. So maybe 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) = 125% but capped at 100%, but that doesn't explain 10%. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So without G2, both are knocked out, and resistance is 0%. But when G2 is present, and only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can contribute. So that would fit.

In the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, but G2 is present. So G2 must be doing something else. But why resistance is 10% then? Maybe G2 has a minor role, and other genes contribute 10%.

But the key is to determine the relationships.

Looking again at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10%

This suggests that G2 is the only one whose knockout completely determines the phenotype, and when G2 is present, the other genes (G1 and G3) contribute.

So G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. So in the double mutants with G2 present (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution when both are present.

So G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance but through separate pathways. So they are in parallel pathways, not in series.

In that case, knocking both out would lead to a much lower resistance than either single.

So from this, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, possibly in parallel pathways.

Epistatic relationships: Since G2 is upstream, it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic over both.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout leads to 0%, which would suggest it's the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure about same promoter. Also, G3 epistatic towards G1? But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so probably additive. So B might not be correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means same gene affecting multiple traits—probably not the case here. G1 and G3 are separate genes.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that when one is knocked out, the other can compensate. But in the data, the single mutants have lower resistance than wild type, but not 0. So, if they were redundant, perhaps each alone would not be enough, but together they are. But the data shows that when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is even worse. So maybe they're not fully redundant. Hmm, but if they are redundant, their double mutant's effect would be the same as each single mutant. But in this case, the double mutant is worse, so redundancy might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe their functions are additive. So each contributes some resistance, and together they contribute more. But in the presence of G2, which is a TF, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both targets of G2, and when G2 is active, both are expressed, leading to maximum resistance. Without G2, nothing. But when only one is knocked out, the other can contribute some resistance. So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, each in their own pathways.

In the double mutant g1g3, without both, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single. So, each contributes something, and their combined absence makes it worse.

So, which option matches this?

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking both out would have the same effect as knocking one out. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either, so that's not redundancy. So D might be incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy would mean that a gene affects multiple traits, but here G1 and G3 are separate, so probably not.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but their single mutants have different phenotypes. So maybe this is possible. But why would G3 be epistatic over G1?

Epistatic means that the effect of one masks the other. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, so it's additive, not epistatic.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of a G3 mutation would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which is additive. So perhaps this is not the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about which options are correct based on the data.

The key points from the data:

1. G2 knockout (g2) leads to 0% resistance. So G2 is critical, likely a regulatory gene (like a TF) upstream of others.

2. G1 knockout (g1) leads to 75% resistance. So G1 contributes, but not as much as G2.

3. G3 knockout (g3) leads to 50% resistance. So G3 contributes, but less than G1.

4. Double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have 0% resistance, same as g2. So the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance when G1 or G3 are knocked out.

5. The double mutant g1g3 leads to 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, resistance is worse than either single mutant.

So from this, G2 is the main gene, acting upstream, perhaps a TF.

The interaction between G1 and G3 must be additive. So when both are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone. Hence, they are in separate pathways or contribute in a way that their functions are additive.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that if one is present, the other can compensate. But the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single, so they don't fully compensate. So perhaps they're not redundant. So D might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe gene redundancy isn't the case, but additive. So the correct option would be that G1 and G3 are additive, and G2 is the upstream TF.

Looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but pleiotropy isn't about additive effects. That's about a single gene affecting multiple traits. So probably not.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is the one with 0%, so G1 can't be the TF. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but their single mutants have different effects (75% and 50%). So that's possible—maybe they have the same promoter but different expression levels or other factors.

But what about G3 being epistatic towards G1? If G3 is epistatic, then the g1 mutation would be masked in the presence of G3. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests additive, not epistatic.

Wait, perhaps if G3 is epistatic over G1, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as the more severe single mutant. But in the data, it's worse, so that can't be. So perhaps B is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I need to choose the best fit.

Wait, another approach: which options align with the epistatic relationships.

We have G2 as the TF, so it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, same issue.

Wait, maybe the correct option is C.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy is not about additive effects, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But earlier reasoning suggests that when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the effect is additive, which would be more consistent with them being in parallel pathways rather than redundant. So in that case, the double mutant's resistance would be additive, which is what we see (10% compared to 75% and 50%).

Wait, but wait. If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then their contributions are additive. So without G1, the resistance is 75% (so other pathways contribute 25%); without G3, 50%. So without both, 75% (from G3) +50% (from G1) minus 100% (since that's the maximum) would be 25%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other downstream genes. So when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed, contributing to resistance. When G2 is absent, no G1 or G3 expression, so resistance is 0%.

But when only G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance. When only G3 is knocked out (g3), G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, but why would G3 contribute less than G1? Maybe because G1 is a more effective downstream gene, or perhaps G3 is in a less efficient pathway.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 are present. But since G2 is active, perhaps G2 has some residual function, leading to 10% resistance. So the 10% is from G2's own activity, not from G1 or G3.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Their functions are additive, but they don't compensate for each other.

Looking at the options again, which option aligns with this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if they're redundant, the double mutant should have the same as either single, but the data shows it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy, and the epistatic part doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter could mean they're co-regulated, but the single mutants have different effects. So maybe this is possible. But epistatic part doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is option D, but not because of redundancy. Maybe D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1+G3, but the data shows worse. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Wait, not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of what each option says about the epistatic relationships.

The question is about which conclusion we can draw regarding their interactions.

Another angle: what does the data say about the relationship between G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So each contributes some, and their effects are additive. That suggests that their functions are not redundant and are in separate pathways.

So, G1 and G3 are additive, meaning their functions are not dependent on each other. So when both are missing, the effect is additive.

So which options fit that?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that would mean that their functions are the same, and their combined knockout would not be worse than either single. But in the data, it's worse. So D is probably incorrect.

So, the correct answer must be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, but that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are both targets. So without G2, both are knocked out. But in the presence of G2, each contributes.

But the data shows that the double mutant (g1g3) is worse than either single, implying their functions are additive. So they are in parallel pathways.

So which option says that G1 and G3 are in parallel, additive pathways and G2 is the TF?

Looking back, none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the correct option is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, no, because redundancy would mean their combined knockout doesn't make it worse than either. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look again at each option's specifics.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So if G1 is epistatic over G3, the presence of G1 would mask G3's effect. But in the data, g3 has lower resistance than g1, which suggests that G3 is contributing less than G1.

Wait, perhaps G1 is epistatic over G3, meaning that G3's effect is only seen when G1 is not present. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out at 50%. So that doesn't fit the idea of G1 being epistatic over G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic over G1. Then, if G3 is present, G1's effect is masked. But when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1 would be seen. But in the data, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%, which is the opposite.

I'm getting stuck. Let's approach this with the information that G2 is the TF and the other genes are downstream.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively. So their double knockout would have a more severe phenotype than each single.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy would not lead to additive effects.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because pleiotropy isn't about additive effects.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter, but their single mutants have different effects. So perhaps they are co-regulated but have different functions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but that doesn't align with the data either.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is the worst. The presence of G2 allows some resistance because G2 itself may have a minor role. So perhaps G2 is a TF for other genes besides G1 and G3, which contribute 10% resistance.

So the hierarchy is: G2 (TF) → G1 and G3 → downstream genes → resistance.

In the presence of G2, knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance, but when both are knocked out, only some resistance remains.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, likely in separate pathways.

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy doesn't fit. So this can't be.

So, perhaps the correct option is not listed here, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not seeing why. Let's read it again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, if G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined knockout would be same as either single, but the data shows it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (worse than either single)

This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, G2 is the upstream gene.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, implying that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, each contributes some, and when both are missing, the effect is additive.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, their functions are additive.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, not two genes. So that's probably not correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated. But their single mutants have different effects, which is possible. But why does the double mutant g1g3 have worse resistance?

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single. But it's worse, so that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: let's think which option correctly describes that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 contribute additively.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit the data.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2's single mutant is 0%, so G2 can't be downstream of G1. So G1 can't be the TF.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to pick the best option based on the data.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So their double mutant is worse than either single, indicating additive effects.

Looking at the options, the only option that mentions G2 as the TF is options A, B, C, D.

Now, which option fits the additive effect?

Looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: possible. But G3 is epistatic towards G1 would mean the double mutant g1g3 would have same as G3's single, but data shows worse.

So perhaps this is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because pleiotropy is not additive.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but without seeing it perfectly fit.

Wait, perhaps "show pleiotropy" in option C is a distractor, and the key is that G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit the data. So the correct answer is not C.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which option correctly identifies the epistatic relationships.

We know that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, because in the double mutants, when G2 is present, the effect is worse than when G2 is knocked out.

But no option directly states that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is masked. But the data shows that in the double mutant, the resistance is worse than either, so that's not epistatic.

Hmm. I think I'm out of time and need to make a best guess.

The data indicates G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 contribute additively. Among the options, option D says G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 have gene redundancy. But that doesn't fit. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not completely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, but that's not matching the data.

Wait, another thought: the double mutant of g1g3 has 10% resistance. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%. Which is the same as when only G2 is active. So perhaps G1 and G3 are the only targets of G2, and when both are missing, G2's own function provides minimal resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are the main targets, and their functions are additive.

Looking again, which option aligns with this?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which they don't because the double mutant is worse.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, another possibility: G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, with G1 upstream of G3. So G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option D because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant in that they can compensate for each other, but their combined knockout isn't as bad as expected. But no, the data shows worse.

Hmm...

I think I'm going to have to choose option D. But I'm not confident.

The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine to determine their roles in anthracnose resistance. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer the genetic relationships, particularly focusing on whether one gene is a transcription factor (TF) and how the genes interact.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild-type but not completely susceptible).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (more susceptible than wild-type but not completely susceptible).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Inferences**:
   - **G2 is critical**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0%) suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.
   - **Additive effects of G1 and G3**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3), indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely through separate pathways.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The resistance levels of g1g2 and g2g3 are identical to g2, meaning G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent with the data, as G2's single mutant (g2) has 0% resistance, indicating G2, not G1, is the TF. Additionally, pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as G2 and G3 do not appear to affect multiple traits in a single gene.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. While G2 being a TF aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Furthermore, G3 being epistatic towards G1 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is not supported here, as G1 and G3 are distinct genes contributing independently to resistance. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 being a TF aligns with the data, gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has additive effects rather than epistasis.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance through separate pathways. However, none of the options perfectly align with the data. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, even though the claims about redundancy and epistasis are not fully consistent with the data.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to resistance. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each. The question is about the interaction among these genes, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The data given is the resistance percentages. Let's list them:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (so no resistance)
- g3: 50% (half the resistance)
Double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, and they mentioned that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So that probably means it's regulating others.

I remember that when you have epistatic relationships, one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So in epistasis, the pathway matters. Like, if Gene A is upstream of Gene B, then knocking out A would have a more severe phenotype than knocking out B, assuming they're in the same pathway.

Let me think about each single mutant:

- g2 has 0% resistance, meaning it's completely susceptible. So G2 is probably a critical gene. Could it be the transcription factor, since it's a single mutant showing the most severe phenotype? Because if it's a TF, it might regulate other genes that contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, maybe none of the downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance.

Looking at g1, it's 75% resistance. So without G1, the plant is less resistant but not completely susceptible. So G1 might be part of a redundant pathway or maybe downstream of the primary pathway.

g3 is 50% resistance. So that's even lower than g1. Hmm, not sure yet.

Now the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. But wait, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So in the double mutant where both g2 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only g2 is out. That suggests that G3's function is perhaps downstream or dependent on G2. Alternatively, maybe G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is not working.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G1 and G2 doesn't make it worse than just losing G2. That suggests that G1's function is perhaps not contributing when G2 is already knocked out. But wait, if G2 is a TF, then maybe G1 is downstream of G2. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so knocking both out doesn't add anything beyond g2. That makes sense.

Wait, but g1's single mutant is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So when G1 is missing, it's not as bad as G3 missing. But in the double g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So the combined effect is much worse. That suggests that G3 adds to the function of G1, maybe they are in parallel pathways or something.

Let me think about epistasis. If two genes are in the same pathway, and one is upstream, the double mutant may not show a more severe phenotype than the more severe single mutant. But if they're in parallel pathways (redundant), then knocking both out would have a greater effect.

Wait, let's consider the double mutants:

g2g3: 0% same as g2. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, or G3's function is redundant with something else that's already gone.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0% same as g2. So G1's function isn't adding anything when G2 is already knocked out.

What about the g1g3 double mutant? Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, and the resistance is 10%. So if each single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%) when combined, the effect is additive? Or perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but how does this relate to being transcription factors and epistasis?

If G2 is a transcription factor, it might regulate both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed (assuming they are downstream targets). So in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 aren't working. Hence, the resistance is 0%. But wait, in the single mutants, g1 is at 75%, and g3 is at 50%. So if G2 is a TF, then in g1, maybe G2 is still present and can regulate G3, so the plant still has some resistance (75%). In g3 mutant, perhaps G2 is functioning, but since G3 is not, the resistance is 50%. But wait, if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 expression. So the resistance would be same as when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Hmm, but in the data, g2 is 0%, and the double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%. So that fits.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance. So when both are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone.

But then why is the resistance 10% in g1g3? Let's think: in the wild type, G1 and G3 are probably contributing to the resistance. If each contributes, say, 75% and 50%, but that's probably not additive. Hmm, but the percentages aren't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so each contributes a part of the resistance. So without G1, the resistance is 75%, and without G3, 50%. So if both are knocked out, the resistance would be 75% + 50% - 100% (wait, that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps without both, the resistance is additive, but not beyond 100%. So maybe 75 + 50 = 125, but since you can't have more than 100%, the maximum is 100%, so perhaps the double mutant would be 25% (75% + 50% - 100%). But in the data, it's 10% instead. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe there's more going on.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but in a way that they have some overlapping functions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if G2 is epistatic over G1, then knocking out G2 would mask the effect of G1. But in our data, knocking out both G1 and G2 (g1g2) gives 0%, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because without G2, G1 doesn't contribute anything. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, for the g2g3 double mutant: same as g2. So without G2, G3's function doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

So, G2 is a transcription factor, and both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

So, when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to complete susceptibility (0%).

In the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. That's better than g2, so perhaps other genes are contributing. Similarly, g3 is 50% resistance.

In the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%—this is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. Without both, the resistance is much lower.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF upstream of both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, which is the same as knocking out G2 (since without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed), why isn't the resistance 0%? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Because in the double mutant g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is still present. So if G2 is a TF, it's expressing G1 and G3. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2's function is not enough to provide any resistance? That's not making sense. Because in that case, without G1 and G3, but with G2, why isn't resistance normal?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let's think again.

The problem says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are regulated by G2.

So when G2 is present, it's activating G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance. So in g1, you can't make G1 product, but G2 is still working, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance. Similarly, in g3, G2 is working, G1 is expressed, but without G3, resistance is 50%. 

In the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. But since G2 is still present and functional, maybe G2 is activating other genes as well that contribute 10% of the resistance. Or perhaps G2's own function is part of the resistance, so even without G1 and G3, the plant still has some resistance.

Wait, but the g2 mutant is 0%, meaning that without G2, even with G1 and G3, the resistance is gone. So G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 to function.

So, in g1g3, G2 is still present, so G2 is active. But G1 and G3 are knocked out. So perhaps G2 itself has some function beyond just regulating G1 and G3. So, without G1 and G3, but with G2, you get 10% resistance. So G2's own function contributes 10%, and G1 and G3 contribute the rest.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, g2 is 0%. If G1 were the TF, then knocking out G1 would prevent downstream genes from being expressed. But in g1, the resistance is 75%, not 0%, so that doesn't fit. So probably G1 isn't the TF.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulatory region, maybe same regulation), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if they have the same promoter, why are their single mutants different? Well, maybe their individual products contribute differently. But I'm not sure about this.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone, which suggests they are additive, not epistatic. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So in the absence of one, the other can take over. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, which suggests they don't fully compensate. So redundancy might not fit. But also, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1's mutation masks G3's effect. But the data's double mutant g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either single, so they contribute additively, which contradicts epistasis.

Wait, but perhaps if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is upstream, then G1 is epistatic. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the epistatic relationships: when two genes are in the same pathway, the one that's upstream (the TF) is epistatic to the downstream gene.

So if G2 is the TF, it's upstream of G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%—so perhaps each contributes some, and when both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is 10%, which might be the contribution from other genes. So maybe 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) = 125% but capped at 100%, but that doesn't explain 10%. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So without G2, both are knocked out, and resistance is 0%. But when G2 is present, and only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can contribute. So that would fit.

In the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, but G2 is present. So G2 must be doing something else. But why resistance is 10% then? Maybe G2 has a minor role, and other genes contribute 10%.

But the key is to determine the relationships.

Looking again at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10%

This suggests that G2 is the only one whose knockout completely determines the phenotype, and when G2 is present, the other genes (G1 and G3) contribute.

So G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. So in the double mutants with G2 present (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution when both are present.

So G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance but through separate pathways. So they are in parallel pathways, not in series.

In that case, knocking both out would lead to a much lower resistance than either single.

So from this, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, possibly in parallel pathways.

Epistatic relationships: Since G2 is upstream, it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic over both.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout leads to 0%, which would suggest it's the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure about same promoter. Also, G3 epistatic towards G1? But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so probably additive. So B might not be correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means same gene affecting multiple traits—probably not the case here. G1 and G3 are separate genes.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that when one is knocked out, the other can compensate. But in the data, the single mutants have lower resistance than wild type, but not 0. So, if they were redundant, perhaps each alone would not be enough, but together they are. But the data shows that when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is even worse. So maybe they're not fully redundant. Hmm, but if they are redundant, their double mutant's effect would be the same as each single mutant. But in this case, the double mutant is worse, so redundancy might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe their functions are additive. So each contributes some resistance, and together they contribute more. But in the presence of G2, which is a TF, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both targets of G2, and when G2 is active, both are expressed, leading to maximum resistance. Without G2, nothing. But when only one is knocked out, the other can contribute some resistance. So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, each in their own pathways.

In the double mutant g1g3, without both, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single. So, each contributes something, and their combined absence makes it worse.

So, which option matches this?

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking both out would have the same effect as knocking one out. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either, so that's not redundancy. So D might be incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy would mean that a gene affects multiple traits, but here G1 and G3 are separate, so probably not.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but their single mutants have different phenotypes. So maybe this is possible. But why would G3 be epistatic over G1?

Epistatic means that the effect of one masks the other. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, so it's additive, not epistatic.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of a G3 mutation would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which is additive. So perhaps this is not the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about which options are correct based on the data.

The key points from the data:

1. G2 knockout (g2) leads to 0% resistance. So G2 is critical, likely a regulatory gene (like a TF) upstream of others.

2. G1 knockout (g1) leads to 75% resistance. So G1 contributes, but not as much as G2.

3. G3 knockout (g3) leads to 50% resistance. So G3 contributes, but less than G1.

4. Double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have 0% resistance, same as g2. So the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance when G1 or G3 are knocked out.

5. The double mutant g1g3 leads to 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, resistance is worse than either single mutant.

So from this, G2 is the main gene, acting upstream, perhaps a TF.

The interaction between G1 and G3 must be additive. So when both are missing, the resistance is lower than either alone. Hence, they are in separate pathways or contribute in a way that their functions are additive.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that if one is present, the other can compensate. But the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single, so they don't fully compensate. So perhaps they're not redundant. So D might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe gene redundancy isn't the case, but additive. So the correct option would be that G1 and G3 are additive, and G2 is the upstream TF.

Looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but pleiotropy isn't about additive effects. That's about a single gene affecting multiple traits. So probably not.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is the one with 0%, so G1 can't be the TF. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but their single mutants have different effects (75% and 50%). So that's possible—maybe they have the same promoter but different expression levels or other factors.

But what about G3 being epistatic towards G1? If G3 is epistatic, then the g1 mutation would be masked in the presence of G3. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests additive, not epistatic.

Wait, perhaps if G3 is epistatic over G1, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as the more severe single mutant. But in the data, it's worse, so that can't be. So perhaps B is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I need to choose the best fit.

Wait, another approach: which options align with the epistatic relationships.

We have G2 as the TF, so it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, same issue.

Wait, maybe the correct option is C.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy is not about additive effects, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But earlier reasoning suggests that when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the effect is additive, which would be more consistent with them being in parallel pathways rather than redundant. So in that case, the double mutant's resistance would be additive, which is what we see (10% compared to 75% and 50%).

Wait, but wait. If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then their contributions are additive. So without G1, the resistance is 75% (so other pathways contribute 25%); without G3, 50%. So without both, 75% (from G3) +50% (from G1) minus 100% (since that's the maximum) would be 25%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other downstream genes. So when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed, contributing to resistance. When G2 is absent, no G1 or G3 expression, so resistance is 0%.

But when only G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance. When only G3 is knocked out (g3), G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, but why would G3 contribute less than G1? Maybe because G1 is a more effective downstream gene, or perhaps G3 is in a less efficient pathway.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 are present. But since G2 is active, perhaps G2 has some residual function, leading to 10% resistance. So the 10% is from G2's own activity, not from G1 or G3.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Their functions are additive, but they don't compensate for each other.

Looking at the options again, which option aligns with this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if they're redundant, the double mutant should have the same as either single, but the data shows it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy, and the epistatic part doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter could mean they're co-regulated, but the single mutants have different effects. So maybe this is possible. But epistatic part doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is option D, but not because of redundancy. Maybe D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1+G3, but the data shows worse. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Wait, not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of what each option says about the epistatic relationships.

The question is about which conclusion we can draw regarding their interactions.

Another angle: what does the data say about the relationship between G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So each contributes some, and their effects are additive. That suggests that their functions are not redundant and are in separate pathways.

So, G1 and G3 are additive, meaning their functions are not dependent on each other. So when both are missing, the effect is additive.

So which options fit that?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that would mean that their functions are the same, and their combined knockout would not be worse than either single. But in the data, it's worse. So D is probably incorrect.

So, the correct answer must be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, but that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are both targets. So without G2, both are knocked out. But in the presence of G2, each contributes.

But the data shows that the double mutant (g1g3) is worse than either single, implying their functions are additive. So they are in parallel pathways.

So which option says that G1 and G3 are in parallel, additive pathways and G2 is the TF?

Looking back, none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the correct option is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, no, because redundancy would mean their combined knockout doesn't make it worse than either. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look again at each option's specifics.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So if G1 is epistatic over G3, the presence of G1 would mask G3's effect. But in the data, g3 has lower resistance than g1, which suggests that G3 is contributing less than G1.

Wait, perhaps G1 is epistatic over G3, meaning that G3's effect is only seen when G1 is not present. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out at 50%. So that doesn't fit the idea of G1 being epistatic over G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic over G1. Then, if G3 is present, G1's effect is masked. But when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1 would be seen. But in the data, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%, which is the opposite.

I'm getting stuck. Let's approach this with the information that G2 is the TF and the other genes are downstream.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively. So their double knockout would have a more severe phenotype than each single.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy would not lead to additive effects.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because pleiotropy isn't about additive effects.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter, but their single mutants have different effects. So perhaps they are co-regulated but have different functions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but that doesn't align with the data either.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is the worst. The presence of G2 allows some resistance because G2 itself may have a minor role. So perhaps G2 is a TF for other genes besides G1 and G3, which contribute 10% resistance.

So the hierarchy is: G2 (TF) → G1 and G3 → downstream genes → resistance.

In the presence of G2, knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance, but when both are knocked out, only some resistance remains.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, likely in separate pathways.

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy doesn't fit. So this can't be.

So, perhaps the correct option is not listed here, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not seeing why. Let's read it again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, if G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined knockout would be same as either single, but the data shows it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (worse than either single)

This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, G2 is the upstream gene.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, implying that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, each contributes some, and when both are missing, the effect is additive.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, their functions are additive.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, not two genes. So that's probably not correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated. But their single mutants have different effects, which is possible. But why does the double mutant g1g3 have worse resistance?

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single. But it's worse, so that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: let's think which option correctly describes that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 contribute additively.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit the data.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2's single mutant is 0%, so G2 can't be downstream of G1. So G1 can't be the TF.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to pick the best option based on the data.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So their double mutant is worse than either single, indicating additive effects.

Looking at the options, the only option that mentions G2 as the TF is options A, B, C, D.

Now, which option fits the additive effect?

Looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: possible. But G3 is epistatic towards G1 would mean the double mutant g1g3 would have same as G3's single, but data shows worse.

So perhaps this is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because pleiotropy is not additive.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but without seeing it perfectly fit.

Wait, perhaps "show pleiotropy" in option C is a distractor, and the key is that G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit the data. So the correct answer is not C.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which option correctly identifies the epistatic relationships.

We know that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, because in the double mutants, when G2 is present, the effect is worse than when G2 is knocked out.

But no option directly states that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is masked. But the data shows that in the double mutant, the resistance is worse than either, so that's not epistatic.

Hmm. I think I'm out of time and need to make a best guess.

The data indicates G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 contribute additively. Among the options, option D says G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 have gene redundancy. But that doesn't fit. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not completely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, but that's not matching the data.

Wait, another thought: the double mutant of g1g3 has 10% resistance. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%. Which is the same as when only G2 is active. So perhaps G1 and G3 are the only targets of G2, and when both are missing, G2's own function provides minimal resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are the main targets, and their functions are additive.

Looking again, which option aligns with this?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which they don't because the double mutant is worse.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, another possibility: G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, with G1 upstream of G3. So G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option D because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant in that they can compensate for each other, but their combined knockout isn't as bad as expected. But no, the data shows worse.

Hmm...

I think I'm going to have to choose option D. But I'm not confident.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine to determine their roles in anthracnose resistance. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer the genetic relationships, particularly focusing on whether one gene is a transcription factor (TF) and how the genes interact.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild-type but not completely susceptible).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (more susceptible than wild-type but not completely susceptible).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Inferences**:
   - **G2 is critical**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0%) suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.
   - **Additive effects of G1 and G3**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3), indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely through separate pathways.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The resistance levels of g1g2 and g2g3 are identical to g2, meaning G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent with the data, as G2's single mutant (g2) has 0% resistance, indicating G2, not G1, is the TF. Additionally, pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as G2 and G3 do not appear to affect multiple traits in a single gene.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. While G2 being a TF aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Furthermore, G3 being epistatic towards G1 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is not supported here, as G1 and G3 are distinct genes contributing independently to resistance. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 being a TF aligns with the data, gene redundancy is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has additive effects rather than epistasis.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance through separate pathways. However, none of the options perfectly align with the data. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, even though the claims about redundancy and epistasis are not fully consistent with the data.

**Answer: D**
