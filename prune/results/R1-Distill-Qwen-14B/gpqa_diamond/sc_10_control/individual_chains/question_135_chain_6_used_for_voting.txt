Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Oh wait, the equation is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should interpret that more carefully.

Wait, I think that's a typo maybe. Or perhaps it's written as the interaction term. So the interaction is between a boson field X and a fermion ψ_f. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, X is a boson, and it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term involves the fermion fields. So, when X decays, it would produce a pair of fermions.

The options give various possible decay channels. Looking at the options, they list combinations like b bbar, c cbar, etc. So I need to determine which fermion pairs are possible given the mass of X.

The key point is the mass of X. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. For X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the combined mass of the fermion and antifermion must be less than the mass of X.

Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy must be less than the energy of the decaying particle. So for each fermion species, the sum of the rest mass energies of the two must be less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, actually, the condition is that the rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because if the fermion's rest mass is m, then the pair's rest mass is 2m. So 2m ≤ M_X.

So M_X is 6 GeV, so 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion whose rest mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So I need to list all known fermions (quarks and leptons) and their masses to see which satisfy m ≤3 GeV.

Let's list the masses:

Leptons:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: much less than 0.1 GeV, but since they're neutral, but for decay into neutrinos, perhaps the X would decay into ν ν-bar? Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and ψ_f, which I think is a Dirac fermion. So the decay products are a pair of ψ_f particles. So if ψ_f is a charged lepton, like e, mu, tau, or a quark, then the decay would be into that pair.

Wait, the interaction is given by L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, possibly, this is a Yukawa interaction, similar to the Higgs interaction with fermions. So the boson X is interacting with a fermion ψ_f.

So X can decay into two ψ_f particles. So in this case, the possible decay products are ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So for each possible ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f ψ_f-bar.

But the question is about the possible fermions ψ_f that are allowed in the decay, based on their masses.

So any fermion species with mass m where 2m ≤6 GeV can be produced.

So 2m ≤6 ⇒ m ≤3 GeV.

So let's list all fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

First, quarks:

- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV ≈ 0.0022 GeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV ≈ 0.0047 GeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV ≈ 0.1 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, so for quarks, only u, d, s, and c have masses below 3 GeV. Because:

u: 0.0022 <3 → yes.

d: 0.0047 <3 → yes.

s: 0.1 <3 → yes.

c: 1.5 <3 → yes.

b: 4.5 >3 → no. So b quark is too heavy.

Top quark is way too heavy, so no.

So quarks allowed are u, d, s, c.

Now for leptons:

Electron: 0.0005 → yes.

Muon: 0.105 → yes.

Tau: 1.78 → yes.

Neutrinos are almost massless, but their masses are so tiny, but the problem doesn't list neutrinos as options. Looking at the options, the possible decay products include e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, and for quarks, like b, s, etc.

Wait, the options only list some of the possible fermions. So, for each of the possible fermions, their masses must be ≤3 GeV for X to decay into that pair.

So X can decay into pairs of:

- u and u-bar
- d and d-bar
- s and s-bar
- c and c-bar
- e and e-bar
- mu and mu-bar
- tau and tau-bar

Wait, wait, but the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs. Because 3.56 <6.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Its mass is 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Now, wait, but the options list only some of them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

Wait, but b is too heavy. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So B includes c, which is allowed, but no b. So B includes all the allowed except for e, mu, tau. Wait, no, B includes e, mu, tau.

Wait, all the fermions in option B have m ≤3 GeV except... no, all are allowed. Let me check:

c:1.5 → yes.

s:0.1 → yes.

u:0.002 → yes.

d:0.004 → yes.

tau: 1.78 → yes.

mu:0.105 → yes.

e:0.0005 → yes.

So option B includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for the bottom quark, t quark, etc. So option B seems to include all possible allowed decay channels.

Wait, but what about the tau pair? Because 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so it's allowed. So X can decay into tau+ tau−.

Wait, but let's go back. The question is about the interaction Lagrangian given. The interaction is given as L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(v + X(y))ψ_f(y). So ψ_f is a fermion field. So the decay would be X → ψ_f ψ_f-bar.

So in the decay, X must produce a pair of the same fermion, like e+ e−, or mu+ mu−, etc.

So if the interaction is with a particular fermion type, then X can only decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

Wait, but the problem is given as the interaction for a specific ψ_f. So the Lagrangian is for each possible ψ_f? Or is this a general interaction for any fermion?

Wait, no, the Lagrangian is given as a specific interaction, so perhaps the fermion ψ_f is a specific one. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is written as the interaction with a fermion field ψ_f, but the actual fermion could be any possible.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [this Lagrangian]." So X can interact with any fermion via this term, meaning that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the possible decay products are any fermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So considering all possible fermions, as I did earlier, the allowed are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So X can decay into pairs of any of these, as long as each has mass ≤3 GeV.

So now, looking at the options.

Option A includes b, which is 4.5 GeV, so 2*m=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these have masses ≤3 GeV. So possible.

Option C includes t quark, which is way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me recheck.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

But wait, the options don't have all of these. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−

B) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

C) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

D) X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

So option B includes everything except for the b quark and the t quark, which are too heavy.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why is option B the correct one? Because it includes all the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. So the allowed decay channels are all the fermion pairs with mass ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decays are:

c cbar (1.5 GeV each, 3 GeV total, which is allowed),
s sbar (0.1 GeV, 0.2 total),
u ubar (0.002 GeV, 0.004 total),
d dbar (0.0047 GeV, 0.0094),
tau+ tau− (1.78 each, 3.56 total),
mu+ mu− (0.105 each, 0.21 total),
e+ e− (0.0005 each, 0.001 total).

So all of these are allowed. Option B has all of them except only includes the ones where m ≤3 GeV.

So the correct option is B. But wait, does the tau pair have 2m = 3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV? Yes, 3.56 <6, so allowed.

But wait, another point about phase space and coupling. Oh, but the question is about kinematics, not about whether the decay is possible due to other factors like available phase space or coupling strength.

So kinematically allowed means 2m_f ≤ M_X.

So yes, option B is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the total rest mass energy of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). This condition is expressed as \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Therefore, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Identify fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Quarks:
  - \( u \): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( d \): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( s \): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( c \): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
  - \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Leptons:
  - \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Neutrinos: negligible mass (not listed in the options).

From this, the allowed fermions are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
The options list possible decay channels of \( X \). Each option includes specific fermion pairs. To determine the correct answer, we check which options include only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) and exclude those with \( m_f > 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (e.g., \( b, t \)).

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy must be less than the energy of the decaying particle. So for each fermion species, the sum of the rest mass energies of the two must be less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, actually, the condition is that the rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because if the fermion's rest mass is m, then the pair's rest mass is 2m. So 2m ≤ M_X.

So M_X is 6 GeV, so 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion whose rest mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So I need to list all known fermions (quarks and leptons) and their masses to see which satisfy m ≤3 GeV.

Let's list the masses:

Leptons:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: much less than 0.1 GeV, but since they're neutral, but for decay into neutrinos, perhaps the X would decay into ν ν-bar? Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and ψ_f, which I think is a Dirac fermion. So the decay products are a pair of ψ_f particles. So if ψ_f is a charged lepton, like e, mu, tau, or a quark, then the decay would be into that pair.

Wait, the interaction is given by L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, possibly, this is a Yukawa interaction, similar to the Higgs interaction with fermions. So the boson X is interacting with a fermion ψ_f.

So X can decay into two ψ_f particles. So in this case, the possible decay products are ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So for each possible ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f ψ_f-bar.

But the question is about the possible fermions ψ_f that are allowed in the decay, based on their masses.

So any fermion species with mass m where 2m ≤6 GeV can be produced.

So 2m ≤6 ⇒ m ≤3 GeV.

So let's list all fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

First, quarks:

- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV ≈ 0.0022 GeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV ≈ 0.0047 GeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV ≈ 0.1 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, so for quarks, only u, d, s, and c have masses below 3 GeV. Because:

u: 0.0022 <3 → yes.

d: 0.0047 <3 → yes.

s: 0.1 <3 → yes.

c: 1.5 <3 → yes.

b: 4.5 >3 → no. So b quark is too heavy.

Top quark is way too heavy, so no.

So quarks allowed are u, d, s, c.

Now for leptons:

Electron: 0.0005 → yes.

Muon: 0.105 → yes.

Tau: 1.78 → yes.

Neutrinos are almost massless, but their masses are so tiny, but the problem doesn't list neutrinos as options. Looking at the options, the possible decay products include e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, and for quarks, like b, s, etc.

Wait, the options only list some of the possible fermions. So, for each of the possible fermions, their masses must be ≤3 GeV for X to decay into that pair.

So X can decay into pairs of:

- u and u-bar
- d and d-bar
- s and s-bar
- c and c-bar
- e and e-bar
- mu and mu-bar
- tau and tau-bar

Wait, wait, but the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs. Because 3.56 <6.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Its mass is 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Now, wait, but the options list only some of them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

Wait, but b is too heavy. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So B includes c, which is allowed, but no b. So B includes all the allowed except for e, mu, tau. Wait, no, B includes e, mu, tau.

Wait, all the fermions in option B have m ≤3 GeV except... no, all are allowed. Let me check:

c:1.5 → yes.

s:0.1 → yes.

u:0.002 → yes.

d:0.004 → yes.

tau: 1.78 → yes.

mu:0.105 → yes.

e:0.0005 → yes.

So option B includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for the bottom quark, t quark, etc. So option B seems to include all possible allowed decay channels.

Wait, but what about the tau pair? Because 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so it's allowed. So X can decay into tau+ tau−.

Wait, but let's go back. The question is about the interaction Lagrangian given. The interaction is given as L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(v + X(y))ψ_f(y). So ψ_f is a fermion field. So the decay would be X → ψ_f ψ_f-bar.

So in the decay, X must produce a pair of the same fermion, like e+ e−, or mu+ mu−, etc.

So if the interaction is with a particular fermion type, then X can only decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

Wait, but the problem is given as the interaction for a specific ψ_f. So the Lagrangian is for each possible ψ_f? Or is this a general interaction for any fermion?

Wait, no, the Lagrangian is given as a specific interaction, so perhaps the fermion ψ_f is a specific one. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is written as the interaction with a fermion field ψ_f, but the actual fermion could be any possible.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [this Lagrangian]." So X can interact with any fermion via this term, meaning that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the possible decay products are any fermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So considering all possible fermions, as I did earlier, the allowed are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So X can decay into pairs of any of these, as long as each has mass ≤3 GeV.

So now, looking at the options.

Option A includes b, which is 4.5 GeV, so 2*m=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these have masses ≤3 GeV. So possible.

Option C includes t quark, which is way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me recheck.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

But wait, the options don't have all of these. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−

B) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

C) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

D) X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−

So option B includes everything except for the b quark and the t quark, which are too heavy.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why is option B the correct one? Because it includes all the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. So the allowed decay channels are all the fermion pairs with mass ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decays are:

c cbar (1.5 GeV each, 3 GeV total, which is allowed),
s sbar (0.1 GeV, 0.2 total),
u ubar (0.002 GeV, 0.004 total),
d dbar (0.0047 GeV, 0.0094),
tau+ tau− (1.78 each, 3.56 total),
mu+ mu− (0.105 each, 0.21 total),
e+ e− (0.0005 each, 0.001 total).

So all of these are allowed. Option B has all of them except only includes the ones where m ≤3 GeV.

So the correct option is B. But wait, does the tau pair have 2m = 3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV? Yes, 3.56 <6, so allowed.

But wait, another point about phase space and coupling. Oh, but the question is about kinematics, not about whether the decay is possible due to other factors like available phase space or coupling strength.

So kinematically allowed means 2m_f ≤ M_X.

So yes, option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the total rest mass energy of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). This condition is expressed as \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Therefore, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Identify fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Quarks:
  - \( u \): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( d \): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( s \): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( c \): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
  - \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Leptons:
  - \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Neutrinos: negligible mass (not listed in the options).

From this, the allowed fermions are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
The options list possible decay channels of \( X \). Each option includes specific fermion pairs. To determine the correct answer, we check which options include only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) and exclude those with \( m_f > 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (e.g., \( b, t \)).

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
