Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is a dialogue between a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain. The RNP says, "Oh, I know you." The chain replies that it's time to say goodbye because it needs to be on its way. The question is where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?

Hmm. I remember that ribonucleoproteins are involved in various cellular processes. One of the main RNP particles I can think of is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which is involved in protein synthesis. Oh wait, the SRP binds to the ribosome during translation when a signal sequence is exposed on the nascent peptide chain. That's right.

So when the SRP meets the ribosome, the nascent chain is being synthesized on the ribosome. The SRP recognizes this chain, probably because it's a signal peptide, and then helps the ribosome move to the rough ER. So in this scenario, the RNP is the SRP, and the nascent chain is being sent to the rough ER.

But the question says the RNP tells the chain to "pause there for a minute" and that the chain is heading somewhere else. So the meeting point is likely the ribosome, and the chain is moving to the ER.

Wait, looking at the options, option B says from the ribosome to the proteasome. But the proteasome is involved in protein degradation, and I don't think the chain here is being degraded. Option A is cytosol to extracellular, which might be after the ER, Golgi, etc. Option C is membrane to nucleus, which doesn't seem right here. Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion. Hmm.

Wait, the chain is a nascent protein. If the RNP is SRP, the meeting is at the ribosome. The SRP brings the ribosome to the ER membrane. So the chain would then go into the ER. But the options don't mention the ER.

Wait the options: B is ribosome to proteasome. But the SRP and signal peptide usually target for the ER, not the proteasome. Oh wait, if the chain doesn't have a signal peptide, it might be targeted elsewhere, or if it's being marked for degradation, then it would go to the proteasome.

Wait, the dialogue: the RNP says, "I know you," suggesting it's been through this before. The chain says it's time to say goodbye, implying it's leaving the current place.

So when the SRP meets the ribosome, the ribosome is in the cytosol (or attached to the ER, but usually free in the cytosol when the SRP is bound). The SRP helps the ribosome attach to the ER, so the meeting is in the cytosol (or on the ribosome in the cytosol). So the chain is heading to the ER.

But looking back at the options, none of them directly say ribosome to ER. Let me check the options again.

Option A: cytosol to extracellular. That's probably after the Golgi. The chain would go from the ER to Golgi, then secreted out. So not this.

Option B: ribosome to proteasome. Proteasome is involved in breaking down proteins. But the chain is a nascent chain, so if it's being sent to the proteasome, maybe it's misfolded or something. But the SRP is for correct targeting. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: membrane to nucleus. Doesn't fit the scenario.

Option D: Golgi to mitochondrion. Doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the RNP is something else. Another RNP is the mRNA, but no, that's not a particle. Or, maybe it's the spliceosome, but that's involved in RNA splicing, not protein synthesis.

Another possibility: The RNP is the ribosome itself. But the question says the RNP says "I know you," which suggests it's a separate particle.

Wait, the SRP is a ribonucleoprotein. So when the SRP binds to the ribosome, the meeting is at the ribosome. So the chain is on the ribosome, and after the meeting, the chain goes to the ER.

But the options don't have ribosome to ER. Let me look again.

Option B is ribosome to proteasome. That would indicate the chain is going to be degraded. So why would the RNP (like SRP) send the chain to the proteasome? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the nascent chain is being synthesized on a ribosome, doesn't have a signal sequence, so the SRP doesn't recognize it, and the chain might be retained in the cytosol or sent to the proteasome if it's misfolded.

Wait, but the question says "I know you," suggesting a previous interaction. So the RNP is the SRP, which recognizes the signal peptide, and the chain is directed to the ER. So the meeting is at the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER (which is not an option). But looking at the options, maybe the chain is not going directly to the ER but to another location.

Wait, the options don't have ER. Let me think about another possibility. Another RNP is involved in mRNA transport, but that's for moving mRNA from nucleus to cytosol, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, going back to the conversation. The RNP says, "Let me show you in; you really need some sugar." Hmm, "sugar" — that's a clue. Oh, I remember that the addition of sugars (glycosylation) occurs in the ER and Golgi. So the chain is going to a place where it'll get glycosylated.

So the RNP is SRP, meeting the chain on the ribosome. The chain is then sent to the ER, where glycosylation occurs. But the options don't include ER. So the meeting is at the ribosome, and the chain is heading to the ER, but the options don't have that.

Wait the options are A) cytosol to extracellular, B) ribosome to proteasome, C) membrane to nucleus, D) Golgi to mitochondrion.

Hmm. Another angle: The RNP is the SRP, so the meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol. The chain is being sent to the ER, which is a membrane-bound organelle. But none of the options directly say that.

Wait, perhaps the chain is being synthesized on the ribosome, the SRP brings it to the ER, and then after the ER, the chain goes to the Golgi. But the question is about the first transfer.

Alternatively, the chain is a nascent chain that has just been synthesized on the ribosome. The RNP is the SRP, so they meet on the ribosome in the cytosol. The chain is then bound to the SRP and moved to the ER. So the meeting is in the cytosol (the ribosome is in the cytosol when the SRP is attached, before it's anchored to the ER). So the meeting location is the cytosol, and the destination is the ER, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are: A is cytosol to extracellular, which would be after the ER and Golgi. B is ribosome to proteasome, which doesn't fit the scenario. C is membrane (maybe ER) to nucleus, which doesn't make sense. D is Golgi to mitochondrion, which is also not right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the process again. The process is: the nascent chain is being made on the ribosome. The SRP (RNP) recognizes the signal sequence and binds. The ribosome then docks at the ER, and the chain continues to be inserted into the ER membrane. So the meeting is on the ribosome (in the cytosol), and the destination is the ER.

But looking at the options, option B is from the ribosome to the proteasome, which is degradation. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the correct option isn't directly listed, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: The RNP could be the termination factor or something else. Alternatively, the chain is a transfer RNA, but that doesn't fit the description of a nascent chain.

Wait, the chain is a nascent peptide chain, so it's a protein being synthesized. The RNP is the SRP. So the meeting is on the ribosome (in the cytosol), and the chain is heading to the ER.

Looking back at the options, none of the options directly mention the ER, but option A is cytosol to extracellular. That could be after the chain has gone through ER and Golgi. But the question is where did they meet, and where is the chain heading.

So the meeting is at the ribosome, which is in the cytosol. So the chain is moving from the ribosome (in the cytosol) to the ER, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the meeting is in the ER membrane. No, the RNP (SRP) and ribosome meet in the cytosol before the ribosome attaches to the ER.

Hmm... Maybe the confusion is because the question doesn't directly match any of the options. But looking again, the options are:

A) cytosol to extracellular space – this would be after the Golgi.

B) ribosome to proteasome – perhaps if the chain is being recognized as incorrect.

C) membrane to nucleus – no.

D) Golgi to mitochondrion – no.

Wait, another angle: the RNP could be something else. For example, the termination factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about the process of a protein being targeted to the mitochondria or nucleus. But the RNP here is likely the SRP.

Wait, another thought: The chain is a nascent chain on the ribosome. The SRP binds, and the ribosome is directed to the ER. So the chain is now entering the ER. But the question is where did they meet, and where is the chain heading.

So the meeting is on the ribosome (in the cytosol), and the chain is heading to the ER. But the options don't have ribosome to ER. So perhaps the intended answer is that the meeting is at the ribosome, and the chain is going to the ER, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: "sugar" suggests glycosylation, which occurs in the ER and Golgi. So the chain is going to the ER. So the meeting is at the ribosome (in the cytosol), and the chain is going to the ER (which is a membrane-bound structure, but the options don't have that).

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is ribosome to proteasome. That doesn't fit. Option A is cytosol to extracellular, which is the end point after ER and Golgi, but the question is where they meet and where the chain is heading.

So if the RNP is the SRP, the meeting is in the cytosol (at the ribosome), and the chain is heading to the ER. But no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the signal peptide's cleavage. After the chain is in the ER, the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase. But that's after the RNP has already done its job.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being sent to the proteasome for degradation, but that would mean the RNP is not SRP but something else.

Wait, another RNP is the ubiquitin ligase, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being synthesized on a ribosome attached to the ER (so the meeting is on the ER membrane), but that doesn't fit the question's context.

This is confusing. Let me try to think of each option.

Option B: ribosome to proteasome. So the chain is being sent to the proteasome. When is that done? Usually, when the protein is misfolded. But the RNP here is the SRP, which is for correct targeting. So why would the SRP send it to the proteasome? That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the RNP is a different one. Maybe another RNP involved in directing proteins to other places, but I can't think of any.

Wait, the question says the RNP says, "I know you," implying a previous interaction. So maybe it's a different RNP. Let's think about the spliceosome; but that's during RNA processing, not protein.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ribosome itself, but the question says the RNP is talking.

Wait, perhaps the chain is a transfer RNA, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the chain is a nascent RNA, but the question says a nascent chain, which implies protein.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: from ribosome to proteasome. If the chain is being directed to the proteasome, that would be for degradation. But why would the RNP (like SRP) do that? That doesn't make sense. Unless the chain is not correctly targeted. But the RNP is supposed to help with correct targeting.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being synthesized on the ribosome and then sent directly to the proteasome if it doesn't have a signal sequence. But the RNP in that case would be a different one.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about other possible RNP particles. There's the RNase P, which is an RNP involved in processing tRNA, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: the chain is a nascent chain, and the RNP is the termination factor. No, that doesn't involve the ER.

Alternatively, the RNP is the termination release factor, but the question is about where the chain is heading.

I think the intended answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

If the RNP is the SRP, the meeting is at the ribosome (in the cytosol), and the chain is heading to the ER. The options don't directly give this, but option A is cytosol to extracellular, which is the end point after ER and Golgi. Option B is ribosome to proteasome, which is degradation. The question's dialogue doesn't suggest degradation, but rather moving on.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The chain says, "It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way." So the chain is leaving the current location. So if the meeting is on the ribosome (in the cytosol), the chain is going to the ER, which is a membrane-bound organelle in the cell. So the destination isn't the extracellular space yet.

Looking at the options, the only one that starts at the ribosome is option B. But where is the proteasome? It's in the cytosol as well. So if the meeting is at the ribosome, and the chain is going to the proteasome, that would be within the cytosol.

But why would the chain go to the proteasome? That's for proteins that are misfolded or tagged for degradation. The RNP (SRP) is supposed to help with correct targeting.

Wait, maybe the chain is a ubiquitinated protein waiting to be degraded. But the SRP wouldn't be involved in that.

Hmm. Another angle: The chain is a nascent chain that doesn't have a signal peptide, so the SRP doesn't bind, and it's left in the cytosol. But the question says the RNP knows the chain, implying SRP does bind.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is probably B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I think the correct process is that the chain goes to the ER.

Wait, but none of the options include the ER. Let me think again.

Oh! Wait, the chain is a nascent chain on the ribosome. The RNP is the SRP. The SRP brings the ribosome to the ER, so the chain is heading to the ER. The meeting is in the cytosol (since the ribosome is there before docking at the ER). So the chain is moving from the cytosol (on the ribosome) to the ER.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is A, which is cytosol to extracellular. But that's not correct because the ER is next, not extracellular.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the chain being secreted out, but that's after the ER and Golgi.

Wait, another thought: The Golgi apparatus is where the chain might be further modified, and then sent to the extracellular space. But the initial meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol.

So the options don't directly capture the initial transfer to the ER, but perhaps the intended answer is A, suggesting the chain is moving from the cytosol (where it's synthesized) to the extracellular space, but that skips the ER and Golgi steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit misleading, and the correct option is A.

No, I think I need to go with the process. The chain is on the ribosome, the RNP is SRP, so the chain is heading to the ER. But the options don't have that. So maybe the intended answer is B, because the RNP is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the proteasome, but that doesn't fit the scenario.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh! Wait, when the SRP brings the ribosome to the ER, the chain is inserted into the ER membrane. Once the chain is in the ER, the SRP is released and returns to the cytosol. So the meeting is at the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the ER.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps I should choose the closest option. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the RNP is the termination factor, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is a transfer from the ribosome to the proteasome for degradation. But that would require the RNP to be something else, like a ubiquitin ligase.

Hmm. I'm stuck between options A and B. But I think the correct process is that the chain is moving from the ribosome (in the cytosol) to the ER, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another possibility: after the chain is synthesized, if it doesn't have a signal peptide, it remains in the cytosol. But the RNP (SRP) wouldn't recognize it, so that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is a nascent chain that's being targeted to the mitochondrion, but I don't think there's an RNP involved in that process. Mitochondria import proteins from the cytosol, but the targeting is via specific signals, not an RNP like SRP.

I'm so confused. Maybe the answer is option B, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a dialogue between a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle and a nascent chain, where the RNP recognizes the chain and directs it to a new location. The key is to identify where they meet and where the chain is heading.

The RNP in question is likely the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds to nascent chains with a signal peptide during translation on the ribosome. This interaction occurs in the cytosol, where the ribosome is free before docking at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The SRP helps the ribosome attach to the ER, allowing the nascent chain to be translocated into the ER for further processing, such as glycosylation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (cytosol to extracellular space):** This describes the final destination of a secreted protein after passing through the ER and Golgi. However, the question focuses on the initial meeting and the chain's immediate destination, not the extracellular space.

- **Option B (ribosome to proteasome):** This suggests the chain is being targeted for degradation. However, the SRP is involved in directing correctly targeted proteins, not misfolded ones, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (membrane to nucleus):** This does not align with the role of the SRP or the described scenario.

- **Option D (Golgi to mitochondrion):** This is incorrect, as the chain's journey does not involve the Golgi or mitochondrion at this stage.

The meeting occurs at the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the ER. However, none of the options explicitly state this. Among the given options, **Option B** (ribosome to proteasome) is the closest match, but it contradicts the typical role of the SRP. Despite this inconsistency, **Option B** is the most fitting choice based on the options provided.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is a dialogue between a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain. The RNP says, "Oh, I know you." The chain replies that it's time to say goodbye because it needs to be on its way. The question is where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The chain says, "It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way." So the chain is leaving the current location. So if the meeting is on the ribosome (in the cytosol), the chain is going to the ER, which is a membrane-bound organelle in the cell. So the destination isn't the extracellular space yet.

Looking at the options, the only one that starts at the ribosome is option B. But where is the proteasome? It's in the cytosol as well. So if the meeting is at the ribosome, and the chain is going to the proteasome, that would be within the cytosol.

But why would the chain go to the proteasome? That's for proteins that are misfolded or tagged for degradation. The RNP (SRP) is supposed to help with correct targeting.

Wait, maybe the chain is a ubiquitinated protein waiting to be degraded. But the SRP wouldn't be involved in that.

Hmm. Another angle: The chain is a nascent chain that doesn't have a signal peptide, so the SRP doesn't bind, and it's left in the cytosol. But the question says the RNP knows the chain, implying SRP does bind.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is probably B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I think the correct process is that the chain goes to the ER.

Wait, but none of the options include the ER. Let me think again.

Oh! Wait, the chain is a nascent chain on the ribosome. The RNP is the SRP. The SRP brings the ribosome to the ER, so the chain is heading to the ER. The meeting is in the cytosol (since the ribosome is there before docking at the ER). So the chain is moving from the cytosol (on the ribosome) to the ER.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is A, which is cytosol to extracellular. But that's not correct because the ER is next, not extracellular.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the chain being secreted out, but that's after the ER and Golgi.

Wait, another thought: The Golgi apparatus is where the chain might be further modified, and then sent to the extracellular space. But the initial meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol.

So the options don't directly capture the initial transfer to the ER, but perhaps the intended answer is A, suggesting the chain is moving from the cytosol (where it's synthesized) to the extracellular space, but that skips the ER and Golgi steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit misleading, and the correct option is A.

No, I think I need to go with the process. The chain is on the ribosome, the RNP is SRP, so the chain is heading to the ER. But the options don't have that. So maybe the intended answer is B, because the RNP is on the ribosome, and the chain is going to the proteasome, but that doesn't fit the scenario.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh! Wait, when the SRP brings the ribosome to the ER, the chain is inserted into the ER membrane. Once the chain is in the ER, the SRP is released and returns to the cytosol. So the meeting is at the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the ER.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps I should choose the closest option. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the RNP is the termination factor, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is a transfer from the ribosome to the proteasome for degradation. But that would require the RNP to be something else, like a ubiquitin ligase.

Hmm. I'm stuck between options A and B. But I think the correct process is that the chain is moving from the ribosome (in the cytosol) to the ER, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another possibility: after the chain is synthesized, if it doesn't have a signal peptide, it remains in the cytosol. But the RNP (SRP) wouldn't recognize it, so that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is a nascent chain that's being targeted to the mitochondrion, but I don't think there's an RNP involved in that process. Mitochondria import proteins from the cytosol, but the targeting is via specific signals, not an RNP like SRP.

I'm so confused. Maybe the answer is option B, but I'm not sure.


The question involves a dialogue between a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle and a nascent chain, where the RNP recognizes the chain and directs it to a new location. The key is to identify where they meet and where the chain is heading.

The RNP in question is likely the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds to nascent chains with a signal peptide during translation on the ribosome. This interaction occurs in the cytosol, where the ribosome is free before docking at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The SRP helps the ribosome attach to the ER, allowing the nascent chain to be translocated into the ER for further processing, such as glycosylation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (cytosol to extracellular space):** This describes the final destination of a secreted protein after passing through the ER and Golgi. However, the question focuses on the initial meeting and the chain's immediate destination, not the extracellular space.

- **Option B (ribosome to proteasome):** This suggests the chain is being targeted for degradation. However, the SRP is involved in directing correctly targeted proteins, not misfolded ones, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (membrane to nucleus):** This does not align with the role of the SRP or the described scenario.

- **Option D (Golgi to mitochondrion):** This is incorrect, as the chain's journey does not involve the Golgi or mitochondrion at this stage.

The meeting occurs at the ribosome in the cytosol, and the chain is heading to the ER. However, none of the options explicitly state this. Among the given options, **Option B** (ribosome to proteasome) is the closest match, but it contradicts the typical role of the SRP. Despite this inconsistency, **Option B** is the most fitting choice based on the options provided.

Answer: B
