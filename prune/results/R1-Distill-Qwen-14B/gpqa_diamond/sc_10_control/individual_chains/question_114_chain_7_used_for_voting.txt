Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the problem says.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, like NaCN, what usually happens? Oh wait, wait. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a nucleophile. In the presence of a ketone, I think it's a substitution reaction, perhaps the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide to form a compound where the carbonyl group is replaced by a hydroxyl and a cyano group.

So, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But wait, what reagent A is needed here? Because I remember that the addition of a cyanide to a ketone usually requires a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the mechanism typically involves the acid protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the cyanide ion can attack.

So for the first part, A must be an acid, probably H3O+ or something similar. Looking at the options, all options have either H3O+ or NaHSO3 for A. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3- ions. But that's more commonly used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the sulfite ester formation or in some other reactions.

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, it's typically done with an acid. Let me think: when you mix a ketone with NaCN and an acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+ (which is the same as H+ in solution), you get the cyanohydrin. So in the first reaction, reagent A is likely H3O+.

Then, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So that would mean the first step doesn't require NaHSO3 but a proton source.

So the first part is probably A = H3O+. So in the options, either A or B is possible for the first part.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. Reagent B is given as H2O. Wait, no. The second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. Wait, no, looking again: the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The reagent is B, and it's H2O. Or wait, no: the problem says "+ B (H2O)" meaning that B is H2O. Wait, wait, no, the way it's written is that in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. Or perhaps B is an acid in aqueous solution. Let me read the problem again.

Reaction two: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give the acid. Wait, the way it's written is a bit unclear. Maybe it's that reagent B is something else, and the reaction is done in H2O. Or perhaps B is an acid catalyst in H2O.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So what's the reaction that converts a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid? I think that involves hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to give carboxylic acids or amides, depending on the conditions.

But in this case, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (with a substituent). So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). That would require hydrolysis of the nitrile.

How does nitrile hydrolysis work? Under acidic conditions, a nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions are using H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl or H3O+.

Wait, but sometimes you need heat as well. For example, HCN addition followed by acid workup, but for nitrile hydrolysis, it's usually H2O with acid and sometimes heat.

So in the second reaction, the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the reagent B must be a strong acid, like HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options, for B, the options are either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Option A: B is HCl.

Option B: B is CH3COOH.

Option C: B is HCl.

Option D: B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but the initial reaction is done with H3O+ as A, so looking at options A and B for the first part. So if A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible.

For the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O with something. Wait, no: the reaction is done with B, and the solvent is H2O?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The way it's written: the second reaction is with reagent B in H2O. Or perhaps the reagent is B, which is H2O and another component. Hmm, the way the question is written is confusing.

Wait, the reaction is: the nitrile compound reacts with B (H2O) → the acid. So perhaps the reagent is B, which is H2O. But that doesn't make sense because H2O alone wouldn't do much without a catalyst.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The problem says "reagent B (H2O)"? That might mean that the reaction is done under aqueous conditions, perhaps with an acid or base.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is H2O with an acid or base. So for the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. That typically requires strong acidic conditions, like HCl in water, or perhaps H3O+ in aqueous solution.

Wait, the second reaction's product is a carboxylic acid. So if the nitrile is in a solution with H2O and an acid, like HCl, that would protonate the nitrile, facilitating the addition of water.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic conditions with H2O. For example, using a concentrated acid like HCl. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed to form the acid.

Looking back at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl. But wait, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first reaction A is H3O+, so option A and B are possible.

Wait, let me think again about the hydrolysis of nitriles. Under strong acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids when heated. The typical reagents are concentrated HCl with heat. So if the second reagent is HCl, that would make sense.

So, in the second reaction, B is HCl, which is an acid catalyst in H2O. So the correct B is HCl.

So, looking at the options, for B, which is HCl, options A and C have B as HCl. But option A's A is H3O+, which is correct for the first reaction. Option C's A is NaHSO3. Hmm, but why would NaHSO3 be used?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What reactions use that? I remember that in some cases, bisulfite is used to reduce ketones to alcohols. Like in the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses H2SO4 and HgSO4. Alternatively, bisulfite can be used to form bisulfite adducts with carbonyl groups, which can then be worked up to give diols, but that's more for ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a cyanohydrin. So the first step needs an acid catalyst, H3O+.

So that would mean reagent A is H3O+. So options A and B are possible for A.

Then, for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. So option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. That would fit both reactions.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as catalyst. The second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst in water. So the reagents would be A = H3O+, B = HCl. So option A is correct.

But wait, another possibility: what if the first reaction uses NaHSO3? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (it's a strong acid) and bisulfite ions. Hmm, but why would that be used in the formation of a cyanohydrin? I don't recall that. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is an example of the Henry reaction, but no, the Henry reaction is for the addition of a nitro compound to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of something else.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the first reaction is not a cyanohydrin but a different product. Let me re-examine the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CN-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So the product of adding NaCN would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product in question is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait, but the butanenitrile would have four carbons. So the nitrile is at the end. So the molecule would be CH2CH2CH(OH)(CH3)CN? No, wait, maybe:

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. Wait, no, but butanenitrile would have four carbons with the nitrile at the end. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CN)-CH(CH3)-OH? Not sure, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. But that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, depending on the numbering.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN in acid, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, not butanenitrile. Because butanenitrile would have four carbons, but this product has three carbons in the cyanohydrin.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, meaning that the nitrile is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain, but that doesn't make sense because butan-2-one is a three-carbon ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Oh wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So when it reacts with NaCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the question says the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So perhaps the starting material is different, but I think I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, for the first reaction, the reagent is an acid, so A is H3O+.

So looking back, the options for A are H3O+ in options A and B, and NaHSO3 in C and D.

So for the first reaction, correct A is H3O+.

Second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid under hydrolysis. So reagent B is HCl. Which options have B as HCl? Options A and C.

But option A has A=H3O+, which is correct for the first reaction. So option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but the second reaction is done with reagent B, which might be HCl (as an acid). So that aligns with option A.

Alternatively, if the second reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, but the options only have HCl as B in some cases.

Hmm, but perhaps the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent. So the correct option would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A= H3O+, B= HCl. Option C is A= NaHSO3, B= HCl. So if the first reaction needed H3O+, option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about NaHSO3. What if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of H+? Because NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-.

HSO3^- is a weak acid, but in strong acidic conditions, it can act as a source of H+. So could NaHSO3 serve as the acid catalyst in the first reaction?

In the cyanohydrin formation, any acid catalyst would work, like H2SO4, HCl, H3O+ (which is H+ in solution), or even HSO3^- from NaHSO3.

So perhaps the first reaction could use either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as the acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is a strong enough acid for that reaction. H3O+ is a stronger acid. But in the presence of NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, would it still protonate the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, NaHSO3 is used. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols via the hydroxymethylation reaction, but that's using formaldehyde and NaHSO3.

Wait, perhaps not. So I'm a bit stuck on whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3.

But given that the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the attack of CN- on the carbonyl, and that requires protonation of the carbonyl, any acid would work, but the common ones are strong acids like H2SO4 or H3O+.

Therefore, the first reaction probably uses H3O+ as the acid, so option A or B.

Since the second reaction uses HCl (as B), which is in option A and C, but A's A is H3O+.

So the correct option is A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Option B: A= H3O+, B= CH3COOH.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH.

So if the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second uses HCl, then option A is correct.

But wait, in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group undergoes hydrolysis. So the reagent is HCl in water. So that makes sense.

Yes, I think option A is correct: A is H3O+ (for the first reaction) and B is HCl (for the second).

The problem involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, which requires an acid catalyst. The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Reactions:
1. **First Reaction**:  
   Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Cyanohydrin formation requires protonation of the carbonyl group to make it more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. Common acid catalysts include H₃O⁺ or H₂SO₄. Based on the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable choice for reagent A.

2. **Second Reaction**:  
   The nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in water. Among the options, HCl is the most appropriate choice for reagent B.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation, as it is less effective than H₃O⁺.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the problem says.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. Reagent B is given as H2O. Wait, no. The second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. Wait, no, looking again: the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as catalyst. The second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst in water. So the reagents would be A = H3O+, B = HCl. So option A is correct.

But wait, another possibility: what if the first reaction uses NaHSO3? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (it's a strong acid) and bisulfite ions. Hmm, but why would that be used in the formation of a cyanohydrin? I don't recall that. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is an example of the Henry reaction, but no, the Henry reaction is for the addition of a nitro compound to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of something else.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the first reaction is not a cyanohydrin but a different product. Let me re-examine the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CN-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So the product of adding NaCN would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product in question is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait, but the butanenitrile would have four carbons. So the nitrile is at the end. So the molecule would be CH2CH2CH(OH)(CH3)CN? No, wait, maybe:

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. Wait, no, but butanenitrile would have four carbons with the nitrile at the end. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CN)-CH(CH3)-OH? Not sure, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. But that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, depending on the numbering.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN in acid, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, not butanenitrile. Because butanenitrile would have four carbons, but this product has three carbons in the cyanohydrin.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, meaning that the nitrile is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain, but that doesn't make sense because butan-2-one is a three-carbon ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Oh wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So when it reacts with NaCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the question says the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So perhaps the starting material is different, but I think I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, for the first reaction, the reagent is an acid, so A is H3O+.

So looking back, the options for A are H3O+ in options A and B, and NaHSO3 in C and D.

So for the first reaction, correct A is H3O+.

Second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid under hydrolysis. So reagent B is HCl. Which options have B as HCl? Options A and C.

But option A has A=H3O+, which is correct for the first reaction. So option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but the second reaction is done with reagent B, which might be HCl (as an acid). So that aligns with option A.

Alternatively, if the second reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, but the options only have HCl as B in some cases.

Hmm, but perhaps the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent. So the correct option would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A= H3O+, B= HCl. Option C is A= NaHSO3, B= HCl. So if the first reaction needed H3O+, option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about NaHSO3. What if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of H+? Because NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-.

HSO3^- is a weak acid, but in strong acidic conditions, it can act as a source of H+. So could NaHSO3 serve as the acid catalyst in the first reaction?

In the cyanohydrin formation, any acid catalyst would work, like H2SO4, HCl, H3O+ (which is H+ in solution), or even HSO3^- from NaHSO3.

So perhaps the first reaction could use either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as the acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is a strong enough acid for that reaction. H3O+ is a stronger acid. But in the presence of NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, would it still protonate the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, NaHSO3 is used. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols via the hydroxymethylation reaction, but that's using formaldehyde and NaHSO3.

Wait, perhaps not. So I'm a bit stuck on whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3.

But given that the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the attack of CN- on the carbonyl, and that requires protonation of the carbonyl, any acid would work, but the common ones are strong acids like H2SO4 or H3O+.

Therefore, the first reaction probably uses H3O+ as the acid, so option A or B.

Since the second reaction uses HCl (as B), which is in option A and C, but A's A is H3O+.

So the correct option is A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Option B: A= H3O+, B= CH3COOH.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH.

So if the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second uses HCl, then option A is correct.

But wait, in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group undergoes hydrolysis. So the reagent is HCl in water. So that makes sense.

Yes, I think option A is correct: A is H3O+ (for the first reaction) and B is HCl (for the second).


The problem involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, which requires an acid catalyst. The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Reactions:
1. **First Reaction**:  
   Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Cyanohydrin formation requires protonation of the carbonyl group to make it more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. Common acid catalysts include H₃O⁺ or H₂SO₄. Based on the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable choice for reagent A.

2. **Second Reaction**:  
   The nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in water. Among the options, HCl is the most appropriate choice for reagent B.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation, as it is less effective than H₃O⁺.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
