Okay, so Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, right? The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. That's like a really good vacuum because lower pressure means fewer gas molecules. The idea is to have as few gas particles as possible so that the electron beam doesn't get scattered too much, which would reduce image quality.

But even after creating this ultra-high vacuum, some gas molecules are still there, as detected by the mass spectrometer. So Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember that mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. But wait, pressure here is really low because it's a vacuum, so λ should be large.

When Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature remains the same, so T hasn't changed. Why would λ change then?

Hmm, the mean free path in gases depends on the average speed of the gas molecules and the rate at which they collide. Oh wait, in the presence of an electron beam, the electrons are moving really fast. The electrons might be interacting with the gas molecules. But wait, the gas molecules are still moving at their thermal speeds, right? Or does the electron beam affect their motion?

Wait, another thought. The electron beam is introducing a lot of energy into the system. The electrons are high-energy, which could cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even get knocked out of the vacuum. But the question says that the mean free path changes, so perhaps the effective pressure is changing.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to interact with the electrons, leading to more scattering. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Wait, mean free path is calculated based on molecular collisions with each other as well as with other objects. In this case, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to collide with the electrons. So the mean free path would be determined by the collisions between gas molecules and the electrons.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is usually considered as the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. If there's another type of interaction, like scattering off electrons, would that affect the mean free path? Or does the mean free path in this context refer to the electron's scattering, not the gas molecules' movement?

Wait, no. Mike was measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules. Wait, but the electron beam is what's being scattered. Oh, wait, no. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says: "the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules, λ, depends on the pressure and the molecular diameter. If the temperature is the same, and the pressure (from the vacuum) is the same, then λ should remain the same as λ1. But in reality, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the pressure isn't the same because the beam is creating more ionization or something, changing the pressure.

Wait, but the mass spectrometer probably still detects the same number of gas molecules because the vacuum pumps are probably still working. Or maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in a way that changes the effective pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to more collisions between the gas molecules and the electrons, which could effectively reduce the mean free path for the gas molecules because they're now colliding with something else besides each other.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are colliding with the electron beam, that would be like increasing the effective collision rate, right? Because each gas molecule would have more things to collide with—like the electrons. So the mean free path would be shorter because they're colliding more frequently.

Wait, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the diameter, but also depends on the speed of the molecules. But if the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other but also with electrons, that would effectively make the collision rate higher. So the mean free path would decrease, because the molecules are colliding more often. Thus, λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = (1)/(n * σ * √2), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section. If the gas molecules are now colliding with electrons, which have a different cross-section, perhaps a larger one, that could increase the collision rate. So the effective n (number of targets) increases. Alternatively, if the electron beam has a high density, the gas molecules might collide more with electrons than with each other.

Wait, but the number density n is fixed because the pressure is fixed. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons have a high current density. So the gas molecules might have a higher chance of colliding with the electrons, which are much lighter and faster.

So the mean free path for the gas molecules would decrease because they're colliding more frequently with the electrons. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That would make sense. So the correct answer should be C.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. To minimize electron scattering and improve imaging, he creates an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment (< 10^-9 Torr). Despite this, some gas molecules remain, and Mike calculates their mean free path as λ1 based on factors like pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter.

When the electron beam is initiated, Mike observes that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature remains constant. The mean free path, λ, is typically determined by the number density of gas molecules, their collision cross-section, and their average speed. Since the temperature and pressure are constant, the molecular motion alone should not alter λ. However, the electron beam introduces additional interactions. The high-energy electrons likely increase the effective collision rate by providing more targets for gas molecules to collide with, effectively reducing the mean free path.

This reduction in mean free path occurs because the gas molecules now experience more frequent collisions not only with each other but also with the electrons. As a result, the mean free path λ2 becomes shorter than the original λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
