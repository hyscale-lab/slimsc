Okay, so I've got this question about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and it's along the z-axis. The question is about the radiated power in the radiation zone, specifically the function f which depends on lambda and theta. The max power is A, and I need to find what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also the form of f. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation has certain patterns depending on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is a spheroid along the z-axis, it probably has rotational symmetry around z. So the radiation pattern would depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is a maximum at theta = 90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis. But this is a spheroid, which is more like an oscillating dipole but maybe with higher multipoles involved. Or wait, perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states it's an oscillating charge distribution. So maybe it's a dipole? Because a dipole is a simple oscillating charge distribution. Oh, but it's spheroidal, so perhaps it's a dipole moment oscillating in a particular way.

In the radiation zone, the fields fall off as 1/r, and the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge, I think. Oh wait, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is given by the Larmor formula. The power is ( (e^2 a^2 )/( 6πε0 c^3 )) or something like that. But for oscillating charges, especially in an antenna, the power also depends on the direction.

Wait, but the question says that the maximum power is A. So the function f is such that A is the maximum. So I need to find f(theta), which would be the power per unit solid angle as a function of theta.

I think for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far zone is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Because dipole radiation is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the pattern is sin^2 theta.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The dipole's electric field in the far zone is proportional to (1/r) * sin theta * e^{i(kr - wt)}, something like that. The power is the Poynting vector, which involves the cross product of E and H fields. For a dipole, the far-field Poynting vector (which gives the power per unit area) is radial and proportional to sin^2 theta. So the power is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and zero at theta=0 and 180 degrees.

But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a particular angle. So the function f(theta) would be the directional power, which for a dipole is (sin theta)^2, normalized by the maximum value. Because the maximum occurs at theta=90, where sin theta is 1, so the max f(theta) is 1. So the fraction at any angle is (sin theta)^2.

Wait, but let me clarify. The question says the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the radiation intensity. For a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the maximum intensity occurs at theta=90 degrees, where it's highest.

So the fraction of the maximum A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees is (sin 30)^2. Because the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin^2 theta, so the fraction is (sin theta)^2 divided by the max, which is 1.

Sin 30 degrees is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 is 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

So looking at the options, which options have 1/4 as the first value? Let's check:

Option B is 1/4, lambda^-3.

Option C is 1/4, lambda^-4.

So I need to figure out what the dependence of f on lambda is.

Wait, the function f depends on lambda, which is the wavelength. The wavelength is related to the frequency and the speed of light. So for radiation from an oscillating charge, the power emitted usually depends on the frequency (or wavelength) in a certain way.

In the Larmor formula, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is proportional to a^2, where a is the acceleration. For oscillating charges, the acceleration varies with time, but the average power can be found. For a sinusoidal oscillation, the average power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the acceleration, and inversely proportional to the cube of the wavelength. Because the frequency f is inversely proportional to wavelength, and the acceleration a might be proportional to some function of f, perhaps.

Wait, the Larmor formula is P = (e^2 a^2)/(6πε0 c^3). If the charge is oscillating with some frequency f, then the acceleration a is related to the angular frequency ω. For a sinusoidal oscillation, a = a0 * sin(ωt + φ), so the average a^2 would be (a0^2 ω^2 )/(2), maybe. Wait, wait, the time derivative of velocity is acceleration. So if the velocity is v = v0 sin(ωt), then acceleration a is dv/dt = -v0 ω cos(ωt). So the square of acceleration is a^2 = v0^2 ω^2 cos²(ωt). The average over a cycle would be (v0^2 ω^2)/2.

So the average power would be proportional to a^2, which is proportional to ω^2. Since ω is 2πf, and f is 1/T, and λ = c T, so λ = c/f. So f = c/λ. So ω = 2π c / λ.

So substituting back, the average power P_avg is proportional to ( (e^2)/(6πε0 c^3) ) * (v0^2 ω^2 )/2.

Assuming v0 is some characteristic velocity, perhaps of the charge, but for an oscillating charge in an antenna, perhaps the dipole moment is oscillating sinusoidally. Alternatively, the power can be expressed in terms of the dipole moment's second time derivative.

Wait, maybe another approach. For an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is given by P = ( (μ0 μ^2 ω^4 )/( 12π c^3 ) ), where μ is the dipole moment. But dipole moment μ is related to the charge and displacement, so perhaps the power depends on ω^4.

But regardless, the key point is the dependence on lambda. Since ω = 2π c / λ, ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ)^4. So the power P is proportional to (1/λ)^4.

But wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, the radiation is isotropic in the sense that the intensity (power per solid angle) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles, which would be the integral of sin^2 theta dΩ, which is (4π/3), but wait, for a dipole, wait:

Wait, no, wait. The total power radiated is A, which is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles (4π steradians). So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ. For a dipole, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So integrating sin^2 theta over theta from 0 to pi and phi from 0 to 2pi:

The integral becomes ∫ (sin^2 theta) * sin theta dtheta dphi from 0 to pi and 0 to 2pi.

Wait, no, the integral is over theta from 0 to pi and phi 0 to 2pi. The integral for dΩ is sin theta dtheta dphi.

So ∫ sin^2 theta * sin theta dtheta dphi = ∫ sin^3 theta dtheta ∫ dphi.

The phi integral is 2pi. The theta integral is ∫0 to pi sin^3 theta d theta.

Let me compute that. The integral of sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi.

We can split it as ∫ sin^3 theta d theta = ∫ (1 - cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta.

Let u = cos theta, du = -sin theta d theta.

So integral becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1.

Which is ∫ from 1 to -1 of (1 - u^2) (-du) → ∫ from -1 to 1 (1 - u^2) du.

Which is [u - (u^3)/3 ] evaluated from -1 to 1.

At u=1: 1 - (1/3) = 2/3.

At u=-1: (-1) - [ (-1)^3 /3 ] → (-1) - (-1/3) )= (-1 + 1/3) = -2/3.

So the difference is (2/3) - (-2/3 )= 4/3.

So the theta integral is 4/3.

So the total integral is 2pi * (4/3 ) = (8 pi)/3.

But wait, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta, so the integral of f would be K * (8 pi /3 ), where K is the proportionality constant. But A is given as the maximum value, so perhaps in this case, A is equal to the integral of f, so f(theta) = (something) * sin^2 theta, and A is the integral of that.

But perhaps I'm getting a bit off track. The main point is that the function f is proportional to sin^2 theta, and the fraction at theta=30 degrees is (sin 30)^2 = 1/4, which matches what I thought earlier.

Now about the dependence on lambda. If the power P is proportional to (1/lambda)^4, then the function f is proportional to (1/lambda)^4 multiplied by sin^2 theta. So f(theta) = C * (1/lambda^4) * sin^2 theta. So the function f has a dependence of lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, the function f is either lambda^-4 (options A and C) or lambda^-3 (B), etc.

So the function f has a lambda^-4 dependence.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function is lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again. Earlier, I thought that the power (P) is proportional to (1/lambda)^4. But the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. So if P is proportional to (1/lambda)^4, and the intensity is f(theta) = (some constant) * (1/lambda^4) sin^2 theta, then the integral of f over all solid angles would be the total power P = (some constant) * (1/lambda^4) * (8 pi /3 ), as I calculated.

So the function f would have a (1/lambda^4) dependence.

So looking at the options, the correct option is C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about the dependence: the Larmor formula says that the power is proportional to a^2. For an oscillating charge, the acceleration a is the second derivative of the position. For simple harmonic motion, a = -omega^2 x_0 sin(omega t). So the square of the acceleration is proportional to omega^4.

But omega is 2 pi f. And lambda = c / f, so f = c / lambda. So omega = 2 pi c / lambda.

Therefore, a^2 is proportional to (c^2 / lambda^2 )^2 = c^4 / lambda^4.

So the power P is proportional to a^2, so P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Therefore, the intensity f(theta) is proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2 theta.

So the function f is of the form proportional to lambda^-4 multiplied by sin^2 theta.

So the correct option is C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function is lambda^-4.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution along the z-axis, which radiates power in the radiation zone. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) relative to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   For a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern is symmetric about the z-axis. The power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\) in the far field. This is a characteristic feature of dipole-like radiation, where the intensity is maximum at \(\theta = 90^\circ\) and decreases symmetrically toward \(\theta = 0^\circ\) and \(\theta = 180^\circ\).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\)**:  
   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle is given by the ratio of the intensity at that angle to the maximum intensity. Since the intensity is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\), the fraction is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = \sin^2(30^\circ) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

3. **Dependence of \(f\) on \(\lambda\)**:  
   The total power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which depends on the angular frequency \(\omega\). For oscillations at frequency \(f\), \(\omega \propto 1/\lambda\). Substituting \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\), the power is proportional to \((1/\lambda)^4\). Since the intensity \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is the power per unit solid angle, it also depends on \((1/\lambda)^4\). Thus, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form:  
   \[
   f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the above analysis, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **C**.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(\lambda^{-4}\).

Okay, so I've got this question about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and it's along the z-axis. The question is about the radiated power in the radiation zone, specifically the function f which depends on lambda and theta. The max power is A, and I need to find what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also the form of f. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation has certain patterns depending on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is a spheroid along the z-axis, it probably has rotational symmetry around z. So the radiation pattern would depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is a maximum at theta = 90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis. But this is a spheroid, which is more like an oscillating dipole but maybe with higher multipoles involved. Or wait, perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states it's an oscillating charge distribution. So maybe it's a dipole? Because a dipole is a simple oscillating charge distribution. Oh, but it's spheroidal, so perhaps it's a dipole moment oscillating in a particular way.

In the radiation zone, the fields fall off as 1/r, and the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge, I think. Oh wait, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is given by the Larmor formula. The power is ( (e^2 a^2 )/( 6πε0 c^3 )) or something like that. But for oscillating charges, especially in an antenna, the power also depends on the direction.

Wait, but the question says that the maximum power is A. So the function f is such that A is the maximum. So I need to find f(theta), which would be the power per unit solid angle as a function of theta.

I think for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far zone is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Because dipole radiation is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the pattern is sin^2 theta.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The dipole's electric field in the far zone is proportional to (1/r) * sin theta * e^{i(kr - wt)}, something like that. The power is the Poynting vector, which involves the cross product of E and H fields. For a dipole, the far-field Poynting vector (which gives the power per unit area) is radial and proportional to sin^2 theta. So the power is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and zero at theta=0 and 180 degrees.

But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a particular angle. So the function f(theta) would be the directional power, which for a dipole is (sin theta)^2, normalized by the maximum value. Because the maximum occurs at theta=90, where sin theta is 1, so the max f(theta) is 1. So the fraction at any angle is (sin theta)^2.

Wait, but let me clarify. The question says the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the radiation intensity. For a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the maximum intensity occurs at theta=90 degrees, where it's highest.

So the fraction of the maximum A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees is (sin 30)^2. Because the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin^2 theta, so the fraction is (sin theta)^2 divided by the max, which is 1.

Sin 30 degrees is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 is 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

So looking at the options, which options have 1/4 as the first value? Let's check:

Option B is 1/4, lambda^-3.

Option C is 1/4, lambda^-4.

So I need to figure out what the dependence of f on lambda is.

Wait, the function f depends on lambda, which is the wavelength. The wavelength is related to the frequency and the speed of light. So for radiation from an oscillating charge, the power emitted usually depends on the frequency (or wavelength) in a certain way.

In the Larmor formula, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is proportional to a^2, where a is the acceleration. For oscillating charges, the acceleration varies with time, but the average power can be found. For a sinusoidal oscillation, the average power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the acceleration, and inversely proportional to the cube of the wavelength. Because the frequency f is inversely proportional to wavelength, and the acceleration a might be proportional to some function of f, perhaps.

Wait, the Larmor formula is P = (e^2 a^2)/(6πε0 c^3). If the charge is oscillating with some frequency f, then the acceleration a is related to the angular frequency ω. For a sinusoidal oscillation, a = a0 * sin(ωt + φ), so the average a^2 would be (a0^2 ω^2 )/(2), maybe. Wait, wait, the time derivative of velocity is acceleration. So if the velocity is v = v0 sin(ωt), then acceleration a is dv/dt = -v0 ω cos(ωt). So the square of acceleration is a^2 = v0^2 ω^2 cos²(ωt). The average over a cycle would be (v0^2 ω^2)/2.

So the average power would be proportional to a^2, which is proportional to ω^2. Since ω is 2πf, and f is 1/T, and λ = c T, so λ = c/f. So f = c/λ. So ω = 2π c / λ.

So substituting back, the average power P_avg is proportional to ( (e^2)/(6πε0 c^3) ) * (v0^2 ω^2 )/2.

Assuming v0 is some characteristic velocity, perhaps of the charge, but for an oscillating charge in an antenna, perhaps the dipole moment is oscillating sinusoidally. Alternatively, the power can be expressed in terms of the dipole moment's second time derivative.

Wait, maybe another approach. For an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is given by P = ( (μ0 μ^2 ω^4 )/( 12π c^3 ) ), where μ is the dipole moment. But dipole moment μ is related to the charge and displacement, so perhaps the power depends on ω^4.

But regardless, the key point is the dependence on lambda. Since ω = 2π c / λ, ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ)^4. So the power P is proportional to (1/λ)^4.

But wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, the radiation is isotropic in the sense that the intensity (power per solid angle) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles, which would be the integral of sin^2 theta dΩ, which is (4π/3), but wait, for a dipole, wait:

Wait, no, wait. The total power radiated is A, which is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles (4π steradians). So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ. For a dipole, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So integrating sin^2 theta over theta from 0 to pi and phi from 0 to 2pi:

The integral becomes ∫ (sin^2 theta) * sin theta dtheta dphi from 0 to pi and 0 to 2pi.

Wait, no, the integral is over theta from 0 to pi and phi 0 to 2pi. The integral for dΩ is sin theta dtheta dphi.

So ∫ sin^2 theta * sin theta dtheta dphi = ∫ sin^3 theta dtheta ∫ dphi.

The phi integral is 2pi. The theta integral is ∫0 to pi sin^3 theta d theta.

Let me compute that. The integral of sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi.

We can split it as ∫ sin^3 theta d theta = ∫ (1 - cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta.

Let u = cos theta, du = -sin theta d theta.

So integral becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1.

Which is ∫ from 1 to -1 of (1 - u^2) (-du) → ∫ from -1 to 1 (1 - u^2) du.

Which is [u - (u^3)/3 ] evaluated from -1 to 1.

At u=1: 1 - (1/3) = 2/3.

At u=-1: (-1) - [ (-1)^3 /3 ] → (-1) - (-1/3) )= (-1 + 1/3) = -2/3.

So the difference is (2/3) - (-2/3 )= 4/3.

So the theta integral is 4/3.

So the total integral is 2pi * (4/3 ) = (8 pi)/3.

But wait, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta, so the integral of f would be K * (8 pi /3 ), where K is the proportionality constant. But A is given as the maximum value, so perhaps in this case, A is equal to the integral of f, so f(theta) = (something) * sin^2 theta, and A is the integral of that.

But perhaps I'm getting a bit off track. The main point is that the function f is proportional to sin^2 theta, and the fraction at theta=30 degrees is (sin 30)^2 = 1/4, which matches what I thought earlier.

Now about the dependence on lambda. If the power P is proportional to (1/lambda)^4, then the function f is proportional to (1/lambda)^4 multiplied by sin^2 theta. So f(theta) = C * (1/lambda^4) * sin^2 theta. So the function f has a dependence of lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, the function f is either lambda^-4 (options A and C) or lambda^-3 (B), etc.

So the function f has a lambda^-4 dependence.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function is lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again. Earlier, I thought that the power (P) is proportional to (1/lambda)^4. But the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. So if P is proportional to (1/lambda)^4, and the intensity is f(theta) = (some constant) * (1/lambda^4) sin^2 theta, then the integral of f over all solid angles would be the total power P = (some constant) * (1/lambda^4) * (8 pi /3 ), as I calculated.

So the function f would have a (1/lambda^4) dependence.

So looking at the options, the correct option is C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about the dependence: the Larmor formula says that the power is proportional to a^2. For an oscillating charge, the acceleration a is the second derivative of the position. For simple harmonic motion, a = -omega^2 x_0 sin(omega t). So the square of the acceleration is proportional to omega^4.

But omega is 2 pi f. And lambda = c / f, so f = c / lambda. So omega = 2 pi c / lambda.

Therefore, a^2 is proportional to (c^2 / lambda^2 )^2 = c^4 / lambda^4.

So the power P is proportional to a^2, so P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Therefore, the intensity f(theta) is proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2 theta.

So the function f is of the form proportional to lambda^-4 multiplied by sin^2 theta.

So the correct option is C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function is lambda^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution along the z-axis, which radiates power in the radiation zone. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) relative to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   For a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern is symmetric about the z-axis. The power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\) in the far field. This is a characteristic feature of dipole-like radiation, where the intensity is maximum at \(\theta = 90^\circ\) and decreases symmetrically toward \(\theta = 0^\circ\) and \(\theta = 180^\circ\).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\)**:  
   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle is given by the ratio of the intensity at that angle to the maximum intensity. Since the intensity is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\), the fraction is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = \sin^2(30^\circ) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

3. **Dependence of \(f\) on \(\lambda\)**:  
   The total power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which depends on the angular frequency \(\omega\). For oscillations at frequency \(f\), \(\omega \propto 1/\lambda\). Substituting \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\), the power is proportional to \((1/\lambda)^4\). Since the intensity \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is the power per unit solid angle, it also depends on \((1/\lambda)^4\). Thus, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form:  
   \[
   f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the above analysis, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **C**.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(\lambda^{-4}\).  
**Answer: C**
