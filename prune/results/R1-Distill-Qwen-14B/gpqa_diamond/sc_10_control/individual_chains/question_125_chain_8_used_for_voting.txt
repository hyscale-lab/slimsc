Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a potential. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question says the particle is in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. So this is the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the energy levels for a 3D isotropic HO are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, more precisely, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

In 3D, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, wait, no. I think each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and since it's 3D, you add them up. So that becomes E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes the principal quantum number n is used, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z + 3. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up different forms.

Wait, another way I've heard is that the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n can be 0,1,2,... and each corresponds to a shell. Each shell has a certain energy.

The question asks about the third excited state. Excited state means it's the state with the energy higher than the ground state. Ground state would be the lowest energy. Let me think about that.

Ground state is n=0: E = 3/2 ħω.

First excited state is n=1: E = (1 +3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω.

Second excited state would be n=2: E= (2 +3/2) =7/2 ħω.

Third excited state is n=3: E=(3 +3/2)=9/2 ħω. So the energy is (9/2) ħω.

So the first part of the question, the energy, is (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, options A and C have this energy. So B and D are out for the energy part.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. So for a given energy level, how many distinct eigenfunctions (or states) are there. This depends on the number of ways the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z can sum to n=3.

Wait, because n=3 comes from n_x +n_y +n_z =3. So the number of possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to that equation. That's a combinatorics problem.

The formula for the number of solutions is (3 + 3 -1) choose (3-1) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Wait, yeah, stars and bars. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =3 is (3+3-1 choose 3-1) ) =5 choose2 =10.

Alternatively, each of the quantum numbers can be 0,1,2,3, as long as they add up to 3.

So the possible combinations are:

(3,0,0), (2,1,0), (1,1,1), and their permutations.

For (3,0,0): number of permutations is 3 (since any of the three coordinates can be 3, others 0).

For (2,1,0): number is 6 (3! =6, since all are distinct).

For (1,1,1): only one way, since all are same.

So total is 3 +6 +1=10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So the question is, which option has energy (9/2) hbar ω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10 → matches.

Option C: same energy but 3 eigenfunctions → no, because 10 is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by \( E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The total quantum number \( n \) is defined as \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy can also be expressed as \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \).

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. 

1. **Energy of the Third Excited State**:  
   The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \). Each excited state increments \( n \) by 1. Thus:
   - First excited state: \( n = 1 \), \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \),
   - Second excited state: \( n = 2 \), \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \),
   - Third excited state: \( n = 3 \), \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).  
   Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

2. **Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions**:  
   For a given \( n \), the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponds to the number of ways to distribute \( n \) quanta among the three quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \). For \( n = 3 \), the possible combinations of \( (n_x, n_y, n_z) \) are:
   - \( (3, 0, 0) \): 3 permutations,
   - \( (2, 1, 0) \): 6 permutations,
   - \( (1, 1, 1) \): 1 combination.  
   Adding these, the total number of eigenfunctions is \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \).

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - Option A: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches both the energy and the number of eigenfunctions.  
   - Option B: Incorrect energy and eigenfunction count.  
   - Option C: Correct energy but incorrect eigenfunction count.  
   - Option D: Incorrect energy and eigenfunction count.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10 → matches.

Option C: same energy but 3 eigenfunctions → no, because 10 is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.
