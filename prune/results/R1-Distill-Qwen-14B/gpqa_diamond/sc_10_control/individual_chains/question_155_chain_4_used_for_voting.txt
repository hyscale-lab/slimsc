Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, there's an operator P with components Px, Py, Pz. The matrices for each are given. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state is a specific column vector. I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Hmm, right, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ − ⟨Pz⟩²).

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of Px. Does that mean anything about the expectation values? Well, if the system is in an eigenstate of one operator, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of another. So I need to calculate the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared in this state.

First, maybe I should write down the given matrices. Let me jot them down:

Px is a 3x3 matrix. The first row: 0, ħ/√2, 0. Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2. Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0.

Py is similar but with i factors. First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0. Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2. Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0.

Pz is diagonal: first element ħ, then 0, then -ħ. So Pz matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

The state vector is given as a column (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that. So the vector is ψ = [ -1/2; √2/2; -1/2 ]? Wait, wait. Wait, 1/sqrt(2) is the same as sqrt(2)/2. Wait, no, 1/sqrt(2) is  sqrt(2)/2? Let me think: sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707, which is the same as sqrt(2)/2. Because sqrt(2)/2 is 0.707. So yeah, the second component is 1/sqrt(2) which is same as sqrt(2)/2. Hmm, but the vector is written as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Or wait, perhaps the vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), so each component is scalar.

Wait, but wait, the state is given as the eigenstate of Px. So when we have a state, to find expectation values of Pz, I can just compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, expectation value of an operator is ψ† O ψ. So I need to compute these.

But first, let me make sure about the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me square each component to check normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4. (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, to compute ⟨Pz⟩: it's ψ† Pz ψ.

Since Pz is diagonal, this might be easier. The diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So ψ is [ a, b, c ] where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = a* * Pz[1,1] * a + b* * Pz[2,2] * b + c* * Pz[3,3] * c.

But wait, since Pz is diagonal, the expectation is a* * ħ * a + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) * c.

But a and c are real numbers, so a* = a, c* = c.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = a² * ħ + 0 + c² * (-ħ).

Calculating a²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly c² is 1/4.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4) ħ + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz squared would be (Pz)^2, whose diagonal elements are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So same as diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨Pz²⟩ = a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ².

a² = 1/4, c² =1/4. So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer would be B, right?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Looking at the state vector: ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

So the first component is -1/2, third is -1/2. So a = -1/2, c = -1/2.

But when we compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's (a^2)*ħ + (c^2)*(-ħ). So (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, ħ for the first term, and 1/4 times -ħ for the third. So 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0, correct.

⟨Pz²⟩ is a^2 * (ħ)^2 + c^2 * (ħ)^2. So (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ/(√2). So option B is correct.

To determine the uncertainty in \( P_z \), denoted as \( \Delta P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle P_z \rangle \)
The matrix representation of \( P_z \) is diagonal:  
\[
P_z = \text{diag}(\hbar, 0, -\hbar).
\]
The given state vector is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \)
The matrix \( P_z^2 \) is:

\[
P_z^2 = \text{diag}(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2).
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the results:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in \( P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, there's an operator P with components Px, Py, Pz. The matrices for each are given. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state is a specific column vector. I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Hmm, right, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ − ⟨Pz⟩²).

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of Px. Does that mean anything about the expectation values? Well, if the system is in an eigenstate of one operator, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of another. So I need to calculate the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared in this state.

Px is a 3x3 matrix. The first row: 0, ħ/√2, 0. Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2. Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0.

Py is similar but with i factors. First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0. Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2. Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0.

Pz is diagonal: first element ħ, then 0, then -ħ. So Pz matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

The state vector is given as a column (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that. So the vector is ψ = [ -1/2; √2/2; -1/2 ]? Wait, wait. Wait, 1/sqrt(2) is the same as sqrt(2)/2. Wait, no, 1/sqrt(2) is  sqrt(2)/2? Let me think: sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707, which is the same as sqrt(2)/2. Because sqrt(2)/2 is 0.707. So yeah, the second component is 1/sqrt(2) which is same as sqrt(2)/2. Hmm, but the vector is written as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Or wait, perhaps the vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), so each component is scalar.

Wait, but wait, the state is given as the eigenstate of Px. So when we have a state, to find expectation values of Pz, I can just compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, expectation value of an operator is ψ† O ψ. So I need to compute these.

But first, let me make sure about the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me square each component to check normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4. (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, to compute ⟨Pz⟩: it's ψ† Pz ψ.

Since Pz is diagonal, this might be easier. The diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So ψ is [ a, b, c ] where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = a* * Pz[1,1] * a + b* * Pz[2,2] * b + c* * Pz[3,3] * c.

But wait, since Pz is diagonal, the expectation is a* * ħ * a + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) * c.

But a and c are real numbers, so a* = a, c* = c.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = a² * ħ + 0 + c² * (-ħ).

Calculating a²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly c² is 1/4.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4) ħ + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz squared would be (Pz)^2, whose diagonal elements are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So same as diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨Pz²⟩ = a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ².

a² = 1/4, c² =1/4. So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer would be B, right?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Looking at the state vector: ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

So the first component is -1/2, third is -1/2. So a = -1/2, c = -1/2.

But when we compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's (a^2)*ħ + (c^2)*(-ħ). So (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, ħ for the first term, and 1/4 times -ħ for the third. So 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0, correct.

⟨Pz²⟩ is a^2 * (ħ)^2 + c^2 * (ħ)^2. So (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ/(√2). So option B is correct.


To determine the uncertainty in \( P_z \), denoted as \( \Delta P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle P_z \rangle \)
The matrix representation of \( P_z \) is diagonal:  
\[
P_z = \text{diag}(\hbar, 0, -\hbar).
\]
The given state vector is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \)
The matrix \( P_z^2 \) is:

\[
P_z^2 = \text{diag}(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2).
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the results:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in \( P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
