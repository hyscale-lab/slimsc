Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slowly.

Alright, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, I guess some mass is converted into kinetic energy or maybe energy in other forms, but probably kinetic since they're talking about the fragments' motion.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. They want the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about what's going on here. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, since momentum is conserved, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, right? So, their momenta should cancel each other out.

But because the fragments have different masses, their velocities will be different. Since one is twice as massive as the other, I think the lighter one will have a higher velocity. But how does this affect their kinetic energies?

The problem specifies that we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. But the catch is to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation of T1.

Hmm. So, I need to compare relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for T1. How do I approach this?

First, let's note down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: 300 GeV (so, M c² = 300 GeV). But I think the actual mass M is M = (300 GeV) / c². But since c is a constant, maybe we can just use energy in GeV and mass in GeV/c² for simplicity.

- After fission, two fragments: one has mass 2m, the other m (since one is twice as massive). Wait, the problem says "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other". So, let me correct that: if one is twice as massive, then the masses are m and 2m. So, the sum m + 2m = 3m is 99% of the initial mass M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So, the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus had a rest mass of M, but the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So each fragment's rest mass is 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So, the more massive fragment has rest mass 0.66 M, and the lighter one 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus had rest mass M. So, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. Does that mean that the rest mass decreased by 1%? So, the rest mass energy went from 300 GeV (since M c² = 300 GeV) to 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So, the mass difference is 3 GeV, which must have been converted into kinetic energy and perhaps other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says "nothing else" is produced, so perhaps all the energy goes into kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, wait. The problem statement says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So, the mass that's lost (1%) is probably converted into kinetic energy. So, the total kinetic energy of both fragments is (300 GeV - 297 GeV) = 3 GeV.

But wait, because the problem is about the kinetic energy of each fragment, I think we need to compute how that 3 GeV is split between the two. But since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about this in terms of relativistic mechanics. Because the fragments are likely moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects are important, so the non-relativistic approximation might be invalid. So, the question is, what's the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic calculation for T1.

So, let's denote the two fragments as fragment A (mass 2m = 0.66 M) and fragment B (mass m = 0.33 M). Let their velocities be v_A and v_B, respectively.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, their momenta must be p_A and p_B, with p_A = - p_B.

But wait, the direction doesn't matter; their magnitudes must be equal. So, |p_A| = |p_B|.

So, in terms of relativistic momentum, p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, for fragment A: p_A = γ_A m_A v_A

Fragment B: p_B = γ_B m_B v_B

Since |p_A| = |p_B|, we have γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B.

But m_A = 2 m_B, because m_A is 2m and m_B is m. Wait, wait, m_A is 0.66 M and m_B is 0.33 M. So, m_A = 2 m_B. So, m_A = 2 m_B → m_B = m_A / 2.

So, substituting, γ_A (2 m_B) v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

So, 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B. Hmm, equation (1).

Also, the kinetic energy of each fragment is the total energy minus rest mass energy.

So, the kinetic energy T_A = (γ_A m_A c²) - m_A c² = (γ_A -1) m_A c².

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B - 1) m_B c².

The total kinetic energy is T_A + T_B = 3 GeV.

So, (γ_A -1) m_A c² + (γ_B -1) m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_A = 2 m_B, so substituting:

(γ_A - 1) (2 m_B) c² + (γ_B -1) m_B c² = 3 GeV.

Factor m_B c²:

[ 2 (γ_A -1 ) + (γ_B - 1) ] m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B = m_A / 2, and m_A = 0.66 M, so m_B = 0.33 M. Wait, but perhaps it's better to express m_B in terms of M.

Alternatively, let's note that m_A + m_B = 0.99 M. Since m_A = 2 m_B, 3 m_B = 0.99 M → m_B = 0.33 M, m_A = 0.66 M.

But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of m_B. Let me define m_B = m, so m_A = 2m. Then, 3 m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M.

So, m_A = 0.66 M, m_B = 0.33 M.

Now, the kinetic energy equation becomes:

[2 (γ_A -1 ) + (γ_B - 1)] * m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B = 0.33 M.

We also have the momentum equation: 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can express v_A and v_B in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between the velocities and the gamma factors.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. Since the two fragments are moving in opposite directions, let's say v_A is in the positive direction and v_B in the negative. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p_A = - p_B.

So, γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → γ_A (2 m) v_A = γ_B m v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

So, equation (1): 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

But I'm not sure how to relate v_A and v_B beyond that. Maybe I can write v_B = (2 γ_A v_A) / γ_B.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the kinetic energies in terms of each other. Let's think about the ratio of the kinetic energies.

Wait, the masses are different, so their velocities are different, but their kinetic energies would depend on both mass and velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the relation between the kinetic energies and the masses.

Wait, another approach. Since the problem is about the difference between relativistic and classical T1, perhaps I can compute T1 in both cases and then find the difference.

But what's the correct way to compute T1? Let's think about the classical approach first.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, we can use conservation of momentum and energy.

In the classical case, the kinetic energy of each fragment would be (1/2) m v^2.

So, let's compute for the non-relativistic case.

Momentum conservation: m_A v_A = m_B v_B.

But wait, because the initial momentum is zero, so m_A v_A = - m_B v_B → m_A v_A = m_B v_B (since v_B is in the opposite direction).

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², so for two masses, m_A and m_B, moving with velocities v_A and v_B, respectively.

We have m_A v_A = m_B v_B → v_B = (m_A / m_B ) v_A.

Since m_A is twice m_B, so m_A = 2 m_B → v_B = (2 m_B / m_B ) v_A → v_B = 2 v_A.

Wait, that's interesting. So, v_B is twice as v_A.

But wait, no. Wait, momentum conservation: m_A v_A = m_B v_B → since m_A = 2 m_B, then 2 m_B v_A = m_B v_B → v_B = 2 v_A.

So, v_B = 2 v_A.

Now, the kinetic energies are T_A = (1/2) m_A v_A² = (1/2)(2 m_B)(v_A²) = m_B v_A².

Similarly, T_B = (1/2) m_B v_B² = (1/2) m_B (2 v_A)^2 = (1/2) m_B (4 v_A^2) )= 2 m_B v_A².

So, T_A = m_B v_A², T_B = 2 m_B v_A².

Total kinetic energy = T_A + T_B = 3 m_B v_A².

But earlier, we said that the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So,

3 m_B v_A² =3 GeV → m_B v_A² = 1 GeV.

So, T_A = 1 GeV, T_B = 2 GeV.

So, in the classical case, T1 (the more massive fragment's KE) is T_A = 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the more massive fragment is m_A, so T_A is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So, yes, in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's 1 GeV. Now, the actual T1 is relativistic, which is (γ_A -1) m_A c².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energy is greater than the non-relativistic value. So, the difference would be (relativistic T1) - (non-relativistic T1) → positive value.

But the options are in MeV, so the difference is likely a few MeV.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the numbers again. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So, 3 GeV is the total KE. In the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, but in reality, it's higher due to relativistic effects.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The total KE is 3 GeV. So, in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV.

But when we compute the relativistic case, the kinetic energies might be different. So, perhaps the relativistic calculation for T1 would be higher than 1 GeV, and the difference is the amount by which it's higher than the classical value.

But let's proceed to calculate the relativistic T1.

Hmm. To calculate the relativistic case, I think we have to set up the equations more carefully.

We can denote the following variables:

m_A = 2m, m_B = m.

From the problem, m_A + m_B = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

So, initial nucleus has rest mass M. The fragments have rest mass 0.66 M and 0.33 M, and the sum is 0.99 M.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have momenta p_A and p_B, such that p_A = -p_B.

So, p_A = γ_A m_A v_A, and p_B = γ_B m_B v_B.

So, from momentum conservation:

γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B.

But m_A = 2m_B, so substituting, γ_A (2 m_B) v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B. Equation (1).

Now, the kinetic energy of each fragment is T_A = (γ_A - 1) m_A c², T_B = (γ_B - 1) m_B c².

Total KE: T_A + T_B = 3 GeV.

So:

(γ_A -1) (2m_B) c² + (γ_B - 1) (m_B) c² = 3 GeV.

Factor out m_B c²:

[ 2 (γ_A -1) + (γ_B -1) ] m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B c² is (0.33 M) c².

Since M c² is 300 GeV, m_B c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so m_B c² is (0.33 M) c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

[ 2 (γ_A -1) + (γ_B -1) ] * 99 GeV = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

2(γ_A - 1) + (γ_B - 1) = 3 / 99 → 1/33.

So,

2 γ_A - 2 + γ_B - 1 = 1/33 → 2 γ_A + γ_B = (1/33) + 3 → which is 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.

Wait, 3 is approximately 3.0303? Wait, 1/33 is about 0.0303, so 3 + 0.0303 is 3.0303.

So, Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

Now, from Equation (1), 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B → v_B = (2 γ_A v_A) / γ_B.

But in terms of velocities, perhaps we can relate v_A and v_B using the beta factors.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to find a relationship between γ_A and γ_B.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of γ_A.

Wait, let me try to find another equation. From the velocities, perhaps I can write v_A in terms of v_B, using Equation (1).

But without another equation, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the velocities and the gamma factors.

Wait, we can express v in terms of beta and c. So, v = β c.

So, v_A = β_A c, v_B = β_B c.

Substituting into Equation (1):

2 γ_A (β_A c) = γ_B (β_B c) → 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

So, Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Hmm. But we can also express β in terms of gamma: β = √(1 - 1/γ²).

Wait, that's correct. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β² = 1 - (1/γ²). So, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So, substituting into Equation (1a):

2 γ_A sqrt(1 - 1/γ_A²) = γ_B sqrt(1 - 1/γ_B²).

This looks complicated, but maybe we can make some approximations.

Wait, but what if the fragments are moving at non-relativistic speeds? Then, γ would be approximately 1, and β ≈ v/c. But in our problem, the classical approach gave T1 as 1 GeV, which is about 0.33% of the rest mass energy of the fragment (since m_A c² is 198 GeV (0.66 * 300 GeV), so 1 GeV is about 0.5% of 198 GeV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, while 198 GeV is 1.98e11 eV. So, 1 GeV is about 0.005% of 198 GeV. So, perhaps non-relativistic is a good approximation. But the problem states that the correct T1 is to be compared with the classical approximation, so perhaps the relativistic calculation shows that the KE is a bit higher.

But perhaps the velocities are not that high, so γ is close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that γ_A is approximately 1, but that might not hold. Let's see.

Wait, if the velocity is low, then γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). So, perhaps for small velocities, we can approximate γ as 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, so relativistic effects are minor.

Wait, but for the more massive fragment, the rest mass energy is 198 GeV, and the kinetic energy in the classical case is 1 GeV, which is 0.5% of the rest mass. So, perhaps relativistic corrections are minor, but we have to compute them to find the difference.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for small velocities, γ ≈ 1 + (p²)/(2 m² c²), where p is the momentum.

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the equations in terms of γ_A and γ_B, and then solve numerically.

Wait, let's go back to the equations we have.

Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

And another equation comes from the total energy.

Wait, wait. The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

But the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest energies is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, the total energy after fission is 297 GeV + 3 GeV (kinetic) = 300 GeV, which matches the initial rest energy. So, energy is conserved.

But perhaps that gives another equation? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps if I can write γ_A and γ_B in terms of each other, using Equation (1a) and (2).

But this seems challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that γ_A is much larger than 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can make the initial assumption that γ_A ≈ γ_B. But I don't think that's valid because m_A is twice as heavy as m_B, so their velocities would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are small enough that γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), which would allow me to approximate the equations.

Let me try that.

So, assuming that v_A and v_B are small enough that γ is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, γ_A ≈ 1 + (v_A²)/(2 c²), and γ_B ≈1 + (v_B²)/(2 c²).

But substituting this into equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 2 (1 + v_A²/(2 c²)) + (1 + v_B²/(2 c²)) ) = 3 + (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²).

But equation (2) says 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 3.0303.

So, 3 + (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²) ≈ 3.0303 → (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²) ≈ 0.0303 → (v_A² + v_B²) ≈ 0.0303 c².

Hmm, but that's just an approximation.

But from equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Assuming γ ≈1, then β ≈ v/c.

So, 2 (1)(v_A/c) ≈ (1)(v_B/c) → 2 v_A ≈ v_B.

Which matches the non-relativistic case.

So, proceeding with the approximation that v_B = 2 v_A.

So, from equation (1a), v_B = 2 v_A.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

(v_A² + (2 v_A)^2 ) ≈ 0.0303 c² → v_A² (1 +4) = 5 v_A² ≈ 0.0303 c² → v_A² ≈ 0.0303 c² /5 → v_A² ≈ 0.00606 c² → v_A ≈ sqrt(0.00606) c ≈ 0.0778 c.

So, v_A is about 7.78% the speed of light. That's not too high, but perhaps not negligible. So, maybe the relativistic effects are small but non-negligible.

So, let's compute γ_A and γ_B.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β² ), where β = v/c.

So, β_A = 0.0778 → β_A² ≈ 0.00606.

So, 1 - β_A² ≈ 0.99394 → sqrt(0.99394) ≈ 0.99696 → γ_A ≈ 1 / 0.99696 ≈ 1.00305.

Similarly, v_B = 2 v_A → β_B = 2 * 0.0778 = 0.1556 → β_B² ≈ 0.0242.

So, 1 - β_B² ≈ 0.9758 → sqrt(0.9758) ≈ 0.9878 → γ_B ≈ 1 / 0.9878 ≈1.0123.

Now, let's compute equation (2) using these γ values.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 2 * 1.00305 + 1.0123 ≈ 2.0061 + 1.0123 ≈ 3.0184.

But according to equation (2), it should be approximately 3.0303. So, our approximation is close but not exact. So, perhaps our assumption that γ is close to 1 is not accurate enough, but maybe it's good enough for an approximate calculation.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

T_A = (γ_A - 1) m_A c².

m_A c² is 198 GeV (0.66 * 300 GeV).

So, T_A = (1.00305 - 1) * 198 GeV = 0.00305 * 198 ≈ 0.6059 GeV → 605.9 MeV.

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B -1 ) m_B c².

m_B c² is 99 GeV.

γ_B ≈ 1.0123 → T_B = 0.0123 * 99 GeV ≈ 1.2177 GeV → 1217.7 MeV.

Total KE in relativistic case: 605.9 MeV + 1217.7 MeV = 1823.6 MeV → 1.8236 GeV.

But wait, the total KE should be 3 GeV, but here it's only about 1.82 GeV. So, this suggests that our approximation is not sufficient. Thus, our assumption that γ is close to 1 is not accurate enough, and we need a better approach.

Hmm. Maybe I should approach this using the exact equations.

Let me re-express the equations.

We have:

Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

We need to solve these two equations for γ_A and γ_B.

Let me express β_A and β_B in terms of γ.

β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So, β_A = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_A²)), β_B = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_B²)).

Substituting into equation (1a):

2 γ_A sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_A²)) = γ_B sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_B²)).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

(2 γ_A)^2 (1 - 1/(γ_A²)) = γ_B^2 (1 - 1/(γ_B^2)).

Simplify:

4 γ_A² (1 - 1/γ_A²) = γ_B² (1 - 1/γ_B²).

Simplify left side:

4 γ_A² ( (γ_A² - 1)/γ_A² ) ) → 4 (γ_A² -1).

Right side: γ_B² ( (γ_B² -1)/γ_B² ) → (γ_B^4 - γ_B²)/γ_B² → (γ_B^2 -1).

So, left side = 4 (γ_A^2 -1) = right side = γ_B^2 -1.

So,

4 γ_A² -4 = γ_B² -1 → 4 γ_A² = γ_B² +3 → equation (3): γ_B² =4 γ_A² -3.

Now, from equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

We can express γ_B as (3.0303 - 2 γ_A).

So, γ_B = 3.0303 - 2 γ_A.

Now, substituting into equation (3):

(3.0303 - 2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A² -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 * 3.0303 * 2 γ_A + (2 γ_A)^2 = 4 γ_A^2 -3.

Compute (3.0303)^2: approx (3.03)^2 = 9.1809.

So,

9.1809 - 12.1212 γ_A +4 γ_A^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Subtract 4 γ_A^2 from both sides:

9.1809 -12.1212 γ_A = -3.

Bring all terms to left:

9.1809 +3 -12.1212 γ_A =0 → 12.1809 -12.1212 γ_A =0 → 12.1809 = 12.1212 γ_A.

So,

γ_A = 12.1809 / 12.1212 ≈ 1.005.

So, γ_A ≈ 1.005.

Then, γ_B =3.0303 -2*1.005 →3.0303 -2.010 →1.0203.

Now, check equation (3): γ_B² =4 (1.005)^2 -3.

4 * (1.005)^2 =4*(1.010025)=4.0401 → 4.0401 -3=1.0401.

γ_B² = (1.0203)^2≈1.0409.

Hmm, close but not exact. So, perhaps our approximation is not precise enough, but it's getting closer.

Now, let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute γ_A and γ_B more accurately.

We have equation (3): γ_B² =4 γ_A^2 -3.

And equation (2): γ_B = 3.0303 -2 γ_A.

Substituting into (3):

(3.0303 -2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 *3.0303 *2 γ_A + (2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Which is:

9.1818 -12.1212 γ_A +4 γ_A^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Cancel 4 γ_A^2 from both sides:

9.1818 -12.1212 γ_A = -3 → 9.1818 +3 =12.1212 γ_A → 12.1818 =12.1212 γ_A → γ_A =12.1818 /12.1212 ≈1.005.

So, γ_A ≈1.005.

Then, γ_B =3.0303 -2*(1.005)=3.0303 -2.010=1.0203.

Now, let's compute equation (3) precisely.

Compute 4 γ_A^2 -3 =4*(1.005)^2 -3.

1.005 squared is 1.010025. Multiply by 4:4.0401. Subtract 3:1.0401.

γ_B^2 should be (1.0203)^2 = approx 1.0409.

So, 1.0409 ≈1.0401. Close enough for an approximate solution.

So, let's proceed with these values.

Now, compute the kinetic energies:

T_A = (γ_A -1) m_A c².

m_A c² is 198 GeV.

γ_A =1.005 → γ_A -1=0.005.

So, T_A =0.005 *198 GeV=0.99 GeV =990 MeV.

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B -1) m_B c².

γ_B=1.0203 → γ_B -1=0.0203.

m_B c² is 99 GeV.

So, T_B=0.0203 *99 GeV≈2 GeV (approx 2.0097 GeV).

So, total KE is 0.99 GeV +2.0097 GeV ≈3.0 GeV, which matches.

So, in the relativistic case, T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV (1000 MeV).

So, the difference is 990 MeV -1000 MeV = -10 MeV. But wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical was 1000 MeV. The difference is -10 MeV, but since the question is about the magnitude, it's 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute. The options are in positive MeV, so the correct value is less than the classical, so the difference would be negative, but the question says "the difference between the correct value and the classical value." So, the correct is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV. The difference is -10 MeV, but the options are positive, so perhaps the answer is 10 MeV, suggesting that the correct value is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

So, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 990 MeV - 1000 MeV = -10 MeV. But I think the problem expects the magnitude, so 10 MeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 10 MeV. So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because in the relativistic case, T1 is 990 MeV, which is less than the non-relativistic case of 1000 MeV. So, the correct value is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation. So, the difference is -10 MeV, but the question just asks for the difference, so probably 10 MeV.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 10 MeV.

To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \), corresponding to a rest mass \( M \).
- After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:
  - Fragment A (more massive): \( m_A = 0.66M \).
  - Fragment B (less massive): \( m_B = 0.33M \).
- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99M \), meaning \( 1\% \) of the initial rest mass is converted into kinetic energy, totaling \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma_B m_B v_B,
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( m \) is the rest mass.

2. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:
   \[
   T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV},
   \]
   where \( T_A = (\gamma_A - 1)m_A c^2 \) and \( T_B = (\gamma_B - 1)m_B c^2 \).

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case:
- Momentum conservation gives \( m_A v_A = m_B v_B \). Since \( m_A = 2m_B \), we find \( v_B = 2v_A \).
- The kinetic energy of each fragment is \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Substituting \( v_B = 2v_A \), the total kinetic energy is:
  \[
  T_A + T_B = \frac{1}{2}m_A v_A^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B (2v_A)^2 = 3m_B v_A^2.
  \]
- Using \( T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), we find \( T_A = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( T_B = 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

Thus, in the non-relativistic case, \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case:
1. Using momentum conservation and energy conservation, we solve for \( \gamma_A \) and \( \gamma_B \). After detailed calculations, we find:
   \[
   \gamma_A \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_B \approx 1.0203.
   \]
2. The kinetic energy of Fragment A is:
   \[
   T_A = (\gamma_A - 1)m_A c^2 = (1.005 - 1)(0.66 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}) = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
3. Similarly, the kinetic energy of Fragment B is:
   \[
   T_B = (\gamma_B - 1)m_B c^2 = (1.0203 - 1)(0.33 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}) \approx 2.01 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   The total kinetic energy is \( T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), confirming the calculations.

Thus, in the relativistic case, \( T_1 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{non-relativistic}} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = -0.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Taking the magnitude, the difference is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) value and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slowly.

Alright, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, I guess some mass is converted into kinetic energy or maybe energy in other forms, but probably kinetic since they're talking about the fragments' motion.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. They want the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about what's going on here. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, since momentum is conserved, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, right? So, their momenta should cancel each other out.

But because the fragments have different masses, their velocities will be different. Since one is twice as massive as the other, I think the lighter one will have a higher velocity. But how does this affect their kinetic energies?

The problem specifies that we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. But the catch is to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation of T1.

Hmm. So, I need to compare relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for T1. How do I approach this?

First, let's note down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: 300 GeV (so, M c² = 300 GeV). But I think the actual mass M is M = (300 GeV) / c². But since c is a constant, maybe we can just use energy in GeV and mass in GeV/c² for simplicity.

- After fission, two fragments: one has mass 2m, the other m (since one is twice as massive). Wait, the problem says "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other". So, let me correct that: if one is twice as massive, then the masses are m and 2m. So, the sum m + 2m = 3m is 99% of the initial mass M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So, the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus had a rest mass of M, but the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So each fragment's rest mass is 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So, the more massive fragment has rest mass 0.66 M, and the lighter one 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus had rest mass M. So, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. Does that mean that the rest mass decreased by 1%? So, the rest mass energy went from 300 GeV (since M c² = 300 GeV) to 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So, the mass difference is 3 GeV, which must have been converted into kinetic energy and perhaps other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says "nothing else" is produced, so perhaps all the energy goes into kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, wait. The problem statement says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So, the mass that's lost (1%) is probably converted into kinetic energy. So, the total kinetic energy of both fragments is (300 GeV - 297 GeV) = 3 GeV.

But wait, because the problem is about the kinetic energy of each fragment, I think we need to compute how that 3 GeV is split between the two. But since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about this in terms of relativistic mechanics. Because the fragments are likely moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects are important, so the non-relativistic approximation might be invalid. So, the question is, what's the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic calculation for T1.

So, let's denote the two fragments as fragment A (mass 2m = 0.66 M) and fragment B (mass m = 0.33 M). Let their velocities be v_A and v_B, respectively.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, their momenta must be p_A and p_B, with p_A = - p_B.

But wait, the direction doesn't matter; their magnitudes must be equal. So, |p_A| = |p_B|.

So, in terms of relativistic momentum, p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, for fragment A: p_A = γ_A m_A v_A

Fragment B: p_B = γ_B m_B v_B

Since |p_A| = |p_B|, we have γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B.

But m_A = 2 m_B, because m_A is 2m and m_B is m. Wait, wait, m_A is 0.66 M and m_B is 0.33 M. So, m_A = 2 m_B. So, m_A = 2 m_B → m_B = m_A / 2.

So, substituting, γ_A (2 m_B) v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

So, 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B. Hmm, equation (1).

Also, the kinetic energy of each fragment is the total energy minus rest mass energy.

So, the kinetic energy T_A = (γ_A m_A c²) - m_A c² = (γ_A -1) m_A c².

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B - 1) m_B c².

The total kinetic energy is T_A + T_B = 3 GeV.

So, (γ_A -1) m_A c² + (γ_B -1) m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_A = 2 m_B, so substituting:

(γ_A - 1) (2 m_B) c² + (γ_B -1) m_B c² = 3 GeV.

Factor m_B c²:

[ 2 (γ_A -1 ) + (γ_B - 1) ] m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B = m_A / 2, and m_A = 0.66 M, so m_B = 0.33 M. Wait, but perhaps it's better to express m_B in terms of M.

Alternatively, let's note that m_A + m_B = 0.99 M. Since m_A = 2 m_B, 3 m_B = 0.99 M → m_B = 0.33 M, m_A = 0.66 M.

But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of m_B. Let me define m_B = m, so m_A = 2m. Then, 3 m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M.

So, m_A = 0.66 M, m_B = 0.33 M.

Now, the kinetic energy equation becomes:

[2 (γ_A -1 ) + (γ_B - 1)] * m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B = 0.33 M.

We also have the momentum equation: 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can express v_A and v_B in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between the velocities and the gamma factors.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. Since the two fragments are moving in opposite directions, let's say v_A is in the positive direction and v_B in the negative. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p_A = - p_B.

So, γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → γ_A (2 m) v_A = γ_B m v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

So, equation (1): 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B.

But I'm not sure how to relate v_A and v_B beyond that. Maybe I can write v_B = (2 γ_A v_A) / γ_B.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the kinetic energies in terms of each other. Let's think about the ratio of the kinetic energies.

Wait, the masses are different, so their velocities are different, but their kinetic energies would depend on both mass and velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the relation between the kinetic energies and the masses.

Wait, another approach. Since the problem is about the difference between relativistic and classical T1, perhaps I can compute T1 in both cases and then find the difference.

But what's the correct way to compute T1? Let's think about the classical approach first.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, we can use conservation of momentum and energy.

In the classical case, the kinetic energy of each fragment would be (1/2) m v^2.

So, let's compute for the non-relativistic case.

Momentum conservation: m_A v_A = m_B v_B.

But wait, because the initial momentum is zero, so m_A v_A = - m_B v_B → m_A v_A = m_B v_B (since v_B is in the opposite direction).

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², so for two masses, m_A and m_B, moving with velocities v_A and v_B, respectively.

We have m_A v_A = m_B v_B → v_B = (m_A / m_B ) v_A.

Since m_A is twice m_B, so m_A = 2 m_B → v_B = (2 m_B / m_B ) v_A → v_B = 2 v_A.

Wait, that's interesting. So, v_B is twice as v_A.

But wait, no. Wait, momentum conservation: m_A v_A = m_B v_B → since m_A = 2 m_B, then 2 m_B v_A = m_B v_B → v_B = 2 v_A.

So, v_B = 2 v_A.

Now, the kinetic energies are T_A = (1/2) m_A v_A² = (1/2)(2 m_B)(v_A²) = m_B v_A².

Similarly, T_B = (1/2) m_B v_B² = (1/2) m_B (2 v_A)^2 = (1/2) m_B (4 v_A^2) )= 2 m_B v_A².

So, T_A = m_B v_A², T_B = 2 m_B v_A².

Total kinetic energy = T_A + T_B = 3 m_B v_A².

But earlier, we said that the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So,

3 m_B v_A² =3 GeV → m_B v_A² = 1 GeV.

So, T_A = 1 GeV, T_B = 2 GeV.

So, in the classical case, T1 (the more massive fragment's KE) is T_A = 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the more massive fragment is m_A, so T_A is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So, yes, in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's 1 GeV. Now, the actual T1 is relativistic, which is (γ_A -1) m_A c².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energy is greater than the non-relativistic value. So, the difference would be (relativistic T1) - (non-relativistic T1) → positive value.

But the options are in MeV, so the difference is likely a few MeV.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the numbers again. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So, 3 GeV is the total KE. In the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, but in reality, it's higher due to relativistic effects.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The total KE is 3 GeV. So, in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV.

But when we compute the relativistic case, the kinetic energies might be different. So, perhaps the relativistic calculation for T1 would be higher than 1 GeV, and the difference is the amount by which it's higher than the classical value.

But let's proceed to calculate the relativistic T1.

Hmm. To calculate the relativistic case, I think we have to set up the equations more carefully.

We can denote the following variables:

m_A = 2m, m_B = m.

From the problem, m_A + m_B = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

So, initial nucleus has rest mass M. The fragments have rest mass 0.66 M and 0.33 M, and the sum is 0.99 M.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have momenta p_A and p_B, such that p_A = -p_B.

So, p_A = γ_A m_A v_A, and p_B = γ_B m_B v_B.

So, from momentum conservation:

γ_A m_A v_A = γ_B m_B v_B.

But m_A = 2m_B, so substituting, γ_A (2 m_B) v_A = γ_B m_B v_B → 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B. Equation (1).

Now, the kinetic energy of each fragment is T_A = (γ_A - 1) m_A c², T_B = (γ_B - 1) m_B c².

Total KE: T_A + T_B = 3 GeV.

So:

(γ_A -1) (2m_B) c² + (γ_B - 1) (m_B) c² = 3 GeV.

Factor out m_B c²:

[ 2 (γ_A -1) + (γ_B -1) ] m_B c² = 3 GeV.

But m_B c² is (0.33 M) c².

Since M c² is 300 GeV, m_B c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so m_B c² is (0.33 M) c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

[ 2 (γ_A -1) + (γ_B -1) ] * 99 GeV = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

2(γ_A - 1) + (γ_B - 1) = 3 / 99 → 1/33.

So,

2 γ_A - 2 + γ_B - 1 = 1/33 → 2 γ_A + γ_B = (1/33) + 3 → which is 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.

Wait, 3 is approximately 3.0303? Wait, 1/33 is about 0.0303, so 3 + 0.0303 is 3.0303.

So, Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

Now, from Equation (1), 2 γ_A v_A = γ_B v_B → v_B = (2 γ_A v_A) / γ_B.

But in terms of velocities, perhaps we can relate v_A and v_B using the beta factors.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to find a relationship between γ_A and γ_B.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of γ_A.

Wait, let me try to find another equation. From the velocities, perhaps I can write v_A in terms of v_B, using Equation (1).

But without another equation, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the velocities and the gamma factors.

Wait, we can express v in terms of beta and c. So, v = β c.

So, v_A = β_A c, v_B = β_B c.

Substituting into Equation (1):

2 γ_A (β_A c) = γ_B (β_B c) → 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

So, Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Hmm. But we can also express β in terms of gamma: β = √(1 - 1/γ²).

Wait, that's correct. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β² = 1 - (1/γ²). So, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So, substituting into Equation (1a):

2 γ_A sqrt(1 - 1/γ_A²) = γ_B sqrt(1 - 1/γ_B²).

This looks complicated, but maybe we can make some approximations.

Wait, but what if the fragments are moving at non-relativistic speeds? Then, γ would be approximately 1, and β ≈ v/c. But in our problem, the classical approach gave T1 as 1 GeV, which is about 0.33% of the rest mass energy of the fragment (since m_A c² is 198 GeV (0.66 * 300 GeV), so 1 GeV is about 0.5% of 198 GeV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, while 198 GeV is 1.98e11 eV. So, 1 GeV is about 0.005% of 198 GeV. So, perhaps non-relativistic is a good approximation. But the problem states that the correct T1 is to be compared with the classical approximation, so perhaps the relativistic calculation shows that the KE is a bit higher.

But perhaps the velocities are not that high, so γ is close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that γ_A is approximately 1, but that might not hold. Let's see.

Wait, if the velocity is low, then γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). So, perhaps for small velocities, we can approximate γ as 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, so relativistic effects are minor.

Wait, but for the more massive fragment, the rest mass energy is 198 GeV, and the kinetic energy in the classical case is 1 GeV, which is 0.5% of the rest mass. So, perhaps relativistic corrections are minor, but we have to compute them to find the difference.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for small velocities, γ ≈ 1 + (p²)/(2 m² c²), where p is the momentum.

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the equations in terms of γ_A and γ_B, and then solve numerically.

Wait, let's go back to the equations we have.

Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

And another equation comes from the total energy.

Wait, wait. The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

But the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest energies is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, the total energy after fission is 297 GeV + 3 GeV (kinetic) = 300 GeV, which matches the initial rest energy. So, energy is conserved.

But perhaps that gives another equation? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps if I can write γ_A and γ_B in terms of each other, using Equation (1a) and (2).

But this seems challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that γ_A is much larger than 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can make the initial assumption that γ_A ≈ γ_B. But I don't think that's valid because m_A is twice as heavy as m_B, so their velocities would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are small enough that γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), which would allow me to approximate the equations.

Let me try that.

So, assuming that v_A and v_B are small enough that γ is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, γ_A ≈ 1 + (v_A²)/(2 c²), and γ_B ≈1 + (v_B²)/(2 c²).

But substituting this into equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 2 (1 + v_A²/(2 c²)) + (1 + v_B²/(2 c²)) ) = 3 + (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²).

But equation (2) says 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 3.0303.

So, 3 + (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²) ≈ 3.0303 → (v_A² + v_B²)/(c²) ≈ 0.0303 → (v_A² + v_B²) ≈ 0.0303 c².

Hmm, but that's just an approximation.

But from equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Assuming γ ≈1, then β ≈ v/c.

So, 2 (1)(v_A/c) ≈ (1)(v_B/c) → 2 v_A ≈ v_B.

Which matches the non-relativistic case.

So, proceeding with the approximation that v_B = 2 v_A.

So, from equation (1a), v_B = 2 v_A.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

(v_A² + (2 v_A)^2 ) ≈ 0.0303 c² → v_A² (1 +4) = 5 v_A² ≈ 0.0303 c² → v_A² ≈ 0.0303 c² /5 → v_A² ≈ 0.00606 c² → v_A ≈ sqrt(0.00606) c ≈ 0.0778 c.

So, v_A is about 7.78% the speed of light. That's not too high, but perhaps not negligible. So, maybe the relativistic effects are small but non-negligible.

So, let's compute γ_A and γ_B.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β² ), where β = v/c.

So, β_A = 0.0778 → β_A² ≈ 0.00606.

So, 1 - β_A² ≈ 0.99394 → sqrt(0.99394) ≈ 0.99696 → γ_A ≈ 1 / 0.99696 ≈ 1.00305.

Similarly, v_B = 2 v_A → β_B = 2 * 0.0778 = 0.1556 → β_B² ≈ 0.0242.

So, 1 - β_B² ≈ 0.9758 → sqrt(0.9758) ≈ 0.9878 → γ_B ≈ 1 / 0.9878 ≈1.0123.

Now, let's compute equation (2) using these γ values.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B ≈ 2 * 1.00305 + 1.0123 ≈ 2.0061 + 1.0123 ≈ 3.0184.

But according to equation (2), it should be approximately 3.0303. So, our approximation is close but not exact. So, perhaps our assumption that γ is close to 1 is not accurate enough, but maybe it's good enough for an approximate calculation.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

T_A = (γ_A - 1) m_A c².

m_A c² is 198 GeV (0.66 * 300 GeV).

So, T_A = (1.00305 - 1) * 198 GeV = 0.00305 * 198 ≈ 0.6059 GeV → 605.9 MeV.

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B -1 ) m_B c².

m_B c² is 99 GeV.

γ_B ≈ 1.0123 → T_B = 0.0123 * 99 GeV ≈ 1.2177 GeV → 1217.7 MeV.

Total KE in relativistic case: 605.9 MeV + 1217.7 MeV = 1823.6 MeV → 1.8236 GeV.

But wait, the total KE should be 3 GeV, but here it's only about 1.82 GeV. So, this suggests that our approximation is not sufficient. Thus, our assumption that γ is close to 1 is not accurate enough, and we need a better approach.

Hmm. Maybe I should approach this using the exact equations.

Let me re-express the equations.

We have:

Equation (1a): 2 γ_A β_A = γ_B β_B.

Equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

We need to solve these two equations for γ_A and γ_B.

Let me express β_A and β_B in terms of γ.

β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So, β_A = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_A²)), β_B = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_B²)).

Substituting into equation (1a):

2 γ_A sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_A²)) = γ_B sqrt(1 - 1/(γ_B²)).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

(2 γ_A)^2 (1 - 1/(γ_A²)) = γ_B^2 (1 - 1/(γ_B^2)).

Simplify:

4 γ_A² (1 - 1/γ_A²) = γ_B² (1 - 1/γ_B²).

Simplify left side:

4 γ_A² ( (γ_A² - 1)/γ_A² ) ) → 4 (γ_A² -1).

Right side: γ_B² ( (γ_B² -1)/γ_B² ) → (γ_B^4 - γ_B²)/γ_B² → (γ_B^2 -1).

So, left side = 4 (γ_A^2 -1) = right side = γ_B^2 -1.

So,

4 γ_A² -4 = γ_B² -1 → 4 γ_A² = γ_B² +3 → equation (3): γ_B² =4 γ_A² -3.

Now, from equation (2): 2 γ_A + γ_B = 3.0303.

We can express γ_B as (3.0303 - 2 γ_A).

So, γ_B = 3.0303 - 2 γ_A.

Now, substituting into equation (3):

(3.0303 - 2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A² -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 * 3.0303 * 2 γ_A + (2 γ_A)^2 = 4 γ_A^2 -3.

Compute (3.0303)^2: approx (3.03)^2 = 9.1809.

So,

9.1809 - 12.1212 γ_A +4 γ_A^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Subtract 4 γ_A^2 from both sides:

9.1809 -12.1212 γ_A = -3.

Bring all terms to left:

9.1809 +3 -12.1212 γ_A =0 → 12.1809 -12.1212 γ_A =0 → 12.1809 = 12.1212 γ_A.

So,

γ_A = 12.1809 / 12.1212 ≈ 1.005.

So, γ_A ≈ 1.005.

Then, γ_B =3.0303 -2*1.005 →3.0303 -2.010 →1.0203.

Now, check equation (3): γ_B² =4 (1.005)^2 -3.

4 * (1.005)^2 =4*(1.010025)=4.0401 → 4.0401 -3=1.0401.

γ_B² = (1.0203)^2≈1.0409.

Hmm, close but not exact. So, perhaps our approximation is not precise enough, but it's getting closer.

Now, let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute γ_A and γ_B more accurately.

We have equation (3): γ_B² =4 γ_A^2 -3.

And equation (2): γ_B = 3.0303 -2 γ_A.

Substituting into (3):

(3.0303 -2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 *3.0303 *2 γ_A + (2 γ_A)^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Which is:

9.1818 -12.1212 γ_A +4 γ_A^2 =4 γ_A^2 -3.

Cancel 4 γ_A^2 from both sides:

9.1818 -12.1212 γ_A = -3 → 9.1818 +3 =12.1212 γ_A → 12.1818 =12.1212 γ_A → γ_A =12.1818 /12.1212 ≈1.005.

So, γ_A ≈1.005.

Then, γ_B =3.0303 -2*(1.005)=3.0303 -2.010=1.0203.

Now, let's compute equation (3) precisely.

Compute 4 γ_A^2 -3 =4*(1.005)^2 -3.

1.005 squared is 1.010025. Multiply by 4:4.0401. Subtract 3:1.0401.

γ_B^2 should be (1.0203)^2 = approx 1.0409.

So, 1.0409 ≈1.0401. Close enough for an approximate solution.

So, let's proceed with these values.

Now, compute the kinetic energies:

T_A = (γ_A -1) m_A c².

m_A c² is 198 GeV.

γ_A =1.005 → γ_A -1=0.005.

So, T_A =0.005 *198 GeV=0.99 GeV =990 MeV.

Similarly, T_B = (γ_B -1) m_B c².

γ_B=1.0203 → γ_B -1=0.0203.

m_B c² is 99 GeV.

So, T_B=0.0203 *99 GeV≈2 GeV (approx 2.0097 GeV).

So, total KE is 0.99 GeV +2.0097 GeV ≈3.0 GeV, which matches.

So, in the relativistic case, T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV (1000 MeV).

So, the difference is 990 MeV -1000 MeV = -10 MeV. But wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical was 1000 MeV. The difference is -10 MeV, but since the question is about the magnitude, it's 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute. The options are in positive MeV, so the correct value is less than the classical, so the difference would be negative, but the question says "the difference between the correct value and the classical value." So, the correct is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV. The difference is -10 MeV, but the options are positive, so perhaps the answer is 10 MeV, suggesting that the correct value is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

So, correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 990 MeV - 1000 MeV = -10 MeV. But I think the problem expects the magnitude, so 10 MeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 10 MeV. So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because in the relativistic case, T1 is 990 MeV, which is less than the non-relativistic case of 1000 MeV. So, the correct value is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation. So, the difference is -10 MeV, but the question just asks for the difference, so probably 10 MeV.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \), corresponding to a rest mass \( M \).
- After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:
  - Fragment A (more massive): \( m_A = 0.66M \).
  - Fragment B (less massive): \( m_B = 0.33M \).
- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99M \), meaning \( 1\% \) of the initial rest mass is converted into kinetic energy, totaling \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma_B m_B v_B,
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( m \) is the rest mass.

2. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:
   \[
   T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV},
   \]
   where \( T_A = (\gamma_A - 1)m_A c^2 \) and \( T_B = (\gamma_B - 1)m_B c^2 \).

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case:
- Momentum conservation gives \( m_A v_A = m_B v_B \). Since \( m_A = 2m_B \), we find \( v_B = 2v_A \).
- The kinetic energy of each fragment is \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Substituting \( v_B = 2v_A \), the total kinetic energy is:
  \[
  T_A + T_B = \frac{1}{2}m_A v_A^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B (2v_A)^2 = 3m_B v_A^2.
  \]
- Using \( T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), we find \( T_A = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( T_B = 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

Thus, in the non-relativistic case, \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case:
1. Using momentum conservation and energy conservation, we solve for \( \gamma_A \) and \( \gamma_B \). After detailed calculations, we find:
   \[
   \gamma_A \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_B \approx 1.0203.
   \]
2. The kinetic energy of Fragment A is:
   \[
   T_A = (\gamma_A - 1)m_A c^2 = (1.005 - 1)(0.66 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}) = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
3. Similarly, the kinetic energy of Fragment B is:
   \[
   T_B = (\gamma_B - 1)m_B c^2 = (1.0203 - 1)(0.33 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}) \approx 2.01 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   The total kinetic energy is \( T_A + T_B = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), confirming the calculations.

Thus, in the relativistic case, \( T_1 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{non-relativistic}} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = -0.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Taking the magnitude, the difference is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) value and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.
