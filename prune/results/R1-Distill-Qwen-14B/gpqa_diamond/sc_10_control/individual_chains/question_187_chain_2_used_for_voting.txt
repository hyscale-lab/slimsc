Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

Let me start by understanding the question. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is coupled with an 8m VLT telescope at Paranal. We need to find out how many of the listed stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The options are six stars (a to f), each with different characteristics. I think the key here is understanding how the S/N ratio depends on factors like the star's brightness, distance, and other instrument parameters.

Wait, I remember that the S/N ratio for a spectrograph depends on the flux from the star. Flux is higher for brighter stars, which makes sense. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * exposure time) / (read noise + background noise). But I'm not too sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a concept where the signal increases with the square root of the exposure time and the flux.

Wait, another thought: The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a certain sensitivity. So, it can detect stars above a certain brightness. The stars' apparent magnitude will determine if ESPRESSO can get a S/N of at least 10 in an hour.

But how do I calculate the apparent magnitude of each star? I think I need to use the distance modulus formula. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me list the given stars:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with Mv=15, 10 pc
d) Same Mv=15, 200 pc
e) Same Mv=15, 5 pc
f) Same Mv=15, 50 pc

Wait, Canopus and Polaris are real stars. I should look up their absolute magnitudes to find their apparent magnitudes from Earth.

Canopus is a very bright star. I think its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.7. Since it's about 309 light-years away, that's about 94.7 parsecs. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I can calculate Canopus's distance to get its apparent magnitude.

Wait, no, maybe I should approach each star one by one.

Starting with option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is roughly -0.7. So that's very bright. With ESPRESSO, which is a high-resolution spectrograph, this brightness should make it easily detectable. Because a higher flux means higher S/N. So S/N for Canopus would definitely be above 10.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. It's a variable star, but its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. So that's brighter than most stars, but less bright than Canopus. But how does that compare to the others? Let me remember that ESPRESSO is an echelle spectrograph with high efficiency, so even a magnitude 2 star should be detectable. But I'm not sure. I'll have to think about the S/N.

Wait, the question says that the S/N should be at least 10 per binned pixel. The binned pixels probably relate to the spectrograph's resolution and the number of pixels per resolution element. But maybe that's more detailed than needed. Alternatively, perhaps the key is the star's apparent magnitude and the exposure time.

I think there's a formula that relates the S/N achieved with the exposure time, the star's magnitude, and the instrument's efficiency. Let me recall that.

The standard formula for S/N is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / sqrt(N),

where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is a reference magnitude (like a zero point), t is the exposure time, and N is the number of pixels binned. But I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Alternatively, another approach: the S/N is proportional to the square root of exposure time and inversely proportional to the square root of the number of pixels.

But perhaps I should think in terms of how the S/N scales with magnitude. Each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness. So, each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness.

The S/N scales with the square root of the flux. So, for each magnitude, the S/N increases by approximately 2.512^0.5, which is about 1.585.

Wait, but the question gives absolute magnitudes. So, to get apparent magnitude, I have to calculate using the distance modulus.

Wait, but for Canopus and Polaris, perhaps I can find their apparent magnitudes directly. Let's do that first.

Canopus:

Absolute magnitude (M) is about -5.7. Its distance is approximately 94.7 parsecs (309 light-years). So using the distance modulus:

m = M + 5 log10(d / 10)

d=94.7, so d/10 =9.47.

log10(9.47) is about 0.976.

So m = (-5.7) + 5 * 0.976 = (-5.7) + 4.88 ≈ -0.82. Which matches what I thought earlier, about -0.7 or so. So m≈-0.8.

Polaris: Absolute magnitude is about 1.7 (I might be a bit off, but let's go with that). Its distance is about 431 light-years, which is about 131 parsecs.

So m = 1.7 + 5 * log10(131/10) = 1.7 +5*log10(13.1).

log10(13.1) is about 1.117.

So 5*1.117=5.585. So m=1.7 +5.585=7.285. So m≈7.3.

So Polaris has an apparent magnitude of around 7.3, which is dimmer than the naked eye limit (which is about 6). So it's a relatively dim star, but ESPRESSO is on a large telescope, so maybe it's still detectable.

But wait, the other stars (c to f) are all Mv=15, varying distances. So let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.

Option c) distance 10 pc, Mv=15.

m = 15 +5 log10(10/10) =15 +5*0=15.

So apparent magnitude 15. That's very dim. Typically, ground-based telescopes can't see stars much fainter than about 20-25, but ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. Wait, but wait, for a 1-hour exposure, maybe.

Wait, but I'm confused. If the star is at 10 pc, Mv=15, so m=15. That's a very faint star. So the question is, can ESPRESSO get a S/N of 10 in 1 hour for such a star?

Hmm, I think the fainter the star, the lower the S/N. So for m=15, perhaps it's too faint.

I think the key is to calculate the S/N for each star, given their apparent magnitudes and the exposure time of 1 hour.

To calculate S/N, perhaps I can use the formula:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / sqrt(N),

where m0 is the zero-point magnitude of the instrument, t is exposure time in seconds, and N is the number of pixels per resolution element. But I don't know the exact values for ESPRESSO's m0 or N.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard way to estimate S/N based on magnitude and exposure time, assuming certain efficiencies.

Wait, I found a reference (in my mind) that for a typical spectrograph, a S/N of about 10 can be achieved for a star of magnitude m in t seconds of exposure with a certain formula.

Wait, another approach: the signal (proportional to flux) scales with 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

The noise is proportional to the square root of the signal.

So S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / some constant.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the S/N for a star of magnitude m observed for time t (in seconds) is approximately given by:

S/N ≈ 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * (1 / sqrt( (read noise)^2 + (background noise)^2 )) )

But without exact numbers for ESPRESSO, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the faintest star that ESPRESSO can detect.

Wait, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N for a wide range of stars, but more importantly, it's used for things like radial velocity measurements. The sensitivity depends on the star's brightness.

Looking up (but in my mind) the ESPRESSO capabilities: ESPRESSO can reach a S/N of 100 per pixel in 10 minutes for a V=8 star. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I read somewhere that ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of 100 per pixel in 1 hour for a V=10 star.

If that's the case, then a V=10 star would give S/N 100 in 1 hour. So for a V=15 star, it would be much fainter, so the S/N would be lower.

Wait, but let's think: each magnitude is about 2.5x in brightness. So from V=10 to V=15 is 5 magnitudes, which is 100x fainter. So the S/N would be sqrt(100) = 10 times lower, because S/N scales with sqrt(flux). So from 100 S/N at V=10, at V=15, S/N would be 100 / 10 = 10. Exactly what the question requires.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: If a star is 5 magnitudes fainter, it's 100 times less bright. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), so it's 10 times lower.

So for a star at V=10, S/N is 100 in 1 hour. Then a star at V=15 would have S/N 10 in 1 hour. So that's exactly the threshold.

So for the stars in options c, d, e, f, their apparent magnitudes are:

c) m=15, so S/N=10. So it's detectable. But wait, I thought that the formula I just used is based on some assumption about the zero-point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the zero-point is such that when m=15, the S/N is 10. So, yes, that's the threshold.

But let me make sure.

Wait, if m0 is the magnitude where S/N would be 100 per pixel in 1 hour, then m0 is 10. So the formula would be S/N = 100 × (10^(-0.4*(m -10))) × sqrt(t / t0), where t0 is the reference time. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but let's proceed.

If the reference is that for m=10, S/N=100 in 1 hour.

Then for m=15, S/N would be 100 * (10^(-0.4*(5))) ) = 100 * (10^-2) )= 10. So exactly 10.

So for stars dimmer than m=15, the S/N would be lower than 10, and for brighter, higher.

But wait, wait. The formula I used is S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is 10, and exposure time is 1 hour. So that would give S/N=10 at m=15.

So for the stars:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.8. So way brighter than m=10. So the S/N would be way higher than 10. Definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈7.3. So m=7.3. Let's calculate S/N.

Using the same approach:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(7.3 -10)) = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(-2.7))= 100 * 10^(1.08) ≈ 100 * 12 = 1200. So S/N is 1200, which is way above 10. So definitely detectable.

c) m=15: S/N=10. So exactly meets the criteria. So detectable.

d) m=15? Wait no, option d is Mv=15, distance 200 pc.

Wait, no, option d is Mv=15, distance 200 pc. So we have to compute m.

m = M + 5 log10(d/10)

d=200, so d/10=20.

log10(20)=1.301.

So m=15 +5*(1.301)=15+6.505=21.505.

So apparent magnitude m≈21.5. That's way beyond the reach of ESPRESSO. So S/N would be much less than 10. So not detectable.

e) Mv=15, distance 5 pc.

m =15 +5 log10(5/10)=15 +5*(-0.301)=15 -1.505=13.495.

So m≈13.5.

Using the same formula, S/N=100 *10^(-0.4*(13.5-10))=100 *10^(-0.4*3.5)=100 *10^(-1.4)≈100 *0.0398=3.98. So about 4. Which is less than 10. So not detectable.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought that m=15 gives S/N=10. So m=13.5 is brighter, which would give higher S/N. But according to the calculation, it's lower than 10.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, earlier I thought that for m=10, S/N=100 in 1 hour. So when m is brighter (lower), the S/N increases.

So for m=15, which is 5 magnitudes dimmer, the S/N is 10. For m=13.5, which is 3.5 magnitudes dimmer than m=10, let's compute.

The formula is S/N = 100 * (10^(-0.4*(m -10))).

So for m=13.5:

10^(-0.4*(3.5)) =10^(-1.4)=0.0398.

So 100 *0.0398=3.98. So about 4. That's less than 10, so not detectable.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because m=13.5 is brighter than m=15, so it's easier to get a higher S/N.

Ah, I think I might have inverted the formula. Let me think again.

The formula S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

Wait, when the star is brighter (lower m), (m - m0) is negative, so 10^(-0.4*(negative)) is 10^(positive). So S/N increases.

Wait, yes. So for m=10, which is m0, S/N=100.

For m=13.5, which is 3.5 magnitudes fainter than m=10, the S/N is 100 * (10^(-0.4*3.5)) )=100 * (10^(-1.4))≈3.98.

Which is less than 10, so not detectable. But wait, m=13.5 is brighter than m=15, which gives exactly 10. So that's confusing. So why is a brighter star (m=13.5) giving a lower S/N than a dimmer one (m=15)?

Because I think I made a mistake in how I applied the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

S/N = 100 * (10^0.4*(m0 - m)).

Because m0 is the reference magnitude, and if the star is brighter (m < m0), then (m0 - m) is positive, so S/N increases.

Let me think again.

We know that a brighter star (lower m) should have higher S/N. So the formula should reflect that.

If m0 is 10, and the star is at m=8, which is brighter, the S/N should be higher than 100.

So S/N = 100 * 10^(0.4*(10 -8)) = 100 *10^(0.8)≈100 *6.31=631.

Similarly, for m=12, which is 2 magnitudes fainter than m=10, S/N=100 *10^(-0.8)=100/6.31≈15.85.

So, the correct formula is S/N = 100 * 10^(0.4*(m0 - m)).

So in that case, for a star at m=15, S/N=100 * 10^(0.4*(10 -15))=100 *10^(-2)=10. Exactly the threshold.

For m=13.5:

S/N=100 *10^(0.4*(10-13.5))=100*10^(-1.4)=100*0.0398=3.98. So S/N≈4, which is below 10. So not detectable.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because m=13.5 is brighter than m=15. So why is its S/N lower?

Wait, no, because m=13.5 is less bright than m=10, but more bright than m=15.

Wait, no, m=13.5 is dimmer than m=10, but brighter than m=15.

Wait, no, wait. The lower the m, the brighter the star. So m=10 is brighter than m=13.5, which is brighter than m=15.

So, for m=10, S/N=100.

For m=13.5, S/N= about 15.85 (as I calculated earlier? Wait, no, earlier calculation for m=12 is 15.85. For m=13.5, the S/N is 3.98, which is lower than 10.

Wait, that can't be right. It's the same formula, but the star is dimmer than m=10, so the S/N decreases.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute:

At m=10, S/N=100.

m=13.5 is 3.5 magnitudes fainter than m=10.

Each magnitude step is a factor of 2.512 in brightness. So 3.5 mag fainter is (2.512)^3.5 ≈ (2.512^3)*(2.512^0.5)=15.848 *1.584≈25.2 (approx). So the brightness is 25 times lower.

S/N scales as sqrt(flux). So sqrt(25)=5. So the S/N should be 100 /5=20.

Wait, that doesn't match the previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S/N ∝ 10^(0.4*(m0 - m)).

Wait, when m is fainter (larger m), m0 -m is negative, so 10^(-something), which makes S/N decrease.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive the formula.

The flux from a star with apparent magnitude m is given by f = f0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where f0 is the flux at m0.

The S/N is proportional to sqrt(f * t), where t is exposure time.

Assuming that the noise is dominated by photon noise, which is proportional to sqrt(flux).

So S/N ∝ sqrt(f * t) = sqrt(t) * sqrt(f) = sqrt(t) * sqrt(f0) * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So, assuming f0 * t is such that at m=m0, S/N=100, then:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So for m=10, S/N=100.

For m=13.5:

S/N=100 *10^(-0.2*(3.5))= 100 *10^(-0.7)=100 *0.1995≈19.95. So about 20, which is above 10. So that's detectable.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, confusion arises because I'm not confident in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an approximate way.

I found a resource (in my mind) that says for a V=15 star, a 1-hour exposure with a 8m telescope would give a S/N of 10 per pixel, assuming certain conditions.

So for stars dimmer than V=15, S/N would be less than 10, so not detectable.

Brighter stars would have higher S/N.

So let's apply this:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.8. So much brighter than 15. S/N >10. Detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈7.3. Brighter than 15. So S/N >10. Detectable.

c) m=15. Exactly S/N=10. Detectable.

d) m=21.5. S/N <10. Not detectable.

e) m≈13.5. Since 13.5 <15, it's brighter, so S/N should be higher than 10. So detectable.

Wait, wait, but earlier when I applied the formula, for m=13.5, I thought S/N was 20, which is above 10.

Wait, in this case, the threshold is m=15 for S/N=10. So any star brighter than m=15 would have S/N>10, and fainter would have S/N<10.

So, for option e), m=13.5, which is brighter than 15, so S/N>10, detectable.

Similarly, option f) is Mv=15, d=50 pc.

Let's compute its m:

m =15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15 +5*0.69897=15+3.495≈18.495.

So m≈18.5. That's fainter than 15, so S/N would be less than 10. So not detectable.

Wait, but wait. No. The star's absolute magnitude is Mv=15. So the apparent magnitude m depends on distance.

So for option f), d=50 pc.

m=15 +5 log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.494≈18.494.

So m≈18.5. Which is much fainter than 15, so S/N would be less than 10. So not detectable.

So now, let's list each option:

a) Canopus: detectable (S/N>10)
b) Polaris: detectable (S/N>10)
c) m=15: detectable (S/N=10)
d) m=21.5: not detectable
e) m=13.5: detectable
f) m=18.5: not detectable

So that's a, b, c, e detectable. That's four stars.

Wait, but earlier I thought that e) is m=13.5, which is brighter than 15, so S/N>10. So it should be detectable.

So that makes four stars detectable.

But wait, earlier I thought that for m=15, S/N=10. So:

a) Canopus: yes
b) Polaris: yes
c) yes (15)
e) yes (13.5)
d) no
f) no

So that's four stars. So the answer would be C) 4.

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check each star.

Option e) is at 5 pc, Mv=15. So m=13.5. That should be detectable.

Option c) is at 10 pc, Mv=15: m=15. Exactly S/N=10. So yes.

Option e) is m=13.5: S/N=20? So detectable.

So that's four stars.

I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought that e) would have S/N=4. But perhaps my initial approach was wrong. The correct approach is to realize that any star brighter than apparent magnitude 15 would have S/N>10, so they're detectable.

So options a, b, c, e are detectable. That's four.

So the answer is C) 4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A star is considered detectable if its apparent magnitude \( m \) corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Based on ESPRESSO's sensitivity, a star with \( m = 15 \) yields an S/N of 10, and stars brighter than \( m = 15 \) (lower \( m \)) yield higher S/N, while stars fainter than \( m = 15 \) (higher \( m \)) yield lower S/N.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Canopus (a):**  
   Canopus has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.8 \), which is much brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be significantly greater than 10, making it detectable.

2. **Polaris (b):**  
   Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 7.3 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will also be significantly greater than 10, making it detectable.

3. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 5(0) = 15
   \]  
   This star has \( m = 15 \), which corresponds to an S/N of exactly 10, making it detectable.

4. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \) (d):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5(1.301) \approx 21.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be less than 10, making it undetectable.

5. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5(-0.301) \approx 13.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be greater than 10, making it detectable.

6. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \) (f):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5(0.699) \approx 18.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 18.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be less than 10, making it undetectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), the star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c), and the star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e). This gives a total of 4 detectable stars.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

Let me start by understanding the question. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is coupled with an 8m VLT telescope at Paranal. We need to find out how many of the listed stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The options are six stars (a to f), each with different characteristics. I think the key here is understanding how the S/N ratio depends on factors like the star's brightness, distance, and other instrument parameters.

Wait, I remember that the S/N ratio for a spectrograph depends on the flux from the star. Flux is higher for brighter stars, which makes sense. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * exposure time) / (read noise + background noise). But I'm not too sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a concept where the signal increases with the square root of the exposure time and the flux.

Wait, another thought: The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a certain sensitivity. So, it can detect stars above a certain brightness. The stars' apparent magnitude will determine if ESPRESSO can get a S/N of at least 10 in an hour.

But how do I calculate the apparent magnitude of each star? I think I need to use the distance modulus formula. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me list the given stars:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with Mv=15, 10 pc
d) Same Mv=15, 200 pc
e) Same Mv=15, 5 pc
f) Same Mv=15, 50 pc

Wait, Canopus and Polaris are real stars. I should look up their absolute magnitudes to find their apparent magnitudes from Earth.

Canopus is a very bright star. I think its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.7. Since it's about 309 light-years away, that's about 94.7 parsecs. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I can calculate Canopus's distance to get its apparent magnitude.

Wait, no, maybe I should approach each star one by one.

Starting with option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is roughly -0.7. So that's very bright. With ESPRESSO, which is a high-resolution spectrograph, this brightness should make it easily detectable. Because a higher flux means higher S/N. So S/N for Canopus would definitely be above 10.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. It's a variable star, but its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. So that's brighter than most stars, but less bright than Canopus. But how does that compare to the others? Let me remember that ESPRESSO is an echelle spectrograph with high efficiency, so even a magnitude 2 star should be detectable. But I'm not sure. I'll have to think about the S/N.

Wait, the question says that the S/N should be at least 10 per binned pixel. The binned pixels probably relate to the spectrograph's resolution and the number of pixels per resolution element. But maybe that's more detailed than needed. Alternatively, perhaps the key is the star's apparent magnitude and the exposure time.

I think there's a formula that relates the S/N achieved with the exposure time, the star's magnitude, and the instrument's efficiency. Let me recall that.

The standard formula for S/N is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / sqrt(N),

where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is a reference magnitude (like a zero point), t is the exposure time, and N is the number of pixels binned. But I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Alternatively, another approach: the S/N is proportional to the square root of exposure time and inversely proportional to the square root of the number of pixels.

But perhaps I should think in terms of how the S/N scales with magnitude. Each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness. So, each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness.

The S/N scales with the square root of the flux. So, for each magnitude, the S/N increases by approximately 2.512^0.5, which is about 1.585.

Wait, but the question gives absolute magnitudes. So, to get apparent magnitude, I have to calculate using the distance modulus.

Wait, but for Canopus and Polaris, perhaps I can find their apparent magnitudes directly. Let's do that first.

Canopus:

Absolute magnitude (M) is about -5.7. Its distance is approximately 94.7 parsecs (309 light-years). So using the distance modulus:

m = M + 5 log10(d / 10)

d=94.7, so d/10 =9.47.

log10(9.47) is about 0.976.

So m = (-5.7) + 5 * 0.976 = (-5.7) + 4.88 ≈ -0.82. Which matches what I thought earlier, about -0.7 or so. So m≈-0.8.

Polaris: Absolute magnitude is about 1.7 (I might be a bit off, but let's go with that). Its distance is about 431 light-years, which is about 131 parsecs.

So m = 1.7 + 5 * log10(131/10) = 1.7 +5*log10(13.1).

log10(13.1) is about 1.117.

So 5*1.117=5.585. So m=1.7 +5.585=7.285. So m≈7.3.

So Polaris has an apparent magnitude of around 7.3, which is dimmer than the naked eye limit (which is about 6). So it's a relatively dim star, but ESPRESSO is on a large telescope, so maybe it's still detectable.

But wait, the other stars (c to f) are all Mv=15, varying distances. So let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.

Option c) distance 10 pc, Mv=15.

m = 15 +5 log10(10/10) =15 +5*0=15.

So apparent magnitude 15. That's very dim. Typically, ground-based telescopes can't see stars much fainter than about 20-25, but ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. Wait, but wait, for a 1-hour exposure, maybe.

Wait, but I'm confused. If the star is at 10 pc, Mv=15, so m=15. That's a very faint star. So the question is, can ESPRESSO get a S/N of 10 in 1 hour for such a star?

Hmm, I think the fainter the star, the lower the S/N. So for m=15, perhaps it's too faint.

I think the key is to calculate the S/N for each star, given their apparent magnitudes and the exposure time of 1 hour.

To calculate S/N, perhaps I can use the formula:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / sqrt(N),

where m0 is the zero-point magnitude of the instrument, t is exposure time in seconds, and N is the number of pixels per resolution element. But I don't know the exact values for ESPRESSO's m0 or N.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard way to estimate S/N based on magnitude and exposure time, assuming certain efficiencies.

Wait, I found a reference (in my mind) that for a typical spectrograph, a S/N of about 10 can be achieved for a star of magnitude m in t seconds of exposure with a certain formula.

Wait, another approach: the signal (proportional to flux) scales with 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

The noise is proportional to the square root of the signal.

So S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / some constant.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the S/N for a star of magnitude m observed for time t (in seconds) is approximately given by:

S/N ≈ 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * (1 / sqrt( (read noise)^2 + (background noise)^2 )) )

But without exact numbers for ESPRESSO, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the faintest star that ESPRESSO can detect.

Wait, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N for a wide range of stars, but more importantly, it's used for things like radial velocity measurements. The sensitivity depends on the star's brightness.

Looking up (but in my mind) the ESPRESSO capabilities: ESPRESSO can reach a S/N of 100 per pixel in 10 minutes for a V=8 star. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I read somewhere that ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of 100 per pixel in 1 hour for a V=10 star.

If that's the case, then a V=10 star would give S/N 100 in 1 hour. So for a V=15 star, it would be much fainter, so the S/N would be lower.

Wait, but let's think: each magnitude is about 2.5x in brightness. So from V=10 to V=15 is 5 magnitudes, which is 100x fainter. So the S/N would be sqrt(100) = 10 times lower, because S/N scales with sqrt(flux). So from 100 S/N at V=10, at V=15, S/N would be 100 / 10 = 10. Exactly what the question requires.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: If a star is 5 magnitudes fainter, it's 100 times less bright. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), so it's 10 times lower.

So for a star at V=10, S/N is 100 in 1 hour. Then a star at V=15 would have S/N 10 in 1 hour. So that's exactly the threshold.

So for the stars in options c, d, e, f, their apparent magnitudes are:

c) m=15, so S/N=10. So it's detectable. But wait, I thought that the formula I just used is based on some assumption about the zero-point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the zero-point is such that when m=15, the S/N is 10. So, yes, that's the threshold.

But let me make sure.

Wait, if m0 is the magnitude where S/N would be 100 per pixel in 1 hour, then m0 is 10. So the formula would be S/N = 100 × (10^(-0.4*(m -10))) × sqrt(t / t0), where t0 is the reference time. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but let's proceed.

If the reference is that for m=10, S/N=100 in 1 hour.

Then for m=15, S/N would be 100 * (10^(-0.4*(5))) ) = 100 * (10^-2) )= 10. So exactly 10.

So for stars dimmer than m=15, the S/N would be lower than 10, and for brighter, higher.

But wait, wait. The formula I used is S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is 10, and exposure time is 1 hour. So that would give S/N=10 at m=15.

So for the stars:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.8. So way brighter than m=10. So the S/N would be way higher than 10. Definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈7.3. So m=7.3. Let's calculate S/N.

Using the same approach:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(7.3 -10)) = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(-2.7))= 100 * 10^(1.08) ≈ 100 * 12 = 1200. So S/N is 1200, which is way above 10. So definitely detectable.

c) m=15: S/N=10. So exactly meets the criteria. So detectable.

d) m=15? Wait no, option d is Mv=15, distance 200 pc.

Wait, no, option d is Mv=15, distance 200 pc. So we have to compute m.

m = M + 5 log10(d/10)

d=200, so d/10=20.

log10(20)=1.301.

So m=15 +5*(1.301)=15+6.505=21.505.

So apparent magnitude m≈21.5. That's way beyond the reach of ESPRESSO. So S/N would be much less than 10. So not detectable.

e) Mv=15, distance 5 pc.

m =15 +5 log10(5/10)=15 +5*(-0.301)=15 -1.505=13.495.

So m≈13.5.

Using the same formula, S/N=100 *10^(-0.4*(13.5-10))=100 *10^(-0.4*3.5)=100 *10^(-1.4)≈100 *0.0398=3.98. So about 4. Which is less than 10. So not detectable.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought that m=15 gives S/N=10. So m=13.5 is brighter, which would give higher S/N. But according to the calculation, it's lower than 10.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, earlier I thought that for m=10, S/N=100 in 1 hour. So when m is brighter (lower), the S/N increases.

So for m=15, which is 5 magnitudes dimmer, the S/N is 10. For m=13.5, which is 3.5 magnitudes dimmer than m=10, let's compute.

The formula is S/N = 100 * (10^(-0.4*(m -10))).

So for m=13.5:

10^(-0.4*(3.5)) =10^(-1.4)=0.0398.

So 100 *0.0398=3.98. So about 4. That's less than 10, so not detectable.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because m=13.5 is brighter than m=15, so it's easier to get a higher S/N.

Ah, I think I might have inverted the formula. Let me think again.

The formula S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

Wait, when the star is brighter (lower m), (m - m0) is negative, so 10^(-0.4*(negative)) is 10^(positive). So S/N increases.

Wait, yes. So for m=10, which is m0, S/N=100.

For m=13.5, which is 3.5 magnitudes fainter than m=10, the S/N is 100 * (10^(-0.4*3.5)) )=100 * (10^(-1.4))≈3.98.

Which is less than 10, so not detectable. But wait, m=13.5 is brighter than m=15, which gives exactly 10. So that's confusing. So why is a brighter star (m=13.5) giving a lower S/N than a dimmer one (m=15)?

Because I think I made a mistake in how I applied the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

S/N = 100 * (10^0.4*(m0 - m)).

Because m0 is the reference magnitude, and if the star is brighter (m < m0), then (m0 - m) is positive, so S/N increases.

Let me think again.

We know that a brighter star (lower m) should have higher S/N. So the formula should reflect that.

If m0 is 10, and the star is at m=8, which is brighter, the S/N should be higher than 100.

So S/N = 100 * 10^(0.4*(10 -8)) = 100 *10^(0.8)≈100 *6.31=631.

Similarly, for m=12, which is 2 magnitudes fainter than m=10, S/N=100 *10^(-0.8)=100/6.31≈15.85.

So, the correct formula is S/N = 100 * 10^(0.4*(m0 - m)).

So in that case, for a star at m=15, S/N=100 * 10^(0.4*(10 -15))=100 *10^(-2)=10. Exactly the threshold.

For m=13.5:

S/N=100 *10^(0.4*(10-13.5))=100*10^(-1.4)=100*0.0398=3.98. So S/N≈4, which is below 10. So not detectable.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because m=13.5 is brighter than m=15. So why is its S/N lower?

Wait, no, because m=13.5 is less bright than m=10, but more bright than m=15.

Wait, no, m=13.5 is dimmer than m=10, but brighter than m=15.

Wait, no, wait. The lower the m, the brighter the star. So m=10 is brighter than m=13.5, which is brighter than m=15.

So, for m=10, S/N=100.

For m=13.5, S/N= about 15.85 (as I calculated earlier? Wait, no, earlier calculation for m=12 is 15.85. For m=13.5, the S/N is 3.98, which is lower than 10.

Wait, that can't be right. It's the same formula, but the star is dimmer than m=10, so the S/N decreases.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute:

At m=10, S/N=100.

m=13.5 is 3.5 magnitudes fainter than m=10.

Each magnitude step is a factor of 2.512 in brightness. So 3.5 mag fainter is (2.512)^3.5 ≈ (2.512^3)*(2.512^0.5)=15.848 *1.584≈25.2 (approx). So the brightness is 25 times lower.

S/N scales as sqrt(flux). So sqrt(25)=5. So the S/N should be 100 /5=20.

Wait, that doesn't match the previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S/N ∝ 10^(0.4*(m0 - m)).

Wait, when m is fainter (larger m), m0 -m is negative, so 10^(-something), which makes S/N decrease.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive the formula.

The flux from a star with apparent magnitude m is given by f = f0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where f0 is the flux at m0.

The S/N is proportional to sqrt(f * t), where t is exposure time.

Assuming that the noise is dominated by photon noise, which is proportional to sqrt(flux).

So S/N ∝ sqrt(f * t) = sqrt(t) * sqrt(f) = sqrt(t) * sqrt(f0) * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So, assuming f0 * t is such that at m=m0, S/N=100, then:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So for m=10, S/N=100.

For m=13.5:

S/N=100 *10^(-0.2*(3.5))= 100 *10^(-0.7)=100 *0.1995≈19.95. So about 20, which is above 10. So that's detectable.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, confusion arises because I'm not confident in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an approximate way.

I found a resource (in my mind) that says for a V=15 star, a 1-hour exposure with a 8m telescope would give a S/N of 10 per pixel, assuming certain conditions.

So for stars dimmer than V=15, S/N would be less than 10, so not detectable.

Brighter stars would have higher S/N.

So let's apply this:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.8. So much brighter than 15. S/N >10. Detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈7.3. Brighter than 15. So S/N >10. Detectable.

c) m=15. Exactly S/N=10. Detectable.

d) m=21.5. S/N <10. Not detectable.

e) m≈13.5. Since 13.5 <15, it's brighter, so S/N should be higher than 10. So detectable.

Wait, wait, but earlier when I applied the formula, for m=13.5, I thought S/N was 20, which is above 10.

Wait, in this case, the threshold is m=15 for S/N=10. So any star brighter than m=15 would have S/N>10, and fainter would have S/N<10.

So, for option e), m=13.5, which is brighter than 15, so S/N>10, detectable.

Similarly, option f) is Mv=15, d=50 pc.

Let's compute its m:

m =15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15 +5*0.69897=15+3.495≈18.495.

So m≈18.5. That's fainter than 15, so S/N would be less than 10. So not detectable.

Wait, but wait. No. The star's absolute magnitude is Mv=15. So the apparent magnitude m depends on distance.

So for option f), d=50 pc.

m=15 +5 log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.494≈18.494.

So m≈18.5. Which is much fainter than 15, so S/N would be less than 10. So not detectable.

So now, let's list each option:

a) Canopus: detectable (S/N>10)
b) Polaris: detectable (S/N>10)
c) m=15: detectable (S/N=10)
d) m=21.5: not detectable
e) m=13.5: detectable
f) m=18.5: not detectable

So that's a, b, c, e detectable. That's four stars.

Wait, but earlier I thought that e) is m=13.5, which is brighter than 15, so S/N>10. So it should be detectable.

So that makes four stars detectable.

But wait, earlier I thought that for m=15, S/N=10. So:

a) Canopus: yes
b) Polaris: yes
c) yes (15)
e) yes (13.5)
d) no
f) no

So that's four stars. So the answer would be C) 4.

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check each star.

Option e) is at 5 pc, Mv=15. So m=13.5. That should be detectable.

Option c) is at 10 pc, Mv=15: m=15. Exactly S/N=10. So yes.

Option e) is m=13.5: S/N=20? So detectable.

So that's four stars.

I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought that e) would have S/N=4. But perhaps my initial approach was wrong. The correct approach is to realize that any star brighter than apparent magnitude 15 would have S/N>10, so they're detectable.

So options a, b, c, e are detectable. That's four.

So the answer is C) 4.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A star is considered detectable if its apparent magnitude \( m \) corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Based on ESPRESSO's sensitivity, a star with \( m = 15 \) yields an S/N of 10, and stars brighter than \( m = 15 \) (lower \( m \)) yield higher S/N, while stars fainter than \( m = 15 \) (higher \( m \)) yield lower S/N.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Canopus (a):**  
   Canopus has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.8 \), which is much brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be significantly greater than 10, making it detectable.

2. **Polaris (b):**  
   Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 7.3 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will also be significantly greater than 10, making it detectable.

3. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 5(0) = 15
   \]  
   This star has \( m = 15 \), which corresponds to an S/N of exactly 10, making it detectable.

4. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \) (d):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5(1.301) \approx 21.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be less than 10, making it undetectable.

5. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5(-0.301) \approx 13.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be greater than 10, making it detectable.

6. **Star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \) (f):**  
   Using the distance modulus formula:  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5(0.699) \approx 18.5
   \]  
   This star has \( m \approx 18.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N will be less than 10, making it undetectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), the star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c), and the star with \( M_v = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e). This gives a total of 4 detectable stars.

**Answer: C**
