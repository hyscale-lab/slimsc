Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So this would be a two-component vector. The first component is 3i, and the second is 4. So the vector is [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ħ ψ, where ψ is the spinor, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, because the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, so S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y. Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, and since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, it's the same as (ħ/2) times ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩. So I can factor that out.

So first, I need to compute the matrix product σ_y multiplied by the state vector, then take the inner product with the conjugate transpose of the state vector.

Let me write down σ_y again to make sure I have it right. The Pauli Y matrix is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So when I apply σ_y to the state vector ψ = [3i; 4], I do the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let's denote ψ as a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4]. Let's compute σ_y * ψ.

First row of σ_y is [0, -i]. Multiply by ψ:

(0)*3i + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second row of σ_y is [i, 0]. Multiply by ψ:

i * 3i + 0 *4 = 3i². Since i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ equals [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of ψ, which is ψ†. The original ψ is [3i;4], so the conjugate is [-3i; 4]. The transpose would be a row vector: [-3i, 4].

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, because (3i)* = 3*(-i) = -3i. And the conjugate of 4 is 4, since it's real. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the inner product ψ† (σ_y ψ) is the dot product of [-3i, 4] with [ -4i, -3 ].

So compute each component:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So adding them together: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck that calculation. Oh, because when I multiply the first components:

(-3i) * (-4i) = (12)(i^2) = (12)(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

But wait, that's the result of ψ† σ_y ψ. But remember that the expectation value is (ħ/2) times this. Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -12 ħ. Let me check the options again:

Option A) -12 hbar/25

Option B) 12 hbar/25

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculation. Let me go through it again step by step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the application of σ_y to ψ.

Let me recompute σ_y * ψ.

ψ is [3i; 4].

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So first component: 0 * (3i) + (-i) * 4 = 0 -4i.

Second component: i *3i + 0 *4 = 3i² +0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So:

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² = -12.

4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the product is -24.

Wait, but the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in the application of the operator or in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the state is given as (3i,4), but in what basis? Oh, wait, the spin state is a two-component vector, so perhaps I should normalize it first?

Wait, right. The state vector should be normalized. So first, let's compute the norm of ψ.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2. |3i|=3, so (3)^2 +4^2=9+16=25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). So I should have used the normalized state, not the original.

Ah, that's the mistake! I forgot to normalize the state vector. So the correct ψ is [3i/5; 4/5].

So let me re-do the calculation with the normalized state.

ψ = [3i/(5); 4/(5)].

Compute σ_y ψ:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y ψ is [ (-4i/5); (-3/5) ].

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. So ψ is [3i/5, 4/5]^T. So ψ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding these: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-24)/25.

Then the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A: -12*hbar/25.

So the correct answer should be A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

   The norm of the state is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Pauli matrix for \( S_y \)**:  
   The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is given as:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to \( \sigma_y \) as:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
   \]

3. **Matrix multiplication \( \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   Applying \( \sigma_y \) to the normalized state \( \psi \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Conjugate transpose \( \psi^\dagger \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Inner product \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \)**:  
   Compute the inner product:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   First term:  
   \[
   -\frac{3i}{5} \cdot -\frac{4i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}.
   \]  
   Second term:  
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \cdot -\frac{3}{5} = -\frac{12}{25}.
   \]  
   Adding the terms:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \)**:  
   The expectation value is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left( -\frac{24}{25} \right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Matching with options**:  
   The result matches option **A**: \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \).

Second row of σ_y is [i, 0]. Multiply by ψ:

i * 3i + 0 *4 = 3i². Since i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ equals [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of ψ, which is ψ†. The original ψ is [3i;4], so the conjugate is [-3i; 4]. The transpose would be a row vector: [-3i, 4].

So compute each component:

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So:

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² = -12.

4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the product is -24.
