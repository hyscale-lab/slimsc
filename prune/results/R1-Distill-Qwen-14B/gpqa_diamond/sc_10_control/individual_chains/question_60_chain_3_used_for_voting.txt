Okay, so I've got this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. So the question is about an astronaut traveling at a very high speed, and we need to figure out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to c, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here. Time dilation, right? From the astronaut's point of view, the trip should take less time because of the effects of relativity.

So, the problem gives the astronaut's age as 22 years, but the question is about how long the trip takes for them. The options suggest it's either around 70-something years or that they die before getting there.

Wait, but I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame.

I remember the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where Δt is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, actually, the formula is Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, we need to figure out what Δt is first, which is the time it takes to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth as measured in Earth's frame, and then apply the Lorentz factor to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, no. The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a real thing. I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So, in Earth's frame, the distance is 163,000 light-years. The spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time it takes, Δt, would be the distance divided by speed.

Let me compute that. So Δt = distance / speed. The distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so the denominator is almost 1. So 163000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163000 * (1 - 0.13e-6) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of approximation. Since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. Oh wait, because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7, approximately. So 1/(1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7. So 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + 163000 * 1.3e-7.

163000 * 1.3e-7 is about 163000 * 1.3e-7. Let's compute that: 163000 * 1.3 = 211900. Then 211900e-7 is 0.02119 years. So Δt is approximately 163000.02119 years. So about 163,000 years from Earth's frame.

Wait, but that can't be right because the astronaut's lifetime is only 150 years. Oh wait, no, the astronaut's age is 22, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So from their perspective, they can live up to 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 163,000 years from Earth's perspective, but much less from the astronaut's, but would that make the astronaut's experienced time more than 150 years?

Wait, but wait, the spaceship is moving at such a high speed that from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. Oh right! Because in the astronaut's frame, Earth and the LMC are moving towards them at 0.99999987c, so the distance between them is contracted.

So the distance in the spaceship's frame is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper distance (Earth's frame). So L is the contracted length.

So, the time experienced by the astronaut, Δt', is L / v. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching at v, and distance is L.

So let me compute L first.

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). L0 is 163,000 light-years.

v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² is about 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4. Because 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7.

So L ≈ 163000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ Let's compute that.

163000 * 5e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. 163000 * 1e-4 is 16.3, so 0.0005 is half that, 8.15. Wait no, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, 5.1e-4 is 0.00051.

So 163000 * 0.00051 = let's compute 163000 * 5.1e-4.

163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00001 = 1.63.

So 81.5 + 1.63 * 0.51? Wait, no, 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.000001. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 163000 * 0.00051 = (163000 * 51) * 1e-6.

163000 * 51 = 163000 * 50 is 8,150,000, plus 163000 *1 is 163,000. So total 8,313,000. Then times 1e-6 is 8.313.

So L ≈ 8.313 light-years.

Wait, that's a much shorter distance in the astronaut's frame. So the time for the trip is L divided by v. v is 0.99999987 c. So time Δt' is (8.313 ly) / (0.99999987 c) years.

Wait, because light-year is distance, and v is in terms of c. So 1 ly / (0.99999987 c) is approximately (1 / 0.99999987) years. Since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1.00000013. So 8.313 * 1.00000013 ≈ 8.313 years.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. Wait a second, no. Because in the astronaut's frame, the distance is 8.313 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c, so the time taken is (8.313 ly) / (0.99999987 c) = 8.313 / 0.99999987 years. Since 0.99999987 is almost 1, this is approximately 8.313 * 1.00000013 ≈ 8.313 + 0.0000083 ≈ 8.313 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 8.3 years on the trip. But wait, that's not matching the options. The options are in the 70s and 80s. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the distance. Let me double-check. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. So L0 is 163,000 ly. Then L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So yes, 163,000 * 5.1e-4 is about 83 years. Wait, no, 163,000 * 5.1e-4 is 81.33 years? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 163,000 * 0.00051 is 163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, plus 163,000 * 0.00001 is 1.63. So 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 light-years? No, that can't be. Wait, no, 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.000001. So 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63. So 81.5 + 0.000001 * 163,000 = 81.5 + 0.163 = 81.663.

Wait, I'm getting 81.663 light-years as the contracted distance.

Wait, then the time is L / v. So 81.663 ly divided by 0.99999987 c. Because 1 ly / c is 1 year, so 81.663 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.663 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81.663 + 0.000108 ≈ 81.663 years.

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old, so upon arrival, they would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old. Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years, so they would reach Earth before dying.

But wait, the options don't have 81.6. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.
B) 72 years
C) 81 years
D) 77 years

Wait, option C is 81 years, which is close to what I calculated.

But wait, I thought the trip time from the astronaut's perspective would be about 8 years, but that's not matching. Wait, no, I'm getting 81 years now. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the contracted distance.

Wait, wait, let's re-calculate L. L0 is 163,000 ly.

v is 0.99999987c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta is v/c.

So beta is 0.99999987.

So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - beta^2 is 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 163000 * 5.099e-4.

Let me compute 163000 * 5.099e-4.

5.099e-4 is 0.0005099.

163000 * 0.0005099 = ?

Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000099 = 1.6177.

So total is 81.5 + 1.6177 ≈ 83.1177 light-years.

Wait, so L is about 83.12 ly.

Then time is L / v.

v is 0.99999987c.

So time is (83.12 ly) / (0.99999987 c) = 83.12 / 0.99999987 years.

Since 0.99999987 ≈ 1, 83.12 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.12 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.12 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.12 years.

So the trip takes about 83 years from the astronaut's perspective. But the options don't have 83. Closest is option C) 81 years, which is a bit lower. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps my initial approximation for sqrt(1 - v^2) was a bit off.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2 = 0.9999997408 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0000002592.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.0000002592) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. 0.0000002592 is 2.592e-7.

What's the square root of 2.592e-7?

Well, sqrt(2.592) is about 1.6099. Because 1.6^2=2.56, 1.61^2=2.5921.

So sqrt(2.592e-7) is approximately 1.6099e-3.5? Wait, no, 2.592e-7 is 2.592 * 1e-7.

Wait, sqrt(2.592) is about 1.6099, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 which is 3.16e-4. Wait, no, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.16e-4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * sqrt(1e-7) ) = 1.6099 * 3.1623e-4.

So 1.6099 * 3.1623e-4 = approx 5.093e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 5.093e-4.

So L = 163000 * 5.093e-4.

Compute 163000 * 5.093e-4.

Which is 163000 * 0.0005093.

Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000093 = 1.5159.

Adding together: 81.5 + 1.5159 = 83.0159 ly.

So L is 83.0159 ly.

Time is 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.0159 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 83.0159 + 83.0159 * 1.3e-7.

83.0159 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 1.079e-5 years, which is about 3.91 hours, negligible.

So the time is approximately 83.016 years. Hmm, but the options don't have 83. The closest is option C:81 years. Did I make a mistake in the distance?

Wait, perhaps the distance is not 163,000 light-years. Let me think, the actual distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. So perhaps using 163,000 ly is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach, perhaps using the time experienced by the astronaut without considering the contracted distance.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut can be calculated using the time dilation formula, but using the Earth's frame time.

Wait, from Earth's frame, the time taken is 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

So from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 163,000 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the time is less due to time dilation. So Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So Δt' = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Which is 163,000 * sqrt(2.592e-7) ≈ 163,000 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 83.016 years.

Which is what I got earlier.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, or A (die before arrival).

But the astronaut is 22 years old. If the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so they would survive.

So the correct answer would be an experienced time of about 83 years. But the options don't have 83. The closest is C)81.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for the Lorentz factor.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the approximation for v ≈ c, where sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 - v^2/(2c^2).

Wait, let's compute it that way.

Using the approximation:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 - (v^2)/(2 c^2) for v close to c.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2 ≈ (0.99999974) c^2.

So (v^2)/(2 c^2) = 0.99999974 / 2 ≈ 0.49999987.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, v is 0.99999987 c, so v^2 is (0.99999987)^2 c^2 = (approx) 0.99999974 c^2.

So (v^2)/(2 c^2) is 0.99999974 / 2 ≈ 0.49999987. So 1 - (v^2)/(2 c^2) = 1 - 0.49999987 = 0.50000013.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 0.50000013.

So L is 163000 ly * 0.50000013 ≈81,500.0219 ly.

Wait, so L is about 81,500 ly.

Then, time is 81,500 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81,500 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81,500.108 years.

Wait, that's 81,500 years, which can't be right because from the Earth's frame, the trip is only 163,000 years. But using the approximation, I'm getting a longer time.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the gamma factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1/(5.093e-4) ≈ 1962. So gamma is around 1962.

So from Earth's frame, the time is 163000 years. From the astronaut's frame, the time is Earth's time divided by gamma.

So Δt' = Δt / gamma = 163000 / 1962 ≈ 83 years.

Which brings us back to the same number as before, 83 years. But the options don't have that.

So in the options, the closest is C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 170,000 light-years. Let me recalculate with that.

But the problem says Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 160,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that at v = 0.99999987c, the Lorentz factor gamma is about 220.

Wait, let me compute gamma accurately.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

We have v = 0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

1 - v^2 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v^2) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961. So about 1961.

So time experienced is 163000 / 1961 ≈ 83 years.

Hmm. So why is 83 not an option? The options are 72, 77, 81, or die.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the contracted distance. Let me compute it again.

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163000 * 5.093e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005093.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

Compute 163000 * 0.0000093 = 1.5159.

Adding them gives 83.0159 ly.

So time is 83.0159 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.0159 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.0159 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.016 years.

So 83 years. But options don't have 83. Closest is 81, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without approximations.

Let me compute (1 - v^2/c^2) precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997408801 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997408801 = 0.0000002591199.

sqrt(0.0000002591199) = approximately 0.00050903.

So L = 163000 * 0.00050903 ≈ 163000 * 0.00050903.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00000903 = 163000 * 9.03e-6.

163000 * 9.03e-6 = 163000 * 0.00000903 ≈ 1.4739.

So L = 81.5 + 1.4739 ≈ 82.9739 ly.

Time is 82.9739 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.9739 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.9739 + 0.000108 ≈ 82.9748 years.

So approximately 83 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the time is calculated using the Earth's frame or the astronaut's frame. Let's think — the question asks how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. So the correct approach is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Proper time is given by tau = delta_t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no, proper time is calculated in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) occur at the same place. But in this case, the astronaut is moving, so the Earth is moving relative to them.

Alternatively, the time experienced by the astronaut can be found using the Lorentz transformation for time.

But perhaps a better way is to use the formula for proper time:

tau = delta_t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Where delta_t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, which is 163,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7 ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

Then tau = 163000.021 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163000.021 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 83 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years.

But again, the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years, which is the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for v.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that for v ≈ c, the time experienced is approximately distance / c.

Because when v is almost c, the time in the astronaut's frame is roughly L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) / v.

But wait, L0 is 163000 ly, v is 0.99999987c.

So L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = L0 * sqrt( (1 - v)(1 + v) ) ≈ L0 * (1 - v/2), assuming v is close to c.

Wait, perhaps this is a better approximation.

Let me think. When v is very close to c, 1 - v^2/c^2 = (1 - v)(1 + v) ≈ (1 - v) since (1 + v) ≈ 2.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ sqrt(2(1 - v)).

But when v is 0.99999987 c,

1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013.

So sqrt(2 * 0.00000013) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

Which is what I had before.

So perhaps the approximation isn't getting us anywhere. The calculation consistently gives about 83 years.

Since the options don't have 83, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time from Earth's perspective, but that can't be because the options are in the 70s and 80s, which would make the astronaut's age way beyond their average lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the time dilation using only the Lorentz factor without considering the contraction. Let me think, if the spaceship takes 163000 years from Earth's frame, then the astronaut's time would be 163000 / gamma, where gamma is 1961.

163000 / 1961 ≈ 83 years.

Which brings me back to the same conclusion.

But the options don't have 83. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption about the distance. The LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Maybe the problem uses a different figure, like 170,000 ly.

Let me recalculate with 170,000 ly.

L = 170,000 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 86.581 ly.

Time is 86.581 / 0.99999987 ≈ 86.58 years.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the correct answer is 83 years, but the closest option is C)81. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Lorentz factor.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of v is 0.99999987 c, so when I compute beta squared:

beta = 0.99999987.

beta squared is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997408801.

So 1 - beta squared is 0.0000002591199.

The square root of that is sqrt(2.591199e-7) ≈ 5.0903e-4.

So L = 163,000 * 5.0903e-4 = 163,000 * 0.00050903 ≈ 83.0159 ly.

So time is 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.016 years.

Hmm.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 81 years, considering a more approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old. So if the trip takes about 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 +83 = 105 years old, which is less than 150, so they would survive.

But option A says they die before reaching. So option A is not correct.

Looking at the options, the only one close to my calculation is C) 81 years, but I'm getting 83. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation and expects the answer 72 years.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, let me compute 163000 * 0.00050903.

Let me compute 163000 * 0.00050903.

163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00000903 = 163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467.

Plus 163000 * 0.00000003 = 0.00489.

So 1.467 + 0.00489 = 1.47189.

So total L = 81.5 + 1.47189 = 82.97189 ≈ 82.97 ly.

Time is 82.97 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.97 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.97 + (82.97 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 82.97 + 0.0000108 ≈ 82.97 years.

So approximately 83 years.

So the correct answer, based on the calculation, is about 83 years, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact distance and uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the time from the astronaut's perspective is calculated using the reciprocal of gamma multiplied by the time from Earth's perspective.

Wait, no, because time dilation says that the moving clock runs slower. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is running slow. But from the astronaut's frame, Earth's clock is running slow.

But the proper time is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the Earth's frame time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, for Earth's frame, time is 163000 years. So the astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(0.000000259) ≈163000 * 5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the velocity in the Lorentz factor differently. I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the approximation where for v ≈ c, the time experienced is L0 / (gamma * c).

Wait, L0 is 163000 ly.

gamma is 1962.

So L0 / (gamma c) = (163000 ly) / (1962 * c) = (163000 / 1962) * (ly / c) ) = (83.016) * 1 year = 83.016 years.

Same result.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years, considering the problem might have used a slightly different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the contraction and use the time from Earth's frame multiplied by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Earth's frame time is 163000 years. So the astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * 5.09e-4 = 83 years.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using v = 0.99999987c and considering the time as (distance) / (v), where distance is 163,000 ly, but that would give 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈163,000 years, which is way too long.

But no, because that's the time from Earth's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into using the time from Earth's frame and applying the Lorentz factor incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the time using the equation t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, because t is 163000, and t' is 83.

But again, the options don't have 83.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the twin paradox. In the twin paradox, the traveling twin ages less than the stay-at-home twin.

In this case, the Earth twin would age 163,000 years, while the astronaut ages 83 years.

So the astronaut would be 83 years old upon arrival, which is less than their average lifetime of 150, so they would survive.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81 years, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation where sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is approximated as 0.5.

In that case, L = 163000 * 0.5 =81500 ly.

Time would be 81500 / 0.99999987 ≈81500 *1.00000013≈81500 years. That can't be right.

Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the time from the astronaut's perspective to be (distance in their frame) / (v). Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the formula for time as Δt = (distance) / (v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no, that would be (163000 ly / (0.99999987c)) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (163000 * 1.00000013) * 5.09e-4 ≈163000 *5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Same result.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, the closest is C)81 years. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use v= 0.99999987c and gamma as 220, leading to a time of 74 years, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Wait, no, light-years and years cancel correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. For example, if the distance is 77,000 light-years, the time would be 77,000 *0.5e-3=38.5 years, but that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time using only the time dilation formula and not the contraction, which would be wrong, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

Wait, that would be:

From Earth's frame, time is 163000 years.

Astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163000 *5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Same as before.

Thus, I'm confident the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since it's not an option, I'm forced to choose the closest option, which is C)81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation and length contraction principles. The spaceship travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( L_0 = 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Length Contraction**:  
   In the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.093 \times 10^{-4}
   \]
   \[
   L = 163,000 \times 5.093 \times 10^{-4} \approx 83.016 \, \text{light-years}.
   \]

2. **Time Experienced by the Astronaut**:  
   The time experienced by the astronaut is the contracted distance divided by the spaceship's speed:
   \[
   \Delta t' = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{83.016 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}.
   \]
   Since \( 1 \, \text{light-year} / c = 1 \, \text{year} \), we approximate:
   \[
   \Delta t' \approx 83.016 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated time of approximately \( 83 \, \text{years} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 81 years**. This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately \( 83 \, \text{years} \) during the journey, but since this value is not listed, the best match is **C) 81 years**. Additionally, the astronaut's average lifetime of \( 150 \, \text{years} \) ensures they will survive the trip.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. So the question is about an astronaut traveling at a very high speed, and we need to figure out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to c, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here. Time dilation, right? From the astronaut's point of view, the trip should take less time because of the effects of relativity.

So, the problem gives the astronaut's age as 22 years, but the question is about how long the trip takes for them. The options suggest it's either around 70-something years or that they die before getting there.

Wait, but I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame.

I remember the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where Δt is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, actually, the formula is Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, we need to figure out what Δt is first, which is the time it takes to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth as measured in Earth's frame, and then apply the Lorentz factor to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, no. The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a real thing. I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So, in Earth's frame, the distance is 163,000 light-years. The spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time it takes, Δt, would be the distance divided by speed.

Let me compute that. So Δt = distance / speed. The distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so the denominator is almost 1. So 163000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163000 * (1 - 0.13e-6) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of approximation. Since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. Oh wait, because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7, approximately. So 1/(1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7. So 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + 163000 * 1.3e-7.

163000 * 1.3e-7 is about 163000 * 1.3e-7. Let's compute that: 163000 * 1.3 = 211900. Then 211900e-7 is 0.02119 years. So Δt is approximately 163000.02119 years. So about 163,000 years from Earth's frame.

Wait, but that can't be right because the astronaut's lifetime is only 150 years. Oh wait, no, the astronaut's age is 22, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So from their perspective, they can live up to 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 163,000 years from Earth's perspective, but much less from the astronaut's, but would that make the astronaut's experienced time more than 150 years?

Wait, but wait, the spaceship is moving at such a high speed that from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. Oh right! Because in the astronaut's frame, Earth and the LMC are moving towards them at 0.99999987c, so the distance between them is contracted.

So the distance in the spaceship's frame is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper distance (Earth's frame). So L is the contracted length.

So, the time experienced by the astronaut, Δt', is L / v. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching at v, and distance is L.

So let me compute L first.

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). L0 is 163,000 light-years.

v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² is about 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4. Because 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7.

So L ≈ 163000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ Let's compute that.

163000 * 5e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. 163000 * 1e-4 is 16.3, so 0.0005 is half that, 8.15. Wait no, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, 5.1e-4 is 0.00051.

So 163000 * 0.00051 = let's compute 163000 * 5.1e-4.

163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00001 = 1.63.

So 81.5 + 1.63 * 0.51? Wait, no, 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.000001. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 163000 * 0.00051 = (163000 * 51) * 1e-6.

163000 * 51 = 163000 * 50 is 8,150,000, plus 163000 *1 is 163,000. So total 8,313,000. Then times 1e-6 is 8.313.

So L ≈ 8.313 light-years.

Wait, that's a much shorter distance in the astronaut's frame. So the time for the trip is L divided by v. v is 0.99999987 c. So time Δt' is (8.313 ly) / (0.99999987 c) years.

Wait, because light-year is distance, and v is in terms of c. So 1 ly / (0.99999987 c) is approximately (1 / 0.99999987) years. Since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1.00000013. So 8.313 * 1.00000013 ≈ 8.313 years.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. Wait a second, no. Because in the astronaut's frame, the distance is 8.313 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c, so the time taken is (8.313 ly) / (0.99999987 c) = 8.313 / 0.99999987 years. Since 0.99999987 is almost 1, this is approximately 8.313 * 1.00000013 ≈ 8.313 + 0.0000083 ≈ 8.313 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 8.3 years on the trip. But wait, that's not matching the options. The options are in the 70s and 80s. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the distance. Let me double-check. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. So L0 is 163,000 ly. Then L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So yes, 163,000 * 5.1e-4 is about 83 years. Wait, no, 163,000 * 5.1e-4 is 81.33 years? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 163,000 * 0.00051 is 163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, plus 163,000 * 0.00001 is 1.63. So 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 light-years? No, that can't be. Wait, no, 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.000001. So 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63. So 81.5 + 0.000001 * 163,000 = 81.5 + 0.163 = 81.663.

Wait, I'm getting 81.663 light-years as the contracted distance.

Wait, then the time is L / v. So 81.663 ly divided by 0.99999987 c. Because 1 ly / c is 1 year, so 81.663 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.663 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81.663 + 0.000108 ≈ 81.663 years.

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old, so upon arrival, they would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old. Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years, so they would reach Earth before dying.

But wait, the options don't have 81.6. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.
B) 72 years
C) 81 years
D) 77 years

Wait, option C is 81 years, which is close to what I calculated.

But wait, I thought the trip time from the astronaut's perspective would be about 8 years, but that's not matching. Wait, no, I'm getting 81 years now. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the contracted distance.

Wait, wait, let's re-calculate L. L0 is 163,000 ly.

v is 0.99999987c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta is v/c.

So beta is 0.99999987.

So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - beta^2 is 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 163000 * 5.099e-4.

Let me compute 163000 * 5.099e-4.

5.099e-4 is 0.0005099.

163000 * 0.0005099 = ?

Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000099 = 1.6177.

So total is 81.5 + 1.6177 ≈ 83.1177 light-years.

Wait, so L is about 83.12 ly.

Then time is L / v.

v is 0.99999987c.

So time is (83.12 ly) / (0.99999987 c) = 83.12 / 0.99999987 years.

Since 0.99999987 ≈ 1, 83.12 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.12 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.12 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.12 years.

So the trip takes about 83 years from the astronaut's perspective. But the options don't have 83. Closest is option C) 81 years, which is a bit lower. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps my initial approximation for sqrt(1 - v^2) was a bit off.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2 = 0.9999997408 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0000002592.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.0000002592) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. 0.0000002592 is 2.592e-7.

What's the square root of 2.592e-7?

Well, sqrt(2.592) is about 1.6099. Because 1.6^2=2.56, 1.61^2=2.5921.

So sqrt(2.592e-7) is approximately 1.6099e-3.5? Wait, no, 2.592e-7 is 2.592 * 1e-7.

Wait, sqrt(2.592) is about 1.6099, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 which is 3.16e-4. Wait, no, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.16e-4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * sqrt(1e-7) ) = 1.6099 * 3.1623e-4.

So 1.6099 * 3.1623e-4 = approx 5.093e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 5.093e-4.

So L = 163000 * 5.093e-4.

Compute 163000 * 5.093e-4.

Which is 163000 * 0.0005093.

Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000093 = 1.5159.

Adding together: 81.5 + 1.5159 = 83.0159 ly.

So L is 83.0159 ly.

Time is 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.0159 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 83.0159 + 83.0159 * 1.3e-7.

83.0159 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 1.079e-5 years, which is about 3.91 hours, negligible.

So the time is approximately 83.016 years. Hmm, but the options don't have 83. The closest is option C:81 years. Did I make a mistake in the distance?

Wait, perhaps the distance is not 163,000 light-years. Let me think, the actual distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. So perhaps using 163,000 ly is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach, perhaps using the time experienced by the astronaut without considering the contracted distance.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut can be calculated using the time dilation formula, but using the Earth's frame time.

Wait, from Earth's frame, the time taken is 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

So from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 163,000 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the time is less due to time dilation. So Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So Δt' = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Which is 163,000 * sqrt(2.592e-7) ≈ 163,000 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 83.016 years.

Which is what I got earlier.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, or A (die before arrival).

But the astronaut is 22 years old. If the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so they would survive.

So the correct answer would be an experienced time of about 83 years. But the options don't have 83. The closest is C)81.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for the Lorentz factor.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the approximation for v ≈ c, where sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 - v^2/(2c^2).

Wait, let's compute it that way.

Using the approximation:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1 - (v^2)/(2 c^2) for v close to c.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2 ≈ (0.99999974) c^2.

So (v^2)/(2 c^2) = 0.99999974 / 2 ≈ 0.49999987.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, v is 0.99999987 c, so v^2 is (0.99999987)^2 c^2 = (approx) 0.99999974 c^2.

So (v^2)/(2 c^2) is 0.99999974 / 2 ≈ 0.49999987. So 1 - (v^2)/(2 c^2) = 1 - 0.49999987 = 0.50000013.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 0.50000013.

So L is 163000 ly * 0.50000013 ≈81,500.0219 ly.

Wait, so L is about 81,500 ly.

Then, time is 81,500 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81,500 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81,500.108 years.

Wait, that's 81,500 years, which can't be right because from the Earth's frame, the trip is only 163,000 years. But using the approximation, I'm getting a longer time.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the gamma factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1/(5.093e-4) ≈ 1962. So gamma is around 1962.

So from Earth's frame, the time is 163000 years. From the astronaut's frame, the time is Earth's time divided by gamma.

So Δt' = Δt / gamma = 163000 / 1962 ≈ 83 years.

Which brings us back to the same number as before, 83 years. But the options don't have that.

So in the options, the closest is C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 170,000 light-years. Let me recalculate with that.

But the problem says Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 160,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that at v = 0.99999987c, the Lorentz factor gamma is about 220.

Wait, let me compute gamma accurately.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

We have v = 0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

1 - v^2 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v^2) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961. So about 1961.

So time experienced is 163000 / 1961 ≈ 83 years.

Hmm. So why is 83 not an option? The options are 72, 77, 81, or die.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the contracted distance. Let me compute it again.

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163000 * 5.093e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005093.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

Compute 163000 * 0.0000093 = 1.5159.

Adding them gives 83.0159 ly.

So time is 83.0159 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.0159 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.0159 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.016 years.

So 83 years. But options don't have 83. Closest is 81, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without approximations.

Let me compute (1 - v^2/c^2) precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997408801 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997408801 = 0.0000002591199.

sqrt(0.0000002591199) = approximately 0.00050903.

So L = 163000 * 0.00050903 ≈ 163000 * 0.00050903.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00000903 = 163000 * 9.03e-6.

163000 * 9.03e-6 = 163000 * 0.00000903 ≈ 1.4739.

So L = 81.5 + 1.4739 ≈ 82.9739 ly.

Time is 82.9739 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.9739 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.9739 + 0.000108 ≈ 82.9748 years.

So approximately 83 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the time is calculated using the Earth's frame or the astronaut's frame. Let's think — the question asks how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. So the correct approach is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Proper time is given by tau = delta_t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no, proper time is calculated in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) occur at the same place. But in this case, the astronaut is moving, so the Earth is moving relative to them.

Alternatively, the time experienced by the astronaut can be found using the Lorentz transformation for time.

But perhaps a better way is to use the formula for proper time:

tau = delta_t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Where delta_t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, which is 163,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7 ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

Then tau = 163000.021 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163000.021 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 83 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years.

But again, the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years, which is the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for v.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that for v ≈ c, the time experienced is approximately distance / c.

Because when v is almost c, the time in the astronaut's frame is roughly L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) / v.

But wait, L0 is 163000 ly, v is 0.99999987c.

So L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = L0 * sqrt( (1 - v)(1 + v) ) ≈ L0 * (1 - v/2), assuming v is close to c.

Wait, perhaps this is a better approximation.

Let me think. When v is very close to c, 1 - v^2/c^2 = (1 - v)(1 + v) ≈ (1 - v) since (1 + v) ≈ 2.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ sqrt(2(1 - v)).

But when v is 0.99999987 c,

1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013.

So sqrt(2 * 0.00000013) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

Which is what I had before.

So perhaps the approximation isn't getting us anywhere. The calculation consistently gives about 83 years.

Since the options don't have 83, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time from Earth's perspective, but that can't be because the options are in the 70s and 80s, which would make the astronaut's age way beyond their average lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the time dilation using only the Lorentz factor without considering the contraction. Let me think, if the spaceship takes 163000 years from Earth's frame, then the astronaut's time would be 163000 / gamma, where gamma is 1961.

163000 / 1961 ≈ 83 years.

Which brings me back to the same conclusion.

But the options don't have 83. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption about the distance. The LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Maybe the problem uses a different figure, like 170,000 ly.

Let me recalculate with 170,000 ly.

L = 170,000 * 5.093e-4 ≈ 86.581 ly.

Time is 86.581 / 0.99999987 ≈ 86.58 years.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the correct answer is 83 years, but the closest option is C)81. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Lorentz factor.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of v is 0.99999987 c, so when I compute beta squared:

beta = 0.99999987.

beta squared is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997408801.

So 1 - beta squared is 0.0000002591199.

The square root of that is sqrt(2.591199e-7) ≈ 5.0903e-4.

So L = 163,000 * 5.0903e-4 = 163,000 * 0.00050903 ≈ 83.0159 ly.

So time is 83.0159 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.016 years.

Hmm.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 81 years, considering a more approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old. So if the trip takes about 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 +83 = 105 years old, which is less than 150, so they would survive.

But option A says they die before reaching. So option A is not correct.

Looking at the options, the only one close to my calculation is C) 81 years, but I'm getting 83. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation and expects the answer 72 years.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, let me compute 163000 * 0.00050903.

Let me compute 163000 * 0.00050903.

163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.00000903 = 163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467.

Plus 163000 * 0.00000003 = 0.00489.

So 1.467 + 0.00489 = 1.47189.

So total L = 81.5 + 1.47189 = 82.97189 ≈ 82.97 ly.

Time is 82.97 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.97 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.97 + (82.97 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 82.97 + 0.0000108 ≈ 82.97 years.

So approximately 83 years.

So the correct answer, based on the calculation, is about 83 years, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact distance and uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the time from the astronaut's perspective is calculated using the reciprocal of gamma multiplied by the time from Earth's perspective.

Wait, no, because time dilation says that the moving clock runs slower. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is running slow. But from the astronaut's frame, Earth's clock is running slow.

But the proper time is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the Earth's frame time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, for Earth's frame, time is 163000 years. So the astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(0.000000259) ≈163000 * 5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the velocity in the Lorentz factor differently. I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the approximation where for v ≈ c, the time experienced is L0 / (gamma * c).

Wait, L0 is 163000 ly.

gamma is 1962.

So L0 / (gamma c) = (163000 ly) / (1962 * c) = (163000 / 1962) * (ly / c) ) = (83.016) * 1 year = 83.016 years.

Same result.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81 years, considering the problem might have used a slightly different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the contraction and use the time from Earth's frame multiplied by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Earth's frame time is 163000 years. So the astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * 5.09e-4 = 83 years.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using v = 0.99999987c and considering the time as (distance) / (v), where distance is 163,000 ly, but that would give 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈163,000 years, which is way too long.

But no, because that's the time from Earth's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into using the time from Earth's frame and applying the Lorentz factor incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the time using the equation t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, because t is 163000, and t' is 83.

But again, the options don't have 83.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the twin paradox. In the twin paradox, the traveling twin ages less than the stay-at-home twin.

In this case, the Earth twin would age 163,000 years, while the astronaut ages 83 years.

So the astronaut would be 83 years old upon arrival, which is less than their average lifetime of 150, so they would survive.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81 years, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation where sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is approximated as 0.5.

In that case, L = 163000 * 0.5 =81500 ly.

Time would be 81500 / 0.99999987 ≈81500 *1.00000013≈81500 years. That can't be right.

Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the time from the astronaut's perspective to be (distance in their frame) / (v). Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the formula for time as Δt = (distance) / (v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, no, that would be (163000 ly / (0.99999987c)) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (163000 * 1.00000013) * 5.09e-4 ≈163000 *5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Same result.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, the closest is C)81 years. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use v= 0.99999987c and gamma as 220, leading to a time of 74 years, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Wait, no, light-years and years cancel correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. For example, if the distance is 77,000 light-years, the time would be 77,000 *0.5e-3=38.5 years, but that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time using only the time dilation formula and not the contraction, which would be wrong, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

Wait, that would be:

From Earth's frame, time is 163000 years.

Astronaut's time is 163000 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163000 *5.09e-4 ≈83 years.

Same as before.

Thus, I'm confident the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since it's not an option, I'm forced to choose the closest option, which is C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation and length contraction principles. The spaceship travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( L_0 = 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Length Contraction**:  
   In the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.093 \times 10^{-4}
   \]
   \[
   L = 163,000 \times 5.093 \times 10^{-4} \approx 83.016 \, \text{light-years}.
   \]

2. **Time Experienced by the Astronaut**:  
   The time experienced by the astronaut is the contracted distance divided by the spaceship's speed:
   \[
   \Delta t' = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{83.016 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}.
   \]
   Since \( 1 \, \text{light-year} / c = 1 \, \text{year} \), we approximate:
   \[
   \Delta t' \approx 83.016 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated time of approximately \( 83 \, \text{years} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 81 years**. This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately \( 83 \, \text{years} \) during the journey, but since this value is not listed, the best match is **C) 81 years**. Additionally, the astronaut's average lifetime of \( 150 \, \text{years} \) ensures they will survive the trip.

Answer: C
