Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I think I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe the "d" stands for something. Oh right, sometimes in organic compounds, the "d" could indicate that there's a deuterium or a double bond? Wait, no, I think in this context, 1-bromobenzene-2-d probably refers to a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Oh wait, no, another thought: maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the benzene has Br at position 1 and deuterium (which is like a H but heavier) at position 2.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think this is a typical dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might abstract a proton to form a double bond. But where?

Wait, let's think about the structure. If we have a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Wait, no, it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So benzene ring with Br at position 1, and a deuterium (so a hydrogen is replaced by deuterium) at position 2. So positions are like: Br at position 1, D at position 2, and the other positions are H.

So the molecule is o-bromo-dideutero benzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Wait, perhaps it's para, but no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so it's ortho.

Wait, but when we have a bromide on a benzene ring, and a base, what kind of reaction happens? For example, in E2 elimination, you need a good leaving group (Br-) and a proton that's anti to it. But benzene is a planar molecule, so maybe the deuterium is in a position that can be abstracted.

Wait, but wait. In aromatic substitution, when you have a bromide, perhaps the base could deprotonate a neighboring position, leading to a elimination to form a double bond. But benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So maybe this is about forming a diene or some sort of conjugated system.

Alternatively, I remember that when a benzene ring has a leaving group and a hydrogen adjacent, treatment with a strong base can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. For example, forming styrene from benzyl bromide. But in this case, the leaving group is on the ring.

Wait, maybe it's about forming a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the position where the Br was. So, if Br is at position 1, and the H or D is at position 2, then the base could abstract the proton at position 2, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, but the ring already has double bonds. Oh, wait, no, benzene is a ring with alternating single and double bonds, but it's a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps this is about forming a diradical or something else. Or maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where the Br was.

Wait, another thought: could this be a ring expansion or some kind of aromatic substitution? No, I think elimination is more likely. So the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted, leading to formation of a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated. So perhaps this is about forming a di-substituted benzene with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. The base (NaNH2) would abstract a proton that's beta to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in benzene, all the positions are equivalent in terms of conjugation. So, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. The H or D in position 2 is perhaps deprotonated by the base, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 2, which is adjacent to the Br at position 1, then the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between 1 and 2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the Br is gone. So the structure would be 1,2-dideutero benzene with a double bond between 1 and 2? Or perhaps the D is still present.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the structure is: benzene ring, position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, the others are H.

When the base abstracts the H from position 2, then the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between 1 and 2. So the product would be benzene with a double bond between 1 and 2, and deuterium at position 2? Wait, no because if the H at 2 is abstracted, it's a D, so when the base takes it, would the D be removed? Or perhaps the D is in a different position.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The starting molecule has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the positions are adjacent. So when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a good base, it will abstract a proton (or deuterium) that is adjacent to the Br, leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products. So perhaps the abstraction can occur in different positions, leading to different structures.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So the possible positions for the base to abstract would be position 2 (where D is) and perhaps position 6 (but in the starting material, position 6 is H). So wait, can the base abstract a proton from position 6 as well?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the others (3,4,5,6) are H. So the possible positions for deprotonation would be the Hs that are adjacent to the Br. So positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, which is a heavier isotope. So would the base abstract D or H? Hmm, because D is a bit more massive, but I'm not sure if that affects the reactivity. I think in such reactions, the base tends to abstract the more acidic proton, but in this case, position 2 is D, which is less acidic than regular H because it's a heavier isotope. Wait, no, isotopes don't usually affect acidity much. So perhaps the base can abstract either the D at position 2 or the H at position 6.

Wait, but wait. The base is NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a very strong base. So perhaps it can abstract any acidic protons. But in this molecule, positions 2 and 6 are the ones adjacent to Br. So if the base abstracts the H at position 6, then elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent, leading to a different product than if it abstracts the D at position 2.

Wait, but in the starting molecule, position 2 is D, so the base can abstract that D. But D is a heavier isotope, so it's a bit less reactive, but perhaps in practice, the base will abstract any available proton, including D. Alternatively, maybe the D is not abstracted because it's less acidic. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is more acidic than H? I don't think so. Usually, isotopic substitution doesn't change acidity much. So maybe the base can abstract either the D or the H.

Wait, but in the starting molecule, position 2 is D. So if the base abstracts the D, then the H at position 6 would be abstracted, leading to elimination at positions 1-2 (since D is at 2, but if abstracted, the adjacent position is 1). Wait, no. Wait, in the molecule, position 1 is Br, 2 is D, 3 is H, 4 is H, 5 is H, 6 is H.

So for elimination, the H (or D) that is abstracted must be adjacent to the Br. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Br at 1. So the base can abstract either the D at 2 or the H at 6.

If it abstracts the D at 2, then Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, but wait, benzene already has double bonds. Wait, no, when elimination occurs, the ring would lose a Br and form a double bond where it was single.

Wait, but benzene's structure is a ring of alternating single and double bonds. So if we eliminate Br from position 1 and form a double bond between 1 and 2, that would create an adjacent double bond, which might be conjugated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product becomes a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the possible products. If the base abstracts the D from position 2, elimination would occur between 1 and 2, forming a double bond. Similarly, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. But wait, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that's possible.

Wait, no, in benzene, positions are arranged in a ring. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. Positions 1 and 6 are also adjacent. So the elimination could happen either way, leading to a double bond between 1-2 or between 1-6. But wait, in benzene, that's the same thing because the ring is symmetric. Wait, no, because the substituents are different. Wait, no, because the starting molecule has Br at 1 and D at 2, but if the double bond is formed between 1 and 2, that's one structure, and between 1 and 6, another structure.

Wait, but if the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2, and the base abstracts the H at 6, then the double bond would form between 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is across from position 2. No, wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged in a hexagon. So position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So forming a double bond at 1-2 or 1-6 would both result in adjacent double bonds relative to the ring.

Wait, but in terms of the product structure, would these be different? Because the ring is symmetric. Let me visualize it. If I have a benzene ring with Br at position 1, and D at 2. If the base abstracts the H at position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D would be at position 2. But wait, that would mean the D is not part of the double bond.

Wait, no, elimination would involve the loss of Br and a H (or D) from adjacent positions, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two positions. So if the base abstracts the H from 6, then Br at 1 and H at 6 are eliminated, forming a double bond between 1 and 6. Similarly, if the base abstracts the D from 2, then Br at 1 and D at 2 are eliminated, forming a double bond between 1 and 2.

So that would give two different products. One where the double bond is between 1-2 and the D is gone, and another where the double bond is between 1-6, and the D is at position 2.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has the D at position 2. So when the base abstracts the D, that D is removed, right? Because deprotonation would take the proton (or deuterium) as the base. So if the base abstracts D from position 2, then that D is removed. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and no D at position 2.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D remains at position 2.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, meaning the D is at position 2. So when the base abstracts the D from position 2, the molecule loses HBr (since Br- is the leaving group and D is the abstracted proton). Wait, but D is not a proton. Hmmm, no, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and would abstract a proton, but in this case, position 2 has a D instead of H. So would the base abstract D or not?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's think about the acidity. D is a heavier isotope, but generally, deuterium is slightly less acidic than H because the bond strength is a bit higher. So in a solution where both H and D are present, the base would abstract the more acidic H first. But in this case, the starting material only has D at position 2, and H elsewhere.

Wait, wait no. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So all the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H, except position 2 which has D. So when the base (NaNH2) is introduced, it will abstract the most acidic available proton. The protons adjacent to the Br (positions 2 and 6) are more acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of Br. But position 2 is D, so the base can only abstract the H from position 6.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because in position 2, it's D, not H. So the only H available adjacent to Br is position 6.

So the base will abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1, then elimination of HBr occurs, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. So the product would have a double bond between positions 1 and 6, with the D remaining at position 2.

Alternatively, if the base could abstract the D from position 2, but since D is less acidic, maybe it doesn't. So in this case, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the base can abstract either the D or the H, but only if it's more acidic. If D is less acidic, then the H from position 6 is abstracted, leading to only one product. But what if the D is equally acidic? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the base is so strong that it abstracts any available proton, including D. But then, there are two possible positions (positions 2 and 6) from which the base could abstract a proton (or D), leading to two different products.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has D, not H. So the base can't abstract H from position 2 because it's D. So the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. Thus, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. The starting molecule has D at 2. So the H at position 6 is available, but what about other positions? Are there any other H's that are adjacent to Br? No, because position 1 is Br, adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, position 6 is H. So the base can only abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if only one product is formed, the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't occur at all, but I think NaNH2 is a strong enough base to cause elimination. So elimination is likely.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about benzene with a substituent. When a benzene ring has a leaving group like Br, and a strong base is present, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the leaving group. In this case, the Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6, and the D at position 2.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a proton from position 2 if the D is not there? No, because position 2 has D, not H. So the only abstractable proton is at position 6.

Wait, then why are the options including up to 4 products? Maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, which is not symmetrical. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, elimination occurs to form a double bond between 1 and 6. But wait, in the product, would that lead to any stereochemistry? No, because the benzene ring is symmetric. Or would the product have different structures based on where the double bond is formed?

Wait, no, because in the ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so the double bond would form between them, leading to a structure where the double bond is between 1 and 6. But I'm not sure how that affects the product count.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6, and the product would have the D at position 2. But since the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D at position 2. Alternatively, could the base abstract a proton from position 3, leading to a different elimination? No, because position 3 is not adjacent to the Br.

Wait, perhaps the reaction could lead to more than one product due to different possible positions for elimination, but in this case, there's only one possible H adjacent to Br (position 6), so only one product forms.

So the answer should be option B) 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the D could be abstracted, leading to another product. But if D is at position 2, and it's not a H, then the base can't abstract it. So the only possibility is elimination via position 6.

Therefore, the number of possible products is 1. So the answer is option B.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The reaction proceeds via an elimination mechanism where the strong base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond and the elimination of HBr (or DBr).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   - The benzene ring has:
     - Bromine at position 1.
     - Deuterium at position 2.
     - Hydrogens at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Mechanism of Elimination**:  
   - The base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton (or deuterium) that is adjacent to the bromine. In this case, the adjacent positions are:
     - Position 2 (which has deuterium, not hydrogen).
     - Position 6 (which has hydrogen).

3. **Feasibility of Abstraction**:  
   - Deuterium at position 2 is less acidic than hydrogen due to its higher isotope mass, making it less likely to be abstracted by the base.  
   - Therefore, the base preferentially abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

4. **Possible Products**:  
   - Since the base can only abstract the hydrogen at position 6 (as the deuterium at position 2 is not abstracted under these conditions), only one product is formed.  
   - The product is a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and the deuterium remaining at position 2.

### Conclusion:  
The reaction produces only one possible organic product due to the selective abstraction of the hydrogen at position 6 by the base NaNH₂.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I think I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe the "d" stands for something. Oh right, sometimes in organic compounds, the "d" could indicate that there's a deuterium or a double bond? Wait, no, I think in this context, 1-bromobenzene-2-d probably refers to a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Oh wait, no, another thought: maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the benzene has Br at position 1 and deuterium (which is like a H but heavier) at position 2.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think this is a typical dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might abstract a proton to form a double bond. But where?

Wait, let's think about the structure. If we have a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Wait, no, it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So benzene ring with Br at position 1, and a deuterium (so a hydrogen is replaced by deuterium) at position 2. So positions are like: Br at position 1, D at position 2, and the other positions are H.

So the molecule is o-bromo-dideutero benzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Wait, perhaps it's para, but no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so it's ortho.

Wait, but when we have a bromide on a benzene ring, and a base, what kind of reaction happens? For example, in E2 elimination, you need a good leaving group (Br-) and a proton that's anti to it. But benzene is a planar molecule, so maybe the deuterium is in a position that can be abstracted.

Wait, but wait. In aromatic substitution, when you have a bromide, perhaps the base could deprotonate a neighboring position, leading to a elimination to form a double bond. But benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So maybe this is about forming a diene or some sort of conjugated system.

Alternatively, I remember that when a benzene ring has a leaving group and a hydrogen adjacent, treatment with a strong base can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. For example, forming styrene from benzyl bromide. But in this case, the leaving group is on the ring.

Wait, maybe it's about forming a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the position where the Br was. So, if Br is at position 1, and the H or D is at position 2, then the base could abstract the proton at position 2, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, but the ring already has double bonds. Oh, wait, no, benzene is a ring with alternating single and double bonds, but it's a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps this is about forming a diradical or something else. Or maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where the Br was.

Wait, another thought: could this be a ring expansion or some kind of aromatic substitution? No, I think elimination is more likely. So the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted, leading to formation of a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated. So perhaps this is about forming a di-substituted benzene with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. The base (NaNH2) would abstract a proton that's beta to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in benzene, all the positions are equivalent in terms of conjugation. So, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. The H or D in position 2 is perhaps deprotonated by the base, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 2, which is adjacent to the Br at position 1, then the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between 1 and 2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the Br is gone. So the structure would be 1,2-dideutero benzene with a double bond between 1 and 2? Or perhaps the D is still present.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the structure is: benzene ring, position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, the others are H.

When the base abstracts the H from position 2, then the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between 1 and 2. So the product would be benzene with a double bond between 1 and 2, and deuterium at position 2? Wait, no because if the H at 2 is abstracted, it's a D, so when the base takes it, would the D be removed? Or perhaps the D is in a different position.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The starting molecule has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the positions are adjacent. So when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a good base, it will abstract a proton (or deuterium) that is adjacent to the Br, leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products. So perhaps the abstraction can occur in different positions, leading to different structures.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So the possible positions for the base to abstract would be position 2 (where D is) and perhaps position 6 (but in the starting material, position 6 is H). So wait, can the base abstract a proton from position 6 as well?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the others (3,4,5,6) are H. So the possible positions for deprotonation would be the Hs that are adjacent to the Br. So positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, which is a heavier isotope. So would the base abstract D or H? Hmm, because D is a bit more massive, but I'm not sure if that affects the reactivity. I think in such reactions, the base tends to abstract the more acidic proton, but in this case, position 2 is D, which is less acidic than regular H because it's a heavier isotope. Wait, no, isotopes don't usually affect acidity much. So perhaps the base can abstract either the D at position 2 or the H at position 6.

Wait, but wait. The base is NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a very strong base. So perhaps it can abstract any acidic protons. But in this molecule, positions 2 and 6 are the ones adjacent to Br. So if the base abstracts the H at position 6, then elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent, leading to a different product than if it abstracts the D at position 2.

Wait, but in the starting molecule, position 2 is D, so the base can abstract that D. But D is a heavier isotope, so it's a bit less reactive, but perhaps in practice, the base will abstract any available proton, including D. Alternatively, maybe the D is not abstracted because it's less acidic. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is more acidic than H? I don't think so. Usually, isotopic substitution doesn't change acidity much. So maybe the base can abstract either the D or the H.

Wait, but in the starting molecule, position 2 is D. So if the base abstracts the D, then the H at position 6 would be abstracted, leading to elimination at positions 1-2 (since D is at 2, but if abstracted, the adjacent position is 1). Wait, no. Wait, in the molecule, position 1 is Br, 2 is D, 3 is H, 4 is H, 5 is H, 6 is H.

So for elimination, the H (or D) that is abstracted must be adjacent to the Br. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Br at 1. So the base can abstract either the D at 2 or the H at 6.

If it abstracts the D at 2, then Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, but wait, benzene already has double bonds. Wait, no, when elimination occurs, the ring would lose a Br and form a double bond where it was single.

Wait, but benzene's structure is a ring of alternating single and double bonds. So if we eliminate Br from position 1 and form a double bond between 1 and 2, that would create an adjacent double bond, which might be conjugated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product becomes a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the possible products. If the base abstracts the D from position 2, elimination would occur between 1 and 2, forming a double bond. Similarly, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. But wait, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that's possible.

Wait, no, in benzene, positions are arranged in a ring. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. Positions 1 and 6 are also adjacent. So the elimination could happen either way, leading to a double bond between 1-2 or between 1-6. But wait, in benzene, that's the same thing because the ring is symmetric. Wait, no, because the substituents are different. Wait, no, because the starting molecule has Br at 1 and D at 2, but if the double bond is formed between 1 and 2, that's one structure, and between 1 and 6, another structure.

Wait, but if the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2, and the base abstracts the H at 6, then the double bond would form between 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is across from position 2. No, wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged in a hexagon. So position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So forming a double bond at 1-2 or 1-6 would both result in adjacent double bonds relative to the ring.

Wait, but in terms of the product structure, would these be different? Because the ring is symmetric. Let me visualize it. If I have a benzene ring with Br at position 1, and D at 2. If the base abstracts the H at position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D would be at position 2. But wait, that would mean the D is not part of the double bond.

Wait, no, elimination would involve the loss of Br and a H (or D) from adjacent positions, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two positions. So if the base abstracts the H from 6, then Br at 1 and H at 6 are eliminated, forming a double bond between 1 and 6. Similarly, if the base abstracts the D from 2, then Br at 1 and D at 2 are eliminated, forming a double bond between 1 and 2.

So that would give two different products. One where the double bond is between 1-2 and the D is gone, and another where the double bond is between 1-6, and the D is at position 2.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has the D at position 2. So when the base abstracts the D, that D is removed, right? Because deprotonation would take the proton (or deuterium) as the base. So if the base abstracts D from position 2, then that D is removed. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and no D at position 2.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D remains at position 2.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, meaning the D is at position 2. So when the base abstracts the D from position 2, the molecule loses HBr (since Br- is the leaving group and D is the abstracted proton). Wait, but D is not a proton. Hmmm, no, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and would abstract a proton, but in this case, position 2 has a D instead of H. So would the base abstract D or not?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's think about the acidity. D is a heavier isotope, but generally, deuterium is slightly less acidic than H because the bond strength is a bit higher. So in a solution where both H and D are present, the base would abstract the more acidic H first. But in this case, the starting material only has D at position 2, and H elsewhere.

Wait, wait no. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So all the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H, except position 2 which has D. So when the base (NaNH2) is introduced, it will abstract the most acidic available proton. The protons adjacent to the Br (positions 2 and 6) are more acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of Br. But position 2 is D, so the base can only abstract the H from position 6.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because in position 2, it's D, not H. So the only H available adjacent to Br is position 6.

So the base will abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1, then elimination of HBr occurs, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. So the product would have a double bond between positions 1 and 6, with the D remaining at position 2.

Alternatively, if the base could abstract the D from position 2, but since D is less acidic, maybe it doesn't. So in this case, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the base can abstract either the D or the H, but only if it's more acidic. If D is less acidic, then the H from position 6 is abstracted, leading to only one product. But what if the D is equally acidic? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the base is so strong that it abstracts any available proton, including D. But then, there are two possible positions (positions 2 and 6) from which the base could abstract a proton (or D), leading to two different products.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has D, not H. So the base can't abstract H from position 2 because it's D. So the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. Thus, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. The starting molecule has D at 2. So the H at position 6 is available, but what about other positions? Are there any other H's that are adjacent to Br? No, because position 1 is Br, adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, position 6 is H. So the base can only abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if only one product is formed, the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't occur at all, but I think NaNH2 is a strong enough base to cause elimination. So elimination is likely.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about benzene with a substituent. When a benzene ring has a leaving group like Br, and a strong base is present, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the leaving group. In this case, the Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6, and the D at position 2.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a proton from position 2 if the D is not there? No, because position 2 has D, not H. So the only abstractable proton is at position 6.

Wait, then why are the options including up to 4 products? Maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, which is not symmetrical. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, elimination occurs to form a double bond between 1 and 6. But wait, in the product, would that lead to any stereochemistry? No, because the benzene ring is symmetric. Or would the product have different structures based on where the double bond is formed?

Wait, no, because in the ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so the double bond would form between them, leading to a structure where the double bond is between 1 and 6. But I'm not sure how that affects the product count.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6, and the product would have the D at position 2. But since the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the D at position 2. Alternatively, could the base abstract a proton from position 3, leading to a different elimination? No, because position 3 is not adjacent to the Br.

Wait, perhaps the reaction could lead to more than one product due to different possible positions for elimination, but in this case, there's only one possible H adjacent to Br (position 6), so only one product forms.

So the answer should be option B) 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the D could be abstracted, leading to another product. But if D is at position 2, and it's not a H, then the base can't abstract it. So the only possibility is elimination via position 6.

Therefore, the number of possible products is 1. So the answer is option B.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The reaction proceeds via an elimination mechanism where the strong base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond and the elimination of HBr (or DBr).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   - The benzene ring has:
     - Bromine at position 1.
     - Deuterium at position 2.
     - Hydrogens at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Mechanism of Elimination**:  
   - The base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton (or deuterium) that is adjacent to the bromine. In this case, the adjacent positions are:
     - Position 2 (which has deuterium, not hydrogen).
     - Position 6 (which has hydrogen).

3. **Feasibility of Abstraction**:  
   - Deuterium at position 2 is less acidic than hydrogen due to its higher isotope mass, making it less likely to be abstracted by the base.  
   - Therefore, the base preferentially abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

4. **Possible Products**:  
   - Since the base can only abstract the hydrogen at position 6 (as the deuterium at position 2 is not abstracted under these conditions), only one product is formed.  
   - The product is a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and the deuterium remaining at position 2.

### Conclusion:  
The reaction produces only one possible organic product due to the selective abstraction of the hydrogen at position 6 by the base NaNH₂.
