Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity ratio, which the astronomers calculated to be a certain factor. We need to find out by how much Star_1 is more luminous than Star_2.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably the black body radiation because the question says they radiate as black bodies. Remember, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So lambda for Star_1 equals lambda for Star_2. Since lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, that means their temperatures must be the same if their peak wavelengths are the same. Because if lambda is same, T is same since T is inversely proportional to lambda_max.

Wait, but wait. Because I'm assuming that the peak emission is the same for both. So lambda_max is same, so T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but what about their luminosities? Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both have the same T, then L is proportional to R². So, for Star_1 and Star_2, L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)². Because T is same.

Wait, but Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times larger. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, the options don't all have 2.23 or similar, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the problem?

Ah, wait. If the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda peaks are same. But the actual emitted lambda_max depends on their rest frame temperatures.

So if Star_2 has a radial velocity, that affects the observed wavelength. So the observed lambda is lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) or something like that, but wait, the Doppler shift formula depends on whether it's approaching or receding. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, perhaps that's a redshift or blueshift.

Wait, but in the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So, let's denote: lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

But lambda_1_obs is the observed wavelength of Star_1, which is in its rest frame because its radial velocity is zero. So lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.

Similarly, Star_2 is moving with velocity v. So the observed lambda_2_obs is lambda_2_rest multiplied by sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive when moving away (redshift). Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). If it's moving towards, it's shorter.

But in the problem, both observed lambdas are the same. So lambda_1_rest equals lambda_2_obs.

So, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T.

So, let me write:

lambda_1_rest = b / T1

lambda_2_rest = b / T2

But since lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * Doppler factor.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, but wait. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda is longer than its rest frame. So if Star_2 is moving away, then lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v/c)/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) )? Or perhaps I should think about the relativistic Doppler shift formula correctly.

Wait, the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But v is positive when the source is moving away (redshift). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem doesn't specify if it's moving towards or away. Wait, the radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the radial velocity is defined as the component of the velocity along the line of sight. Positive velocity indicates moving away (redshift), negative is moving towards (blueshift). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning it is moving away.

So, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest, because Star_1 is not moving.

And the problem states that lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

So,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_1_rest = b / T1,

lambda_2_rest = b / T2,

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

=> T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So T1 and T2 are not the same. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect because of the Doppler shift. That changes everything.

So now, we have T1 and T2 related by that equation. So let's compute T1 in terms of T2.

But we have v = 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c.

Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v =700 / 3e5 = approximately 0.002333... So v/c ≈ 0.00233.

So let's compute (1 - v/c) and (1 + v/c):

1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333

1 - v/c ≈ 0.9976667

So the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is approximately (0.9976667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99533.

So sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

Wait, that means T1 is about 0.99766 * T2. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, earlier I thought the temperatures were same, but due to Doppler effect, that's not the case. So the stars have different temperatures.

But then, how does that affect the luminosity?

Because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth.

So L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ T2 * 0.99766.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 0.99766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4.

Let's compute that. 0.99766^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00234) = 1 - 0.00468 = 0.99532.

Then, (0.99532)^2 ≈ 0.99064.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99064.

So putting it all together,

L1/L2 ≈ (2.25) * (0.99064) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99064 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, so approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier when I ignored the Doppler effect, I thought the answer was 2.25, which is option A. But considering the Doppler shift, the luminosity ratio is a bit less than that, about 2.23, so option D.

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations more precisely. Maybe my approximations were too rough.

Let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) exactly.

v =700 km/s,

c=299792 km/s,

v/c =700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002337.

So 1 - v/c = 0.997663,

1 + v/c =1.002337.

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.997663)/(1.002337).

Let me compute that: 0.997663 / 1.002337.

Approximately, 0.997663 / 1.002337 ≈ 0.995325.

Now sqrt(0.995325) is approximately 0.99766 (since 0.99766^2 ≈ 0.99533).

So T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

Then T1/T2 = 0.99766.

Then (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99766)^4.

Compute 0.99766^2: 0.99766 * 0.99766.

Let me compute 0.99766 * 0.99766:

= (1 - 0.00234) * (1 - 0.00234)

= 1 - 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 0.9953254756.

So square again: (0.9953254756)^2 = ?

Compute as (1 - 0.004674524)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004674524) + (0.004674524)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009349048 + 0.000021857 ≈ approx 0.9906718.

So (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.99067.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.99067) = 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067.

Let's compute 2.25 * 0.99067.

2 * 0.99067 = 1.98134.

0.25 * 0.99067 = 0.2476675.

Adding together: 1.98134 + 0.2476675 ≈ 2.2290075.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be D) ~2.23.

To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data. The stars radiate as black bodies, and their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Using Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature: 

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}.
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the stars' temperatures must satisfy:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}},
\]

where \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) is the radial velocity of Star_2, and \(c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s}\) is the speed of light. Calculating \(v/c\):

\[
v/c \approx \frac{700}{299,792} \approx 0.002337.
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002337}{1 + 0.002337}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997663}{1.002337}} \approx \sqrt{0.995325} \approx 0.99766.
\]

Thus, \(T_1 \approx 0.99766 \, T_2\).

Next, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
\]

so the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\), we have:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]

Substituting \(T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99766\):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99766)^4.
\]

First, calculate \((0.99766)^2\):

\[
(0.99766)^2 \approx 1 - 2(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 \approx 0.99532.
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.99532)^2 \approx 1 - 2(0.00468) + (0.00468)^2 \approx 0.99067.
\]

Thus, \((T_1 / T_2)^4 \approx 0.99067\). Combining all terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99067 \approx 2.229.
\]

This value is approximately \(2.23\), which corresponds to option D.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.

Since lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, that means their temperatures must be the same if their peak wavelengths are the same. Because if lambda is same, T is same since T is inversely proportional to lambda_max.

Wait, but wait. Because I'm assuming that the peak emission is the same for both. So lambda_max is same, so T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but what about their luminosities? Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both have the same T, then L is proportional to R². So, for Star_1 and Star_2, L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)². Because T is same.

Wait, but Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times larger. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, the options don't all have 2.23 or similar, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the problem?

Ah, wait. If the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda peaks are same. But the actual emitted lambda_max depends on their rest frame temperatures.

So if Star_2 has a radial velocity, that affects the observed wavelength. So the observed lambda is lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) or something like that, but wait, the Doppler shift formula depends on whether it's approaching or receding. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, perhaps that's a redshift or blueshift.

Wait, but in the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So, let's denote: lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

But lambda_1_obs is the observed wavelength of Star_1, which is in its rest frame because its radial velocity is zero. So lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.

Similarly, Star_2 is moving with velocity v. So the observed lambda_2_obs is lambda_2_rest multiplied by sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive when moving away (redshift). Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). If it's moving towards, it's shorter.

But in the problem, both observed lambdas are the same. So lambda_1_rest equals lambda_2_obs.

So, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T.

So, let me write:

lambda_1_rest = b / T1

lambda_2_rest = b / T2

But since lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * Doppler factor.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, but wait. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda is longer than its rest frame. So if Star_2 is moving away, then lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v/c)/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) )? Or perhaps I should think about the relativistic Doppler shift formula correctly.

Wait, the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But v is positive when the source is moving away (redshift). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem doesn't specify if it's moving towards or away. Wait, the radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the radial velocity is defined as the component of the velocity along the line of sight. Positive velocity indicates moving away (redshift), negative is moving towards (blueshift). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning it is moving away.

So, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest, because Star_1 is not moving.

And the problem states that lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

So,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_1_rest = b / T1,

lambda_2_rest = b / T2,

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

=> T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So T1 and T2 are not the same. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect because of the Doppler shift. That changes everything.

So now, we have T1 and T2 related by that equation. So let's compute T1 in terms of T2.

But we have v = 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c.

Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v =700 / 3e5 = approximately 0.002333... So v/c ≈ 0.00233.

So let's compute (1 - v/c) and (1 + v/c):

1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333

1 - v/c ≈ 0.9976667

So the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is approximately (0.9976667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99533.

So sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

Wait, that means T1 is about 0.99766 * T2. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, earlier I thought the temperatures were same, but due to Doppler effect, that's not the case. So the stars have different temperatures.

But then, how does that affect the luminosity?

Because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth.

So L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ T2 * 0.99766.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 0.99766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4.

Let's compute that. 0.99766^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00234) = 1 - 0.00468 = 0.99532.

Then, (0.99532)^2 ≈ 0.99064.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99064.

So putting it all together,

L1/L2 ≈ (2.25) * (0.99064) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99064 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, so approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier when I ignored the Doppler effect, I thought the answer was 2.25, which is option A. But considering the Doppler shift, the luminosity ratio is a bit less than that, about 2.23, so option D.

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations more precisely. Maybe my approximations were too rough.

Let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) exactly.

v =700 km/s,

c=299792 km/s,

v/c =700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002337.

So 1 - v/c = 0.997663,

1 + v/c =1.002337.

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.997663)/(1.002337).

Let me compute that: 0.997663 / 1.002337.

Approximately, 0.997663 / 1.002337 ≈ 0.995325.

Now sqrt(0.995325) is approximately 0.99766 (since 0.99766^2 ≈ 0.99533).

So T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

Then T1/T2 = 0.99766.

Then (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99766)^4.

Compute 0.99766^2: 0.99766 * 0.99766.

Let me compute 0.99766 * 0.99766:

= (1 - 0.00234) * (1 - 0.00234)

= 1 - 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 0.9953254756.

So square again: (0.9953254756)^2 = ?

Compute as (1 - 0.004674524)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004674524) + (0.004674524)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009349048 + 0.000021857 ≈ approx 0.9906718.

So (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.99067.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.99067) = 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067.

Let's compute 2.25 * 0.99067.

2 * 0.99067 = 1.98134.

0.25 * 0.99067 = 0.2476675.

Adding together: 1.98134 + 0.2476675 ≈ 2.2290075.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be D) ~2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data. The stars radiate as black bodies, and their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Using Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature: 

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}.
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the stars' temperatures must satisfy:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}},
\]

where \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) is the radial velocity of Star_2, and \(c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s}\) is the speed of light. Calculating \(v/c\):

\[
v/c \approx \frac{700}{299,792} \approx 0.002337.
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002337}{1 + 0.002337}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997663}{1.002337}} \approx \sqrt{0.995325} \approx 0.99766.
\]

Thus, \(T_1 \approx 0.99766 \, T_2\).

Next, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
\]

so the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\), we have:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]

Substituting \(T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99766\):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99766)^4.
\]

First, calculate \((0.99766)^2\):

\[
(0.99766)^2 \approx 1 - 2(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 \approx 0.99532.
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.99532)^2 \approx 1 - 2(0.00468) + (0.00468)^2 \approx 0.99067.
\]

Thus, \((T_1 / T_2)^4 \approx 0.99067\). Combining all terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99067 \approx 2.229.
\]

This value is approximately \(2.23\), which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
