Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator follows Hooke's law, where F = -kx. The potential energy is (1/2)kx² and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I can't use the classical equations directly.

In a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for the classical case, at the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum. So, the total energy E would be (1/2)kA², right? Because the potential is maximum at x=A, so E = (1/2)kA². Then, at x=0, all that energy is kinetic, so E = (1/2)mv_max². Solving, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Wait, that's option C. But wait, options A, B, D involve c and look more relativistic.

But wait, the question is relativistic, so maybe I need to consider relativistic effects. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy is gamma times mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc².

So maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum. Let me think. The total energy in relativity is E = gamma m c². The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about that. Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential would be similar to the classical case, but perhaps modified due to relativistic considerations. Or maybe not, because F could be relativistic force.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the virial theorem or something else. Wait, maybe I should set up the equations of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be different from the classical one. The classical equation is F = -kx = m d²x/dt². But relativistically, the mass becomes gamma m, but also, maybe the expression for F is different.

Wait, another approach: in the relativistic case, the potential energy might still be (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2 mv²). Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

So the total energy E would be the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. At maximum amplitude A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So, let's model this.

At x=A, the speed is zero. So, kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A². At x=0, potential is zero, kinetic is maximum. So,

E_total = KE_max + PE_min? Wait, no, because in reality, maybe the potential isn't the same in the relativistic case, but the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, which would imply the potential is (1/2)k x², same as classical. Hmm, but in relativistic mechanics, the mass increases, so maybe the equations are more complicated.

Wait, let me think of the relativistic energy. The total energy is gamma m c². The potential energy is (1/2)k x². So, at maximum amplitude x = A, the speed is zero, so gamma is just m c². So E_total = (m c²) + (1/2)k A². Because at x=A, the kinetic is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A².

Wait, no. Wait, gamma is (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), and when v is zero, gamma is 1. So, E_total is gamma m c² + (1/2)k x². But wait, in the problem, the oscillator is 1D and relativistic, so perhaps the potential is different? Or maybe the potential is still (1/2)k x², and the kinetic is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, perhaps I should equate the energies at x=0 and x=A.

At x=A, kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². Wait, but that's only true for the classical case. Relativistically, the total energy is gamma m c^2 plus the potential energy. At x=A, v=0, so gamma is 1. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, the potential is zero, and kinetic is maximum. So E = gamma_max m c^2. Therefore,

gamma_max m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2) k A².

So, gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²) ) ?

Wait, let's compute:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

Wait, but I have to solve for v_max, which is the speed when x=0. So,

gamma_max = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)).

So,

sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / gamma_max.

So,

1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = 1/(gamma_max)^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma_max)^2.

Now, substituting gamma_max,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma_max^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2.

Thus,

1/(gamma_max^2) = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Substituting back,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute 1 - (a²)/(b²) = (b² - a²)/b².

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Expanding numerator:

= [ ( (2 m c²)^2 + 2 * 2 m c² * k A² + (k A²)^2 ) - (2 m c² )^2 ] / denominator.

Simplify:

= [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 -4 m² c^4 ] / denominator.

= [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / denominator.

Factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) / denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me see.

Wait, the numerator is k A² (2 m c² + k A² ) * 2, because 4 m c^2 is 2*(2 m c^2). Hmm, not sure. Let me check:

Wait, 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 = (k A^2 + 2 m c² )^2.

Hmm, so numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe 4 m c² + k A² is 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as k A² (2*(2 m c^2) ) + ... I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to look for the expression of v_max in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier, I thought that E_total at x=A is gamma * mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, no, actually, the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the potential energy is separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at x=A.

So,

E = m c² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, E = gamma m c².

So,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), which gives:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]².

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute this.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as some variable, say, alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1+alpha)^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = [ (1+alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1+alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha² )/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small term if m c^2 is much larger than k A². But perhaps it's not necessarily small here.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha).

Substituting alpha,

= c * sqrt( [2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + (k A²/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify numerator inside sqrt:

= [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

So,

sqrt [ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2) )) ]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is (2 alpha + alpha²) = alpha (2 + alpha). And denominator is (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

Wait, maybe I can write 2 + alpha as (1 + alpha) + 1.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: let me write alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

2 alpha = (k A²)/(m c²).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) + (k A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ] divided by (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the options provided.

The options are:

A) v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

B) v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

C) v = sqrt( k A²/m )

D) v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, in my expression, v²/c² = [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me compute this expression.

Numerator: 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha )

Denominator: (1 + alpha )^2.

So,

v²/c² = alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

(2 + alpha) = (1 + alpha) + 1.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can split the fraction:

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha )^2 + alpha / (1 + alpha )^2.

= alpha/(1 + alpha ) + alpha/(1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach is to write the expression as:

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha )^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 )

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha) (1 + alpha) )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me plug in alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) into this expression.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: alpha (2 + alpha ) = (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ] 

= (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Denominator: (1 + alpha )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 

= ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

Simplify fractions:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, now I can write 4 m c^2 + k A^2 as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

But this doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2. Numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ].

Wait, maybe I can write:

Numerator = k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 )

= k A^2 ( something + 2 m c^2 )

But perhaps I can factor this as k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) (1) + 2 m c^2 (1) )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A^2 ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

So,

Numerator = k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (2 m c² + kA² ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (2 m c² + kA² )^2.

= [ k A² (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 2 m c^2 + (2 m c^2 ) is 4 m c^2. So, 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 is 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

Wait, but that would mean numerator is k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ), but that's what we had before. Hmm, not helpful.

Maybe I should consider that none of the options are looking like this, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic case isn't (1/2) k x^2. Because in relativity, when you have a force F, the potential is integral of F dx, but with F possibly being relativistic. Alternatively, maybe the potential is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of momentum. Let me consider the force F = -k x, which in relativity would relate to acceleration as F = gamma m a, where a is the proper acceleration, but wait, that's getting complicated.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the given options again. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option C is the classical result, which is sqrt(k A²/m), which is v_max = A sqrt(k/m). So, in the non-relativistic case, that's correct, but since the question is relativistic, option C is probably not the right answer.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that's not dimensionally correct, because inside the sqrt, the terms must be dimensionless. Let me see: (k A²)/(2 m c^2) is dimensionless because k has units N/m, so k A² is kg s^{-2}, and m c^2 is kg m^2/s^2. So, kg s^{-2} / (kg m^2/s^2) ) = 1/(m^2) * s^2 / s^2 * m^2? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me compute the units.

F = ma, so k has units N/m = kg/s².

So, (k A² ) has units (kg/s² ) * m^2 = kg m²/s².

m c² has units kg (m²/s²).

So, (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) has units (kg m²/s² )/( kg m²/s^2 ) ) = dimensionless. So, option B's denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is dimensionless.

So, 1 + 1/(1 - ( ... )) would be 1 + [1/(dimensionless)] which is 1 + dimensionless. So, the argument inside the sqrt is okay.

But how does that fit with our earlier expression? Hmm.

Wait, our expression for v_max^2/c^2 is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm. Let me write this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= c^2 * [ (k A^2 ) (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Let me take denominator (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = (let's call it term X )^2.

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ].

So, numerator can be written as 2 k A^2 (2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (k A^2 ) ( (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 ). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as (k A^2 ) [ (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 ] = (k A^2 ) [ 4 m c^2 + (k A^2 ) ].

Hmm, perhaps this doesn't help. Maybe I should compare this expression with the options.

Looking at option D: v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which would be,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 – 1 ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ) – 1 =

= 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

= (k A²)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

Comparing to our earlier expression for v²/c², which was [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator of option D's expression.

The numerator for option D's v²/c² is (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

Wait, but our expression is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So, isn't the numerator of option D's v²/c² equal to [ (k A^2 )/(4 m c^2 ) ) ] times the numerator of our expression? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the numerator and denominator.

Wait,

Our expression's numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Option D's numerator: (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) = [4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Wait, no. Let me compute:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) = (k A^2 ) * (1/(m c²)).

(k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) = (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

So,

Numerator for D's v²/c² is [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

= [4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Hmm, comparing to our expression:

Our numerator is 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So,

Our numerator = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

D's numerator = k A^2 (4 c^2 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) ) /4 m^2 c^4 ?

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should plug in numbers to see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of small k A^2/(m c^2 ) case. Suppose k A² is much smaller than 2 m c^2, then:

In our expression, gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ). So, gamma_max is approximately 1 + some small term.

So, v_max^2/c^2 ≈ [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

With alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ~ small, so (1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 1 + 2 alpha.

2 alpha + alpha^2 ≈ 2 alpha.

So,

v²/c² ≈ (2 alpha )/(1 + 2 alpha ) ≈ 2 alpha (1 - 2 alpha ) ) = 2 alpha - 4 alpha².

But since alpha is small, v^2/c^2 ≈ 2 alpha = (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ).

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 /m ) ) = sqrt( k/m ) A.

Which is the classical result, as expected in the non-relativistic limit. So, the expression should reduce to the classical result when k A^2 is much less than m c^2. Looking at the options:

Option C is sqrt(k A²/m ), which is the classical result. So, in the limit where relativistic effects are small, option C is correct. But the question is about the relativistic case, so option C isn't the right answer.

Looking at the options again, let's check each one when k A^2 is small.

Option B: v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - x) ), where x is small. 1/(1-x) is approximately 1 + x. So sqrt( 2 + x ), which would be more than the classical result, which doesn't make sense in the limit.

Option D: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), where x is small. So, 1/(1+x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x. So,

1 - [1 -2x ] = 2x.

So, v^2/c^2 ≈ 2x = (k A^2)/(m c^2 ), so v ≈ sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2) ) c = sqrt( k A^2/m ), same as classical. So, option D matches the classical limit.

Similarly, option A: when x is small, 1/(1 - x )^2 ≈ 1 + 2x. So,

sqrt( 1 + 1/(1-x)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 1 + 1 + 2x ) = sqrt( 2 + 2x ), which would be larger than the classical speed. So, not matching the non-relativistic limit.

Option B: as before, it doesn't match.

So, option D matches the non-relativistic limit. So, perhaps option D is the correct answer.

Wait, let me compare our expression to option D.

Our expression for v²/c² is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Option D's expression is v_max²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ].

Which simplifies to:

[ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which becomes:

[ 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) - 1 ] / denominator.

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] / denominator.

Hmm. Let me compare this to our expression.

Our expression is:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

= [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 )

Option D's expression is:

[ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] 

= [ 4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So, denominator is 4 m² c^4.

Comparing to our expression:

Our numerator is 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

But option D's numerator is 4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4.

Only the first term differs by a factor of m.

Hmm, not the same. So perhaps option D is not the correct one.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the correct approach again.

Wait, another approach: in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is (d/dt)(gamma m v ) = -k x.

But x and v are related by v = dx/dt. So, this gives a differential equation. However, solving this would be complicated, and perhaps it's beyond my current capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the virial theorem. The virial theorem states that for a potential V(x) = (1/2) k x^2, the average kinetic energy is equal to the average potential energy. So, <KE> = <PE>.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma -1 ) m c^2. So, perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, and the potential is zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

Hmm. Maybe I should express the total energy as a sum of rest mass energy and potential energy, then set that equal to the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy when x=0.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. Because E_total is m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2, and at x=0, E_total = gamma m c^2.

So, gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before.

So, from gamma, we get v_max.

So, solving for v_max, we have:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = [1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/[1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Which is,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

= [ (1 + 2*(k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )) - 1 ] / denominator.

= [ (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / denominator.

Hmm, and the denominator is [1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Wait, but this expression seems to match option D.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which, when squared,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which is exactly the expression I derived.

So, yes, option D is the correct one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \): 

\[
E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The total energy at this point is given by the relativistic energy expression:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we find:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression does not match the derived formula and introduces an incorrect denominator.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. This matches the derived formula exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator follows Hooke's law, where F = -kx. The potential energy is (1/2)kx² and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I can't use the classical equations directly.

In a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for the classical case, at the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum. So, the total energy E would be (1/2)kA², right? Because the potential is maximum at x=A, so E = (1/2)kA². Then, at x=0, all that energy is kinetic, so E = (1/2)mv_max². Solving, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Wait, that's option C. But wait, options A, B, D involve c and look more relativistic.

But wait, the question is relativistic, so maybe I need to consider relativistic effects. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy is gamma times mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc².

So maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum. Let me think. The total energy in relativity is E = gamma m c². The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about that. Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential would be similar to the classical case, but perhaps modified due to relativistic considerations. Or maybe not, because F could be relativistic force.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the virial theorem or something else. Wait, maybe I should set up the equations of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be different from the classical one. The classical equation is F = -kx = m d²x/dt². But relativistically, the mass becomes gamma m, but also, maybe the expression for F is different.

Wait, another approach: in the relativistic case, the potential energy might still be (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2 mv²). Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

So the total energy E would be the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. At maximum amplitude A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So, let's model this.

At x=A, the speed is zero. So, kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A². At x=0, potential is zero, kinetic is maximum. So,

E_total = KE_max + PE_min? Wait, no, because in reality, maybe the potential isn't the same in the relativistic case, but the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, which would imply the potential is (1/2)k x², same as classical. Hmm, but in relativistic mechanics, the mass increases, so maybe the equations are more complicated.

Wait, let me think of the relativistic energy. The total energy is gamma m c². The potential energy is (1/2)k x². So, at maximum amplitude x = A, the speed is zero, so gamma is just m c². So E_total = (m c²) + (1/2)k A². Because at x=A, the kinetic is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A².

Wait, no. Wait, gamma is (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), and when v is zero, gamma is 1. So, E_total is gamma m c² + (1/2)k x². But wait, in the problem, the oscillator is 1D and relativistic, so perhaps the potential is different? Or maybe the potential is still (1/2)k x², and the kinetic is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, perhaps I should equate the energies at x=0 and x=A.

At x=A, kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². Wait, but that's only true for the classical case. Relativistically, the total energy is gamma m c^2 plus the potential energy. At x=A, v=0, so gamma is 1. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, the potential is zero, and kinetic is maximum. So E = gamma_max m c^2. Therefore,

gamma_max m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2) k A².

So, gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²) ) ?

Wait, let's compute:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

Wait, but I have to solve for v_max, which is the speed when x=0. So,

gamma_max = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)).

So,

sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / gamma_max.

So,

1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = 1/(gamma_max)^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma_max)^2.

Now, substituting gamma_max,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma_max^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2.

Thus,

1/(gamma_max^2) = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Substituting back,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute 1 - (a²)/(b²) = (b² - a²)/b².

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Expanding numerator:

= [ ( (2 m c²)^2 + 2 * 2 m c² * k A² + (k A²)^2 ) - (2 m c² )^2 ] / denominator.

Simplify:

= [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 -4 m² c^4 ] / denominator.

= [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / denominator.

Factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) / denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me see.

Wait, the numerator is k A² (2 m c² + k A² ) * 2, because 4 m c^2 is 2*(2 m c^2). Hmm, not sure. Let me check:

Wait, 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 = (k A^2 + 2 m c² )^2.

Hmm, so numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe 4 m c² + k A² is 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as k A² (2*(2 m c^2) ) + ... I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to look for the expression of v_max in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier, I thought that E_total at x=A is gamma * mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, no, actually, the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the potential energy is separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at x=A.

So,

E = m c² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, E = gamma m c².

So,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), which gives:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]².

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute this.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as some variable, say, alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1+alpha)^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = [ (1+alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1+alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha² )/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small term if m c^2 is much larger than k A². But perhaps it's not necessarily small here.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha).

Substituting alpha,

= c * sqrt( [2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + (k A²/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify numerator inside sqrt:

= [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

So,

sqrt [ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2) )) ]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is (2 alpha + alpha²) = alpha (2 + alpha). And denominator is (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

Wait, maybe I can write 2 + alpha as (1 + alpha) + 1.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: let me write alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

2 alpha = (k A²)/(m c²).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) + (k A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ] divided by (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the options provided.

The options are:

A) v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

B) v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

C) v = sqrt( k A²/m )

D) v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, in my expression, v²/c² = [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me compute this expression.

Numerator: 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha )

Denominator: (1 + alpha )^2.

So,

v²/c² = alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

(2 + alpha) = (1 + alpha) + 1.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can split the fraction:

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha )^2 + alpha / (1 + alpha )^2.

= alpha/(1 + alpha ) + alpha/(1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach is to write the expression as:

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha )^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 )

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha) (1 + alpha) )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me plug in alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) into this expression.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: alpha (2 + alpha ) = (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ] 

= (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Denominator: (1 + alpha )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 

= ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

Simplify fractions:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, now I can write 4 m c^2 + k A^2 as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

But this doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2. Numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ].

Wait, maybe I can write:

Numerator = k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 )

= k A^2 ( something + 2 m c^2 )

But perhaps I can factor this as k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) (1) + 2 m c^2 (1) )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A^2 ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

So,

Numerator = k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (2 m c² + kA² ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (2 m c² + kA² )^2.

= [ k A² (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 2 m c^2 + (2 m c^2 ) is 4 m c^2. So, 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 is 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

Wait, but that would mean numerator is k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ), but that's what we had before. Hmm, not helpful.

Maybe I should consider that none of the options are looking like this, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic case isn't (1/2) k x^2. Because in relativity, when you have a force F, the potential is integral of F dx, but with F possibly being relativistic. Alternatively, maybe the potential is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of momentum. Let me consider the force F = -k x, which in relativity would relate to acceleration as F = gamma m a, where a is the proper acceleration, but wait, that's getting complicated.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the given options again. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option C is the classical result, which is sqrt(k A²/m), which is v_max = A sqrt(k/m). So, in the non-relativistic case, that's correct, but since the question is relativistic, option C is probably not the right answer.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that's not dimensionally correct, because inside the sqrt, the terms must be dimensionless. Let me see: (k A²)/(2 m c^2) is dimensionless because k has units N/m, so k A² is kg s^{-2}, and m c^2 is kg m^2/s^2. So, kg s^{-2} / (kg m^2/s^2) ) = 1/(m^2) * s^2 / s^2 * m^2? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me compute the units.

F = ma, so k has units N/m = kg/s².

So, (k A² ) has units (kg/s² ) * m^2 = kg m²/s².

m c² has units kg (m²/s²).

So, (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) has units (kg m²/s² )/( kg m²/s^2 ) ) = dimensionless. So, option B's denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is dimensionless.

So, 1 + 1/(1 - ( ... )) would be 1 + [1/(dimensionless)] which is 1 + dimensionless. So, the argument inside the sqrt is okay.

But how does that fit with our earlier expression? Hmm.

Wait, our expression for v_max^2/c^2 is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm. Let me write this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= c^2 * [ (k A^2 ) (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Let me take denominator (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = (let's call it term X )^2.

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ].

So, numerator can be written as 2 k A^2 (2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (k A^2 ) ( (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 ). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as (k A^2 ) [ (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 ] = (k A^2 ) [ 4 m c^2 + (k A^2 ) ].

Hmm, perhaps this doesn't help. Maybe I should compare this expression with the options.

Looking at option D: v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which would be,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 – 1 ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ) – 1 =

= 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

= (k A²)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

Comparing to our earlier expression for v²/c², which was [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator of option D's expression.

The numerator for option D's v²/c² is (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

Wait, but our expression is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So, isn't the numerator of option D's v²/c² equal to [ (k A^2 )/(4 m c^2 ) ) ] times the numerator of our expression? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the numerator and denominator.

Wait,

Our expression's numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Option D's numerator: (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) = [4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Wait, no. Let me compute:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) = (k A^2 ) * (1/(m c²)).

(k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) = (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ).

So,

Numerator for D's v²/c² is [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

= [4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Hmm, comparing to our expression:

Our numerator is 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So,

Our numerator = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

D's numerator = k A^2 (4 c^2 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) ) /4 m^2 c^4 ?

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should plug in numbers to see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of small k A^2/(m c^2 ) case. Suppose k A² is much smaller than 2 m c^2, then:

In our expression, gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ). So, gamma_max is approximately 1 + some small term.

So, v_max^2/c^2 ≈ [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

With alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ~ small, so (1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 1 + 2 alpha.

2 alpha + alpha^2 ≈ 2 alpha.

So,

v²/c² ≈ (2 alpha )/(1 + 2 alpha ) ≈ 2 alpha (1 - 2 alpha ) ) = 2 alpha - 4 alpha².

But since alpha is small, v^2/c^2 ≈ 2 alpha = (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ).

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 /m ) ) = sqrt( k/m ) A.

Which is the classical result, as expected in the non-relativistic limit. So, the expression should reduce to the classical result when k A^2 is much less than m c^2. Looking at the options:

Option C is sqrt(k A²/m ), which is the classical result. So, in the limit where relativistic effects are small, option C is correct. But the question is about the relativistic case, so option C isn't the right answer.

Looking at the options again, let's check each one when k A^2 is small.

Option B: v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - x) ), where x is small. 1/(1-x) is approximately 1 + x. So sqrt( 2 + x ), which would be more than the classical result, which doesn't make sense in the limit.

Option D: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), where x is small. So, 1/(1+x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x. So,

1 - [1 -2x ] = 2x.

So, v^2/c^2 ≈ 2x = (k A^2)/(m c^2 ), so v ≈ sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2) ) c = sqrt( k A^2/m ), same as classical. So, option D matches the classical limit.

Similarly, option A: when x is small, 1/(1 - x )^2 ≈ 1 + 2x. So,

sqrt( 1 + 1/(1-x)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 1 + 1 + 2x ) = sqrt( 2 + 2x ), which would be larger than the classical speed. So, not matching the non-relativistic limit.

Option B: as before, it doesn't match.

So, option D matches the non-relativistic limit. So, perhaps option D is the correct answer.

Wait, let me compare our expression to option D.

Our expression for v²/c² is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Option D's expression is v_max²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ].

Which simplifies to:

[ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which becomes:

[ 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) - 1 ] / denominator.

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] / denominator.

Hmm. Let me compare this to our expression.

Our expression is:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

= [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 )

Option D's expression is:

[ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] 

= [ 4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So, denominator is 4 m² c^4.

Comparing to our expression:

Our numerator is 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

But option D's numerator is 4 k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4.

Only the first term differs by a factor of m.

Hmm, not the same. So perhaps option D is not the correct one.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the correct approach again.

Wait, another approach: in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is (d/dt)(gamma m v ) = -k x.

But x and v are related by v = dx/dt. So, this gives a differential equation. However, solving this would be complicated, and perhaps it's beyond my current capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the virial theorem. The virial theorem states that for a potential V(x) = (1/2) k x^2, the average kinetic energy is equal to the average potential energy. So, <KE> = <PE>.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma -1 ) m c^2. So, perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, and the potential is zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

Hmm. Maybe I should express the total energy as a sum of rest mass energy and potential energy, then set that equal to the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy when x=0.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. Because E_total is m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2, and at x=0, E_total = gamma m c^2.

So, gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before.

So, from gamma, we get v_max.

So, solving for v_max, we have:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = [1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/[1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Which is,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

= [ (1 + 2*(k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )) - 1 ] / denominator.

= [ (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / denominator.

Hmm, and the denominator is [1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Wait, but this expression seems to match option D.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which, when squared,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which is exactly the expression I derived.

So, yes, option D is the correct one.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \): 

\[
E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The total energy at this point is given by the relativistic energy expression:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we find:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression does not match the derived formula and introduces an incorrect denominator.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator inside the square root is dimensionally inconsistent with the derived formula.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. This matches the derived formula exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
