Okay, I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. So let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (like the energy due to some magnetic interaction) with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. B is given as 1 Tesla. The transition energy ΔE corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, wait a second. I'm a bit confused about the terms here. Paramagnetic coupling... Oh, right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect comes into play. The Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic coupling term is probably referring to the energy shift due to the magnetic field interacting with the atom's magnetic moment.

So the problem is asking me to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which would be the Zeeman energy) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The options are whether the Zeeman energy is much larger, much smaller, or similar in magnitude to ΔE.

First, I need to find expressions for both the paramagnetic coupling term (the Zeeman term) and the transition energy ΔE.

Let me start with the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is approximately the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. That transition is from n=3 to n=2, if I remember correctly. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

Wait, but for the transition energy, I think that's the energy difference between two energy levels, which is indeed given by the photon emitted during the transition. So I'll calculate ΔE as hc/λ.

Next, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy. The Zeeman effect energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

But wait, wait. In the case of the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is usually given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m_s, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Or perhaps it's more accurate to model it with the Hamiltonian term H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic field is along Oz, the z-axis, and the magnetic moment is proportional to m_s (the spin quantum number), the expectation value would be proportional to m_s B.

But wait, in the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, but for the paramagnetic effect (which is due to spin), it's the spin magnetic quantum number m_s. Oh, but the question says "small values of m"—wait, orbital m or spin m_s? Hmm, the question says "orbital magnetic quantum number m". That's a bit confusing because in the Zeeman effect, the orbital and spin contributions are separate. The paramagnetic term is usually the spin part. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling in this context might refer to the interaction of the magnetic moment due to orbital motion. No, wait, paramagnetism arises from the electron's spin magnetic moment. Oh, right, paramagnetism is due to the spin. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the spin-orbit interaction, but wait, no—the question states that the magnetic field is applied, so it's the Zeeman effect. So the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman term, which is proportional to the magnetic moment of the electron's spin in the applied B field.

So the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m_s, but wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c), but wait, let me think. The Bohr magneton is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. And the spin magnetic quantum number m_s can be ±1/2 for an electron.

But wait, for hydrogen, the ground state electron has spin 1/2, so m_s is ±1/2. So the maximum shift would be when m_s is ½, giving ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * (1/2).

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So perhaps we're considering the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by L = ħ m / (m_e c), or something like that.

Wait, let me clarify. The orbital magnetic moment μ_L is given by μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m / (l(l+1))^(1/2)). Wait, more accurately, μ_L = (μ_B) * (m) / (l(l+1))^(1/2)) * something. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of angular momentum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The paramagnetic term refers to the spin contribution, and the Zeeman effect could split the energy levels based on orbital or spin angular momentum. But in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the spin-orbit coupling is usually small compared to the Zeeman effect. But wait, in this case, perhaps the question is referring to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment, since it's talking about m (the orbital quantum number). So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy due to the orbital magnetic moment.

Wait, but paramagnetism is usually due to the spin, not the orbital motion. Oh, well, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed step by step.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field interacting with the magnetic moment of the electron. For the orbital part, the magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ c)^{-1} * ... No, wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (m) / (l(l+1))^{1/2} ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) * m / (l + ½), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the average value of the magnetic dipole moment for the orbital part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ · B. For orbital angular momentum, μ_L = (e/(2m_e)) * L / c. So H_Zeeman = - (e/(2m_e c)) * (L · B). Since B is along Oz, L · B is L_z B. So the expectation value would be (e B)/(2 m_e c) * <L_z>.

The expectation value of L_z is ℏ m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So <L_z> = m ℏ.

So putting it together, the energy shift due to the orbital Zeeman effect is:

ΔE_orbital = -(e B)/(2 m_e c) * <L_z> = -(e B)/(2 m_e c) * m ℏ.

Hmm, but wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is e ℏ/(2 m_e), so substituting that in:

ΔE_orbital = -(μ_B B) * m / c * (something). Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, e/(2 m_e c) * ℏ is μ_B/(c), because μ_B = e ℏ/(2 m_e). So:

ΔE_orbital = -(μ_B B) * (m)/(c) * (1/c?) Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy shift for orbital Zeeman effect is given by ΔE_orbital = (μ_B * B * m) / (something). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔE_orbital = μ_B * B * m / (l(l+1))^(1/2), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the g-factor. The orbital contribution to the magnetic moment has a g-factor of 1, whereas the spin has a g-factor of approximately 2 (the Landé g-factor for the electron is about 2). So the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = g_orbital * (μ_B) * m, where g_orbital ≈ 1.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The magnetic moment for orbital angular momentum is μ_L = (e/(2 m_e c)) * L, where L is the angular momentum. For a state with quantum numbers l and m, L_z = m ℏ. So:

μ_L = (e/(2 m_e c)) * m ℏ = (e ℏ m)/(2 m_e c) ) = μ_B * m / c.

Because μ_B = e ℏ/(2 m_e), so μ_L = μ_B * m / c.

So the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is ΔE_orbital = -μ_L · B. Since B is along Oz, μ_L is along Oz, so:

ΔE_orbital = - μ_L B = - (μ_B m / c) * B.

Wait, but energy is in joules, so let me compute the magnitude: |ΔE_orbital| = μ_B B m / c.

But wait, for the paramagnetic coupling term, perhaps we're considering the spin part. Because the question mentions small m. Wait, no, the question says that m is small. So for small m, the orbital term's contribution might be smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the spin magnetic moment. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the spin g-factor (approx 2). So the spin contribution would be:

ΔE_spin = μ_s B = g_s μ_B m_s B.

But since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum possible shift is (g_s μ_B B) * (1/2). For hydrogen, the ground state has m_s = ±1/2.

Wait, but the question says paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to unpaired electrons, and in hydrogen, the ground state has a single electron with spin ½, so the paramagnetic effect comes from the spin.

Hmm, but the question states that the paramagnetic coupling is the term to compare. So perhaps that refers to the spin contribution.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. Oh, wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So perhaps the orbital term is negligible because m is small. But wait, if m is small, say m=0, then the orbital term is zero. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling here refers to the spin term.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling is due to spin, so the energy shift would be on the order of g_s μ_B B (m_s), which is about 2 * μ_B * B * (1/2) = μ_B B.

Wait, that's if m_s is 1/2. So the energy shift would be approximately μ_B * B.

So let me compute both terms: the paramagnetic (spin) term and the transition energy ΔE.

First, compute the paramagnetic (spin) energy shift: E_p = μ_B * B.

Compute that:

μ_B ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J/T
B = 1 T
E_p ≈ (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, compute the transition energy ΔE.

The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. So:

c = 3e8 m/s
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
λ = 486.1e-9 m.

ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approx 4.089e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 4.089e-18 J.

Now, compare E_p and ΔE.

E_p is about 9.274e-24 J, and ΔE is ~4e-18 J. So E_p is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, because 1e-24 is much smaller than 1e-18. So the paramagnetic term (E_p) is much less than ΔE. So the expectation value of H (which is the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the correct option would be C: <H> << ΔE.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I compute E_p correctly?

Wait, E_p is the energy shift due to spin in the magnetic field. For m_s = ½, the energy shift is (g_s μ_B B) * (m_s). Wait, g_s is about 2, so:

E_p = (g_s μ_B B) * m_s = (2 * 9.274e-24 J/T) * (1 T) * (1/2) )= 9.274e-24 J, which matches earlier.

So yes, E_p is about 9e-24 J, while ΔE is about 4e-18 J. So 9e-24 is much less than 4e-18.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Thus, the correct answer is C: <H> << ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the energy shifts caused by the magnetic field and the photon emission during the transition.

### 1. Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)
The transition energy corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition in the hydrogen atom. It is calculated using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of the transition).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### 2. Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term refers to the energy shift due to the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the applied magnetic field \( B \). For the spin magnetic moment, the energy shift is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} = g_s \mu_B B m_s
\]

Where:
- \( g_s \approx 2 \) (spin g-factor),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field),
- \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) (spin magnetic quantum number).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} = (2)(9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### 3. Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 4.089 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{spin}} \) is approximately \( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \). Clearly, the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} \ll \Delta E.
\]

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy, so the correct option is:

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

Wait, but for the transition energy, I think that's the energy difference between two energy levels, which is indeed given by the photon emitted during the transition. So I'll calculate ΔE as hc/λ.

Next, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy. The Zeeman effect energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

But wait, wait. In the case of the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is usually given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m_s, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Or perhaps it's more accurate to model it with the Hamiltonian term H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic field is along Oz, the z-axis, and the magnetic moment is proportional to m_s (the spin quantum number), the expectation value would be proportional to m_s B.

But wait, in the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, but for the paramagnetic effect (which is due to spin), it's the spin magnetic quantum number m_s. Oh, but the question says "small values of m"—wait, orbital m or spin m_s? Hmm, the question says "orbital magnetic quantum number m". That's a bit confusing because in the Zeeman effect, the orbital and spin contributions are separate. The paramagnetic term is usually the spin part. So I'm a bit confused now.

So the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m_s, but wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c), but wait, let me think. The Bohr magneton is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. And the spin magnetic quantum number m_s can be ±1/2 for an electron.

But wait, for hydrogen, the ground state electron has spin 1/2, so m_s is ±1/2. So the maximum shift would be when m_s is ½, giving ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * (1/2).

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So perhaps we're considering the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by L = ħ m / (m_e c), or something like that.

Wait, let me clarify. The orbital magnetic moment μ_L is given by μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m / (l(l+1))^(1/2)). Wait, more accurately, μ_L = (μ_B) * (m) / (l(l+1))^(1/2)) * something. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of angular momentum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I've heard that the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) * m / (l + ½), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the average value of the magnetic dipole moment for the orbital part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ · B. For orbital angular momentum, μ_L = (e/(2m_e)) * L / c. So H_Zeeman = - (e/(2m_e c)) * (L · B). Since B is along Oz, L · B is L_z B. So the expectation value would be (e B)/(2 m_e c) * <L_z>.

The expectation value of L_z is ℏ m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So <L_z> = m ℏ.

So putting it together, the energy shift due to the orbital Zeeman effect is:

ΔE_orbital = -(e B)/(2 m_e c) * <L_z> = -(e B)/(2 m_e c) * m ℏ.

Hmm, but wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is e ℏ/(2 m_e), so substituting that in:

ΔE_orbital = -(μ_B B) * m / c * (something). Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, e/(2 m_e c) * ℏ is μ_B/(c), because μ_B = e ℏ/(2 m_e). So:

ΔE_orbital = -(μ_B B) * (m)/(c) * (1/c?) Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy shift for orbital Zeeman effect is given by ΔE_orbital = (μ_B * B * m) / (something). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔE_orbital = μ_B * B * m / (l(l+1))^(1/2), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the g-factor. The orbital contribution to the magnetic moment has a g-factor of 1, whereas the spin has a g-factor of approximately 2 (the Landé g-factor for the electron is about 2). So the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = g_orbital * (μ_B) * m, where g_orbital ≈ 1.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The magnetic moment for orbital angular momentum is μ_L = (e/(2 m_e c)) * L, where L is the angular momentum. For a state with quantum numbers l and m, L_z = m ℏ. So:

μ_L = (e/(2 m_e c)) * m ℏ = (e ℏ m)/(2 m_e c) ) = μ_B * m / c.

Because μ_B = e ℏ/(2 m_e), so μ_L = μ_B * m / c.

So the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is ΔE_orbital = -μ_L · B. Since B is along Oz, μ_L is along Oz, so:

ΔE_orbital = - μ_L B = - (μ_B m / c) * B.

Wait, but energy is in joules, so let me compute the magnitude: |ΔE_orbital| = μ_B B m / c.

But wait, for the paramagnetic coupling term, perhaps we're considering the spin part. Because the question mentions small m. Wait, no, the question says that m is small. So for small m, the orbital term's contribution might be smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the spin magnetic moment. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the spin g-factor (approx 2). So the spin contribution would be:

ΔE_spin = μ_s B = g_s μ_B m_s B.

But since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum possible shift is (g_s μ_B B) * (1/2). For hydrogen, the ground state has m_s = ±1/2.

Wait, but the question says paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to unpaired electrons, and in hydrogen, the ground state has a single electron with spin ½, so the paramagnetic effect comes from the spin.

Hmm, but the question states that the paramagnetic coupling is the term to compare. So perhaps that refers to the spin contribution.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. Oh, wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So perhaps the orbital term is negligible because m is small. But wait, if m is small, say m=0, then the orbital term is zero. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling here refers to the spin term.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling is due to spin, so the energy shift would be on the order of g_s μ_B B (m_s), which is about 2 * μ_B * B * (1/2) = μ_B B.

Wait, that's if m_s is 1/2. So the energy shift would be approximately μ_B * B.

So let me compute both terms: the paramagnetic (spin) term and the transition energy ΔE.

First, compute the paramagnetic (spin) energy shift: E_p = μ_B * B.

Compute that:

μ_B ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J/T
B = 1 T
E_p ≈ (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, compute the transition energy ΔE.

The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. So:

c = 3e8 m/s
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
λ = 486.1e-9 m.

ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approx 4.089e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 4.089e-18 J.

Now, compare E_p and ΔE.

E_p is about 9.274e-24 J, and ΔE is ~4e-18 J. So E_p is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, because 1e-24 is much smaller than 1e-18. So the paramagnetic term (E_p) is much less than ΔE. So the expectation value of H (which is the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the correct option would be C: <H> << ΔE.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I compute E_p correctly?

Wait, E_p is the energy shift due to spin in the magnetic field. For m_s = ½, the energy shift is (g_s μ_B B) * (m_s). Wait, g_s is about 2, so:

E_p = (g_s μ_B B) * m_s = (2 * 9.274e-24 J/T) * (1 T) * (1/2) )= 9.274e-24 J, which matches earlier.

So yes, E_p is about 9e-24 J, while ΔE is about 4e-18 J. So 9e-24 is much less than 4e-18.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Thus, the correct answer is C: <H> << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the energy shifts caused by the magnetic field and the photon emission during the transition.

### 1. Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)
The transition energy corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition in the hydrogen atom. It is calculated using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of the transition).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### 2. Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term refers to the energy shift due to the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the applied magnetic field \( B \). For the spin magnetic moment, the energy shift is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} = g_s \mu_B B m_s
\]

Where:
- \( g_s \approx 2 \) (spin g-factor),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field),
- \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) (spin magnetic quantum number).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} = (2)(9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### 3. Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 4.089 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{spin}} \) is approximately \( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \). Clearly, the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{spin}} \ll \Delta E.
\]

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy, so the correct option is:
