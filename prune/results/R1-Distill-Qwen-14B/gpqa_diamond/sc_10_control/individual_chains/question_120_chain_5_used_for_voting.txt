Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me read it again.

The question says: Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax values. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, wait: higher parallax means closer because the star's apparent position shifts more when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. So yes, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars in space is constant. Let's say the number density n is constant, so the number of stars in a volume V is n * V.

Now, how does parallax relate to volume? Well, for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Since plx = 1/d, the distance d is 1/plx. So a change in plx corresponds to a change in d. Let's think about the volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd.

The volume between two spheres is the difference between the volumes of two concentric spheres. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume difference ΔV between d and d+dd is (4/3)π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). Expanding that, (d + dd)^3 = d³ + 3d² dd + 3d (dd)^2 + (dd)^3. But since dd is a small change, the higher order terms (like terms with (dd)^2 and (dd)^3) are negligible. So ΔV ≈ (4/3)π [3d² dd] = 4π d² dd.

Wait, that's the volume between two distances d and d+dd. So for a given distance interval, the volume is proportional to d squared times the distance change.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how the number of stars depends on plx, which is inversely related to d.

So, let's express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. Let’s call plx = p. So d = 1/p, and dd (the change in d) would be related to the change in p. Let's find dd in terms of dp (the change in parallax).

Since d = 1/p, dd = -1/p² dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can ignore the sign for this purpose.

So, the volume ΔV is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p² dp) )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, let me recheck. d=1/p so d squared is 1/p². And dd is -1/p² dp. So when I plug into ΔV: 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, because the volume is 4π d² dd. Since dd is the change in d for a change in p, perhaps I should express ΔV in terms of p and dp.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express the volume between two parallax values. Because the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range.

So, for a given parallax interval, say from p to p + dp, what is the corresponding distance interval, and hence the volume.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's write the number of stars in a thin shell between p and p+dp. The shell is at a distance d = 1/p. The shell's thickness in distance is dd, which depends on dp.

So, first, find the relationship between dp and dd. Since d = 1/p, dd = (-1/p²) dp. The negative indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but for the volume, we take the magnitude, so we can write dd = (1/p²) dp.

Now, the volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd is the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4π d², so the volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d=1/p, that becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp. That would imply that the volume element in terms of p is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, how does this relate to the number of stars? The number of stars in that volume would be the number density n multiplied by the volume. So N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small dp, the number is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Therefore, the number per unit parallax (dp) is roughly N/(dp) = n *4π (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because I remember that when you have a uniform distribution in space, the number of stars at a distance d to d + dd is proportional to d² dd. But here, we're integrating in terms of parallax, so the dependence changes.

Let me think again: the number of stars at a distance d is proportional to the surface area at that distance (since the volume in space is a spherical shell, and the number of stars is the surface area times the number density, since the shell's thickness is dd and the volume is 4π d² dd). So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d².

But when considering parallax, which is p = 1/d, we have d = 1/p. So substituting, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to (1/p)^2. But wait, that's per unit distance. But the question is about per unit parallax. So I think I need to express this in terms of p.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the number of stars in a small interval of parallax, say between p and p + dp.

Each star at a parallax p is at a distance d = 1/p. The number of stars in the range p to p + dp is the number density n multiplied by the volume of the shell between d and d + dd, where dd is the change in d corresponding to dp.

So, let's find dd in terms of dp. Since d = 1/p, dd = (-1/p²) dp. So the absolute change is |dd| = 1/p² dp.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is (n *4π / p^4) stars per (unit p).

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think again. Because when the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. So as we move to higher parallax (which means closer stars), the volume element in terms of parallax changes.

Wait, maybe I should consider the differential volume in terms of parallax. Let me express the volume between p and p + dp.

The volume for a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/p, and dd = (1/p²) dp, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. Thus, the number per unit parallax is (n *4π) (1/p^4).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I remember that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. So for a uniform distribution, the number of stars at a certain distance would depend on the volume around that distance.

Wait, but another approach: The number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is equal to the number of stars in the volume between d=1/p and d=1/(p+dp). But perhaps it's easier to do the calculation in terms of differential elements.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to the number density multiplied by the volume per unit parallax. So dN/dp = n * 4π d^2 * (dd/dp).

Since d = 1/p, dd/dp = -1/p², and since we're considering the magnitude, it's 1/p².

So dN/dp = n *4 π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) ) = n * 4 π (1/p^4).

So yes, that's the same as earlier.

So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density \( n \) of stars is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell between distances \( d \) and \( d + dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

To express the volume in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (ignoring the sign for magnitude). The volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\Delta V = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \( n \Delta V \), which gives:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by \( dp \), resulting in:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/p^4 \).

So a change in plx corresponds to a change in d. Let's think about the volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd.

The volume between two spheres is the difference between the volumes of two concentric spheres. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume difference ΔV between d and d+dd is (4/3)π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). Expanding that, (d + dd)^3 = d³ + 3d² dd + 3d (dd)^2 + (dd)^3. But since dd is a small change, the higher order terms (like terms with (dd)^2 and (dd)^3) are negligible. So ΔV ≈ (4/3)π [3d² dd] = 4π d² dd.

Wait, that's the volume between two distances d and d+dd. So for a given distance interval, the volume is proportional to d squared times the distance change.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how the number of stars depends on plx, which is inversely related to d.

So, let's express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. Let’s call plx = p. So d = 1/p, and dd (the change in d) would be related to the change in p. Let's find dd in terms of dp (the change in parallax).

Since d = 1/p, dd = -1/p² dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can ignore the sign for this purpose.

So, the volume ΔV is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p² dp) )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, let me recheck. d=1/p so d squared is 1/p². And dd is -1/p² dp. So when I plug into ΔV: 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, because the volume is 4π d² dd. Since dd is the change in d for a change in p, perhaps I should express ΔV in terms of p and dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d=1/p, that becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp. That would imply that the volume element in terms of p is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small dp, the number is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Therefore, the number per unit parallax (dp) is roughly N/(dp) = n *4π (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4.

So, let's find dd in terms of dp. Since d = 1/p, dd = (-1/p²) dp. So the absolute change is |dd| = 1/p² dp.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is (n *4π / p^4) stars per (unit p).

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think again. Because when the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. So as we move to higher parallax (which means closer stars), the volume element in terms of parallax changes.

Wait, maybe I should consider the differential volume in terms of parallax. Let me express the volume between p and p + dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. Thus, the number per unit parallax is (n *4π) (1/p^4).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I remember that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. So for a uniform distribution, the number of stars at a certain distance would depend on the volume around that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to the number density multiplied by the volume per unit parallax. So dN/dp = n * 4π d^2 * (dd/dp).

Since d = 1/p, dd/dp = -1/p², and since we're considering the magnitude, it's 1/p².

So dN/dp = n *4 π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) ) = n * 4 π (1/p^4).

So yes, that's the same as earlier.

So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is option A.
