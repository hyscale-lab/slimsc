Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's asking about two specific compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The question has two parts: Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options given are combinations of these answers for parts A and B.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, usually adjacent ones, leading to different structures called tautomers. This often happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or in cases where a hydrogen is adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone can have tautomerism. Wait, no—I might be mixing it up. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Does it have any sites where tautomerism can occur? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one to consider. That compound has three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. All adjacent. Do they have any possibility for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen between two adjacent atoms, like in enol and keto forms. For that, the compound should have a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls, but they are conjugated. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no. Benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups opposite each other, like para-quinone. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. 

Does this structure have any alpha hydrogens? Let me think. Each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to the ring. The ring has only one substituent (the O). So, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4 (para positions), and the adjacent carbons (like 2 and 6) would be connected to the ring but not to any hydrogens that can tautomerize. Because those positions are already part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated, so I don't think there are any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because there are no alpha hydrogens available.

Wait, wait. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So the ring is benzene with two ketone groups at para positions. Each of these ketones is directly attached to the ring. So the adjacent carbons (on the ring) are each bonded to two other carbons (since benzene is a six-membered ring). So those adjacent positions don't have any hydrogens because they're part of the aromatic ring. So there are no hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups. Because, in a benzene ring, each carbon is part of the conjugated pi system, so the adjacent carbons have no H's attached. Therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because there are no H's to shift.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a ring. So, each ketone is separated by a single carbon. Now, each of those ketone groups is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. The ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon is bonded to two others. The 1,3,5 positions have carbonyl groups. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in the ring. Wait, no, that can't be right because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, which are every other position. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to a CH2 group on either side. So each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl.

Therefore, each of those CH2 groups has hydrogens on carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, those hydrogens are alpha to the carbonyl. Therefore, this structure would have alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait—tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from one carbon to another, which would require a conjugated system.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, for example, the carbonyl at position 1 is next to position 2, which is CH2. So the H's on position 2 are alpha to the carbonyl. So, any of those H's can potentially undergo tautomerism. But wait, tautomerism usually occurs in conjugated systems, like in enols and keto forms in ketones.

Wait, but in this case, each carbonyl group is separated by a CH2 group. So, for example, between two carbonyls, there is a CH2. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2..., no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring, which would make sense. So each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups that are part of the ring.

In that case, each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl has H's that are alpha. So, the compound can undergo tautomerism because the H is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, and such H can shift, leading to a different structure.

Wait, but wait. For tautomerism to occur, you need adjacent H's and a double bond. Like in the case of keto-enol tautomerism. So, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a ring, and the adjacent carbons are CH2. So, in each CH2, there are H's. So, perhaps, the H's can shift from the CH2 to the adjacent carbonyl, forming an enol form. So, this would imply that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and A = benzoquinone.

Earlier, I thought benzoquinone doesn't have alpha H's because the H's are part of the aromatic ring, so no. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, so if benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent positions are already part of the aromatic ring (so no H's on those carbons), then it can't undergo tautomerism.

So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So A = benzoquinone.

Now, moving on to part B. The compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. I need to determine which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or has a plane of symmetry or other factors leading to enantiomers.

First, let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester. The structure is:

The parent acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which esterified with methanol. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, more accurately, the structure is: the ester group is OMe (OCH3), attached to the carbonyl. The alpha carbon (carbon next to carbonyl) has the hydroxyl group and two CH3 groups?

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When it esterifies, the -OH on the second carbon (the alpha carbon) becomes a hydroxyl group, and the COOH becomes COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate part is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it:

The structure is CH2CH2? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO— but wait, no. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon (the middle carbon). So the structure would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, that's for 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Let's number the carbons: 1 is the COOH group, 2 is the middle, 3 is the methyl. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, the correct structure is: the ester is OMe connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another CH3.

Wait, another approach: The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon) has OH, CH3 (from the first carbon), COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. So that central carbon is attached to four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the fourth group is a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The central carbon is connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: OH and COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

The chain is: CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the fourth group is the hydrogen attached to the central carbon.

Wait, so the central carbon has four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diacid, with two double bonds. Its structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with a double bond between the two central carbons. When it forms dimethyl fumarate, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3? No, wait. No, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So, structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, actually, the structure is:

The central two carbons are double bonded (CH=CH), with each end connected to a COOCH3 group.

So, the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be (MeO2C)-CH=CH-(MeO2C). So each end is a methyl ester.

Now, does this structure have any chiral centers?

The central two carbons are double bonded. Each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other carbons. Let's look at each of the CH groups.

Wait, each CH in CH=CH. So, each of those CH's has two COOCH3 groups attached, but wait, no. Each CH is attached to one COOCH3 group on either side.

Wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as:

The molecule is CH(CH2COOCH3)2-CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let's think of it as:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, perhaps another approach. Fumarate is a substituted maleate. Structure is:

The two carbonyl groups are at the ends, connected by a double bond in the middle.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, the central two carbons are double bonded, each connected to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group? No, wait, each of the central carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be right because each central carbon can only have four bonds.

Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate would have the structure O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

No, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other CH groups?

Wait, no. Each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side
- Another CH on the other side.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to draw it mentally. Fumarate has the structure:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So, the structure becomes:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and another CH.

Wait, each of the CH=CH carbons has a double bond between them. So, each of these carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (the other double bonded carbon)
- One hydrogen?

Wait, no, maybe each CH has two substituents. Let me clarify:

The structure is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - COOCH3? No, that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is not fumarate.

No, fumarate is a diester with a double bond.

So, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the CH=CH carbons has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (the other end of the double bond)
- Two H's?

Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond (CH=CH) has two substituents besides the double bond. So, each carbon would have one COOCH3 group and one H. Wait, no, because each CH is only bonded to two other atoms besides the double bond. Let me think: each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One hydrogen
- And the double bond.

Wait, no, that would mean each carbon has three bonds, which isn't possible. So wait, each CH in the double bond is bonded to:

- Two other carbons (from the ester groups) and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that each CH is connected to a COOCH3, another CH (double bond), and two H's.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to one COOCH3 and two H's, making them CH2 groups but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, fumarate is a trans-diacid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to two groups: one COOCH3 and one H, right? Or wait, no.

Wait, each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And is double bonded to the other CH.

Wait, but each CH is connected to only two substituents and the double bond. So each CH would be CH2? No, because in CH=CH, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

No, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. In that case, each CH would have a COOCH3, a H, and be double bonded to the other CH, making each CH a CH2 group but with a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH would have three bonds.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right because fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's succinate, not fumarate.

Fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons.

So, each of those central carbons is bonded to the COOCH3 groups and each other via a double bond.

So structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 (but with a double bond between the two CH2's, but I'm not getting that right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each COOCH3 is attached to a CH, which is double bonded to another CH, which is attached to another COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So each of the CH's in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH group (from the double bond)
- And two H's?

Wait, no, because a CH can't have two H's if it's part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3 and one H, and the rest are double bonds.

Wait, no, each CH is bonded to two other atoms in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a H. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And two bonds in the double bond.

But wait, each CH has four bonds. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a central double bond (CH=CH), and each of these carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons would have the structure CH (connected to COOCH3 and H), but because they're part of a double bond, each has two substituents besides the double bond. So each CH is attached to COOCH3, H, and is double bonded to another CH.

Wait, but that would mean each of these carbons has two substituents in addition to the double bond: COOCH3 and H.

So, the substituents are COOCH3, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent in itself). No, wait, the substituents for each carbon are COOCH3 and H, and the double bond is between the two carbons.

So, each of the carbons in the double bond is bonded to COOCH3, H, and the other carbon via double bond.

So, each of these carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond (but that's a single substituent in terms of bonding).

Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond, because each has four bonds.

So, for each CH in the double bond, let's say, each is attached to COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a meso form. Let me think about the possibility of internal planes of symmetry.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, if that's the case, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, let's think: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, the two substituents (COOCH3 and COOCH3) are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure again.

Suppose the structure is:

COOCH3-C double bond C-COOCH3.

Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Wait, no, each is connected to COOCH3 and, perhaps, another substituent.

Wait, no, perhaps each is connected to COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's succinate.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of this incorrectly. Another approach: When a molecule has a double bond, if the substituents on either end are identical and arranged symmetrically, it might be achiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, it's a trans configuration. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical across the plane of the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you have a double bond with two identical groups on either end and arranged symmetrically, it's a meso compound and thus achiral. For example, meso-tartaric acid.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH(CH2COOCH3)2 with a double bond. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each end of the double bond is a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH groups is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 (but with a double bond between the two CH2's). So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2's.

Wait, but that would make it MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2's, making it MeOOC-CH2=CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would change the connectivity. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently. If the molecule is symmetrical, like having a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on either end, across a double bond in a trans configuration. So, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would be symmetrical in a way that a mirror plane exists, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Let's think about the actual structure. If each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and another group, perhaps a hydrogen, then each carbon would have the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the molecule. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) are double-bonded. Each is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2's.

Wait, no, but that would be a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each CH has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group attached. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans.

But regardless, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it can't have optical isomerism.

Another thought: Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond but no chiral centers. Because, each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, but in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, let me think again. If a molecule has a double bond and substituents on either end are the same and arranged symmetrically, it's not chiral. For example, (E)-but-2-ene with identical groups on each end (like two CH3) would be symmetric and not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no, each end has a COOCH3 and perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, then the substituents would be different.

Wait, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but that would make the substituents different, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of a specific example. Take the structure of dimethyl fumarate as MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, each CH would have a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, but in that case, each carbon would have the same groups, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, if each CH is attached to COOCH3 and H, then each CH has the same substituents, making the molecule symmetric across the double bond. So, no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

But wait, in that case, each CH would have two substituents, but perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier, I thought that compound has a chiral center. So, it does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together:

A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism: benzoquinone.

B is the compound that shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, no. Option D says B = dimethyl fumarate, which we've determined doesn't show optical isomerism. So, that's not correct.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's correct.

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., which we think does have tautomerism, so A can't be that. So option A is incorrect.

Option C: A = cyclohexane..., which can't be right because A is the one without tautomerism. So, no.

So, the correct answer is option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound has alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can shift between carbons, forming enol and keto tautomers. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups in a benzene ring at para positions. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH2 groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift, allowing for tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or other asymmetrical features.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, H, and OH. This makes it a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's asking about two specific compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The question has two parts: Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options given are combinations of these answers for parts A and B.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, usually adjacent ones, leading to different structures called tautomers. This often happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or in cases where a hydrogen is adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone can have tautomerism. Wait, no—I might be mixing it up. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Does it have any sites where tautomerism can occur? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one to consider. That compound has three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. All adjacent. Do they have any possibility for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen between two adjacent atoms, like in enol and keto forms. For that, the compound should have a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls, but they are conjugated. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no. Benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups opposite each other, like para-quinone. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. 

Does this structure have any alpha hydrogens? Let me think. Each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to the ring. The ring has only one substituent (the O). So, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4 (para positions), and the adjacent carbons (like 2 and 6) would be connected to the ring but not to any hydrogens that can tautomerize. Because those positions are already part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated, so I don't think there are any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because there are no alpha hydrogens available.

Wait, wait. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So the ring is benzene with two ketone groups at para positions. Each of these ketones is directly attached to the ring. So the adjacent carbons (on the ring) are each bonded to two other carbons (since benzene is a six-membered ring). So those adjacent positions don't have any hydrogens because they're part of the aromatic ring. So there are no hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups. Because, in a benzene ring, each carbon is part of the conjugated pi system, so the adjacent carbons have no H's attached. Therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because there are no H's to shift.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a ring. So, each ketone is separated by a single carbon. Now, each of those ketone groups is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. The ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon is bonded to two others. The 1,3,5 positions have carbonyl groups. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in the ring. Wait, no, that can't be right because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, which are every other position. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to a CH2 group on either side. So each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl.

Therefore, each of those CH2 groups has hydrogens on carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, those hydrogens are alpha to the carbonyl. Therefore, this structure would have alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait—tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from one carbon to another, which would require a conjugated system.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, for example, the carbonyl at position 1 is next to position 2, which is CH2. So the H's on position 2 are alpha to the carbonyl. So, any of those H's can potentially undergo tautomerism. But wait, tautomerism usually occurs in conjugated systems, like in enols and keto forms in ketones.

Wait, but in this case, each carbonyl group is separated by a CH2 group. So, for example, between two carbonyls, there is a CH2. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2..., no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring, which would make sense. So each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups that are part of the ring.

In that case, each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl has H's that are alpha. So, the compound can undergo tautomerism because the H is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, and such H can shift, leading to a different structure.

Wait, but wait. For tautomerism to occur, you need adjacent H's and a double bond. Like in the case of keto-enol tautomerism. So, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a ring, and the adjacent carbons are CH2. So, in each CH2, there are H's. So, perhaps, the H's can shift from the CH2 to the adjacent carbonyl, forming an enol form. So, this would imply that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and A = benzoquinone.

Earlier, I thought benzoquinone doesn't have alpha H's because the H's are part of the aromatic ring, so no. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, so if benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent positions are already part of the aromatic ring (so no H's on those carbons), then it can't undergo tautomerism.

So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So A = benzoquinone.

Now, moving on to part B. The compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. I need to determine which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or has a plane of symmetry or other factors leading to enantiomers.

First, let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester. The structure is:

The parent acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which esterified with methanol. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, more accurately, the structure is: the ester group is OMe (OCH3), attached to the carbonyl. The alpha carbon (carbon next to carbonyl) has the hydroxyl group and two CH3 groups?

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When it esterifies, the -OH on the second carbon (the alpha carbon) becomes a hydroxyl group, and the COOH becomes COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate part is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it:

The structure is CH2CH2? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO— but wait, no. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon (the middle carbon). So the structure would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, that's for 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Let's number the carbons: 1 is the COOH group, 2 is the middle, 3 is the methyl. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, the correct structure is: the ester is OMe connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another CH3.

Wait, another approach: The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon) has OH, CH3 (from the first carbon), COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. So that central carbon is attached to four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the fourth group is a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The central carbon is connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: OH and COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

The chain is: CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the fourth group is the hydrogen attached to the central carbon.

Wait, so the central carbon has four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diacid, with two double bonds. Its structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with a double bond between the two central carbons. When it forms dimethyl fumarate, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3? No, wait. No, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So, structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, actually, the structure is:

The central two carbons are double bonded (CH=CH), with each end connected to a COOCH3 group.

So, the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be (MeO2C)-CH=CH-(MeO2C). So each end is a methyl ester.

Now, does this structure have any chiral centers?

The central two carbons are double bonded. Each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other carbons. Let's look at each of the CH groups.

Wait, each CH in CH=CH. So, each of those CH's has two COOCH3 groups attached, but wait, no. Each CH is attached to one COOCH3 group on either side.

Wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as:

The molecule is CH(CH2COOCH3)2-CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let's think of it as:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, perhaps another approach. Fumarate is a substituted maleate. Structure is:

The two carbonyl groups are at the ends, connected by a double bond in the middle.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, the central two carbons are double bonded, each connected to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group? No, wait, each of the central carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be right because each central carbon can only have four bonds.

Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate would have the structure O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

No, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other CH groups?

Wait, no. Each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on one side
- Another CH on the other side.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to draw it mentally. Fumarate has the structure:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So, the structure becomes:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, each of the CH=CH carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and another CH.

Wait, each of the CH=CH carbons has a double bond between them. So, each of these carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (the other double bonded carbon)
- One hydrogen?

Wait, no, maybe each CH has two substituents. Let me clarify:

The structure is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - COOCH3? No, that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is not fumarate.

No, fumarate is a diester with a double bond.

So, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the CH=CH carbons has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (the other end of the double bond)
- Two H's?

Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond (CH=CH) has two substituents besides the double bond. So, each carbon would have one COOCH3 group and one H. Wait, no, because each CH is only bonded to two other atoms besides the double bond. Let me think: each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One hydrogen
- And the double bond.

Wait, no, that would mean each carbon has three bonds, which isn't possible. So wait, each CH in the double bond is bonded to:

- Two other carbons (from the ester groups) and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that each CH is connected to a COOCH3, another CH (double bond), and two H's.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to one COOCH3 and two H's, making them CH2 groups but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, fumarate is a trans-diacid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to two groups: one COOCH3 and one H, right? Or wait, no.

Wait, each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And is double bonded to the other CH.

Wait, but each CH is connected to only two substituents and the double bond. So each CH would be CH2? No, because in CH=CH, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

No, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. In that case, each CH would have a COOCH3, a H, and be double bonded to the other CH, making each CH a CH2 group but with a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH would have three bonds.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right because fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's succinate, not fumarate.

Fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons.

So, each of those central carbons is bonded to the COOCH3 groups and each other via a double bond.

So structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 (but with a double bond between the two CH2's, but I'm not getting that right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each COOCH3 is attached to a CH, which is double bonded to another CH, which is attached to another COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So each of the CH's in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH group (from the double bond)
- And two H's?

Wait, no, because a CH can't have two H's if it's part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3 and one H, and the rest are double bonds.

Wait, no, each CH is bonded to two other atoms in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a H. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And two bonds in the double bond.

But wait, each CH has four bonds. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a central double bond (CH=CH), and each of these carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons would have the structure CH (connected to COOCH3 and H), but because they're part of a double bond, each has two substituents besides the double bond. So each CH is attached to COOCH3, H, and is double bonded to another CH.

Wait, but that would mean each of these carbons has two substituents in addition to the double bond: COOCH3 and H.

So, the substituents are COOCH3, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent in itself). No, wait, the substituents for each carbon are COOCH3 and H, and the double bond is between the two carbons.

So, each of the carbons in the double bond is bonded to COOCH3, H, and the other carbon via double bond.

So, each of these carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond (but that's a single substituent in terms of bonding).

Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond, because each has four bonds.

So, for each CH in the double bond, let's say, each is attached to COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a meso form. Let me think about the possibility of internal planes of symmetry.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, if that's the case, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, let's think: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, the two substituents (COOCH3 and COOCH3) are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure again.

Suppose the structure is:

COOCH3-C double bond C-COOCH3.

Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Wait, no, each is connected to COOCH3 and, perhaps, another substituent.

Wait, no, perhaps each is connected to COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's succinate.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of this incorrectly. Another approach: When a molecule has a double bond, if the substituents on either end are identical and arranged symmetrically, it might be achiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, it's a trans configuration. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical across the plane of the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you have a double bond with two identical groups on either end and arranged symmetrically, it's a meso compound and thus achiral. For example, meso-tartaric acid.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH(CH2COOCH3)2 with a double bond. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each end of the double bond is a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH groups is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 (but with a double bond between the two CH2's). So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2's.

Wait, but that would make it MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2's, making it MeOOC-CH2=CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would change the connectivity. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently. If the molecule is symmetrical, like having a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on either end, across a double bond in a trans configuration. So, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would be symmetrical in a way that a mirror plane exists, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Let's think about the actual structure. If each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and another group, perhaps a hydrogen, then each carbon would have the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the molecule. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) are double-bonded. Each is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2's.

Wait, no, but that would be a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each CH has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group attached. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans.

But regardless, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it can't have optical isomerism.

Another thought: Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond but no chiral centers. Because, each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, but in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, let me think again. If a molecule has a double bond and substituents on either end are the same and arranged symmetrically, it's not chiral. For example, (E)-but-2-ene with identical groups on each end (like two CH3) would be symmetric and not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no, each end has a COOCH3 and perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. No, then the substituents would be different.

Wait, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but that would make the substituents different, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of a specific example. Take the structure of dimethyl fumarate as MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each of the CH=CH carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, each CH would have a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, but in that case, each carbon would have the same groups, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, if each CH is attached to COOCH3 and H, then each CH has the same substituents, making the molecule symmetric across the double bond. So, no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

But wait, in that case, each CH would have two substituents, but perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier, I thought that compound has a chiral center. So, it does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together:

A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism: benzoquinone.

B is the compound that shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, no. Option D says B = dimethyl fumarate, which we've determined doesn't show optical isomerism. So, that's not correct.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's correct.

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., which we think does have tautomerism, so A can't be that. So option A is incorrect.

Option C: A = cyclohexane..., which can't be right because A is the one without tautomerism. So, no.

So, the correct answer is option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound has alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can shift between carbons, forming enol and keto tautomers. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups in a benzene ring at para positions. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH2 groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift, allowing for tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or other asymmetrical features.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, H, and OH. This makes it a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
