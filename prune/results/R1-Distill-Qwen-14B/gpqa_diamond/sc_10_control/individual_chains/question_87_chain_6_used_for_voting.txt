Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with an aromatic compound. Hmm, let's see. The question says that I prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound, and the total number of carbon atoms is 8. Oh, wait, aromatic ring with 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons because 6+2=8. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and another is one. Wait, no, di-substituted means two substituents, so each substituent can be a single carbon or more.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Oh, wait, but wait: the question mentions an aromatic-halogen bond. So, that's a halogen attached directly to the ring, like Cl, Br, etc.

So the molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is a carbonyl group, perhaps in a substituent like an acyl group or maybe a ketone or something else.

Wait, but wait: the carbonyl could be part of another substituent. Let me think. Common substituents with carbonyl groups on aromatic rings are things like -COOR (ester), -COR (acyl), -NO2, etc. But since one substituent is a halogen, the other must contain the carbonyl.

So, the structure could be something like para-substituted benzene with a Cl and a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. But wait, the total carbons must be 8, so the ring has 6 carbons. So substituents add up to 2 carbons. Wait, that can't be. Because if each substituent is a single carbon, two substituents would add two carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a Cl (no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. Let me think.

Wait, the total carbons in the molecule are 8. The ring has 6 carbons. So the substituents must have 2 carbons in total. So substituent 1 is a Cl (no carbons), substituent 2 is an O=C-O-R group? No, wait. Or substituent 2 is a carbonyl group with another carbon, like maybe a ketone substituent. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone group. For example, a substituent could be a carbonyl attached to a methyl group, like a -COCH3 group. That's two carbons (C=O and CH3). So that would make the substituents Cl and COCH3. But wait, that's two substituents: Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. So the molecule is benzene with Cl and COCH3 attached. But wait, that would make the total carbons 6 (ring) + 3 (COCH3) = 9, plus Cl which is not a carbon. Hmm, that's 9 carbons but the question says 8. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, substituent could be a carbonyl group with only one carbon, but that's not possible. Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl attached to a single carbon, like a ketone, but then where's the other substituent?

Wait, maybe the substituents are Cl and CO-R, where R has one carbon. Let's see. For example, substituents could be Cl and -COCH2 something. Wait, but let me count again. If benzene has 6 carbons, substituent 1 is Cl (0 carbons), substituent 2 is O=C-O-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are Cl and a methylene group attached to a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe an acetyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group. For example, a substituent could be -OOCR where R is CH3. So, that's -O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR options and see which one fits. Let's go through the options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

A singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO), but wait, aromatic rings with aldehyde groups are possible. But wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl peak, so aldehyde (C=O) could fit. But in that case, the substituent would be an aldehyde group. But aldehyde is -CHO, which is one substituent. Then the other substituent would be Cl or Br.

Wait, but an aldehyde group on a benzene ring would typically show a triplet of triplets or something else in the aromatic region, but let's look at the NMR data.

In option A, the aromatic protons are two doublets: 7.8 and 7.6, each integrating 2H. So perhaps a para-substituted pattern with two substituents. But if there's an aldehyde group, that's another substituent. Wait, but the ring is only di-substituted. So, maybe the substituents are aldehyde and Cl. Wait, but then what about the 3.7 ppm singlet integrating 2H? That's a singlet, which suggests equivalent protons, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2O or something. Wait, but that would be for a group like -OCH2O-. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like geminal diastereotopic protons, perhaps from an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether or ester. Wait, 4.8 and 4.6 are both doublets, suggesting coupling to each other. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet of 3H, perhaps a methyl group attached to something. Wait, but this doesn't seem to fit with the aromatic ring. Maybe this option is about a di-substituted ethylene group, but the question is about an aromatic compound. So maybe option B is not the right one.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons are again two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something. Maybe a carbonyl group. Like -COCH3. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Wait, that makes sense. So benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring would have two sets of doublets. The methyl group as a singlet because it's attached to the carbonyl, which is deshielded. So the 2.3 ppm is for the COCH3 methyl. So this could be option C.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 singlet suggests a single proton, maybe an aromatic proton in a meta or para position. The 4.8 and 4.6 doublets suggest protons adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in an ether or ester linkage. The 1.3 is a singlet of 2H, perhaps a methylene group. Not sure how this fits with the aromatic ring and substituents.

So, going back, the initial analysis: the compound has a carbonyl and a halogen. So substituents are Cl and a carbonyl-containing group, perhaps -COCH3.

In that case, the structure would be para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, as in option C.

The NMR of option C shows 7.8 and 7.6, which are typical for a para-substituted benzene with strong electron-withdrawing groups. COCH3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho and para positions would be deshielded. So the aromatic protons would be at higher ppm.

Wait, but in the para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would affect the adjacent protons. So, for example, if Cl and COCH3 are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be at the ortho positions relative to each substituent.

Wait, wait, perhaps to better understand, let me imagine the structure. Structure: benzene ring with Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4 (para position). The other positions (2,3,5,6) would have H's. The substituents are para, so the ring would have two substituents opposite each other.

In that structure, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded because Cl is an electron-withdrawing group. The protons ortho to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. The para position to Cl is COCH3, so the H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, but in para substitution, each substituent affects the protons in a specific way. The ring would have two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H, as in option C.

So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, which matches option C. The singlet at 2.3 ppm is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So the correct NMR would be option C. Let me check the other options again.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9, which might be an aldehyde proton. But for an aldehyde, the ring would have substituents Cl and CHO. The NMR would have different patterns. Also, the 3.7 ppm singlet for 2H suggests another group, like OCH2O or something else, which doesn't fit with the substituents we have. So option A is probably not correct.

Option D has a singlet aromatic proton, which would suggest a substituent that's more complex, perhaps a meta-substituted ring. But since the substituents are di-substituted, but the NMR shows only one aromatic proton, that's unlikely. So D is probably not correct.

Option B doesn't have any aromatic protons, which can't be right because the compound is aromatic. So B is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (likely Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group. The total carbon count implies that the substituents must add 2 carbons to the benzene ring (6 carbons). A plausible substituent is a -COCH3 group, which contains 2 carbons (one in the carbonyl and one in the methyl group).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The NMR data includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton (-CHO). However, the aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the singlet at 3.7 ppm suggests another group, possibly OCH2. This does not align with the substituents (Cl and -COCH3) expected in the compound. **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B**: The NMR data shows peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm (doublets) and a singlet at 1.3 ppm. These signals suggest a structure with ethylene groups and a methyl group, but there are no aromatic protons, which contradicts the compound being aromatic. **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrates to 3H, likely corresponding to the methyl group of a -COCH3 substituent. This matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with Cl and -COCH3 as substituents. **Correct.**

4. **Option D**: The NMR data includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which suggests a single aromatic proton, inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. The peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm (doublets) and the singlet at 1.3 ppm (2H) suggest a structure with non-aromatic protons, which does not match the compound. **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data matches **Option C**, as it aligns with the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and -COCH3 as substituents. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the methyl group of the -COCH3 substituent appears as a singlet.
