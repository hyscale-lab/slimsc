Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think. First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if the question is about all operators, then if they must respect Poincare, they also respect Lorentz. But wait, in SMEFT, are the operators constructed to respect Poincare or Lorentz?

I think SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because all the operators are written as Lorentz-invariant terms. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected.

What about Poincare? Poincare includes translations. So do SMEFT operators have to be invariant under translations as well? Well, the effective theory is constructed in a way that is valid at low energies, but I think the Poincare symmetry isn't necessarily imposed because the effective theory can include nonrenormalizable terms, which might not be translationally invariant? Or wait, no, because Poincare includes spacetime translations, and for a theory to be Lorentz-invariant, it must also be Poincare-invariant if the fields are treated covariantly. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe it's the other way around: Poincare includes Lorentz, and any theory that's Poincare invariant is also Lorentz invariant, but the converse isn't necessarily true.

But in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, so they must be Lorentz-invariant. But do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry implies both Lorentz and translations. Wait, but the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so maybe it's not necessary to preserve Poincare? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Because in the Standard Model, which is a renormalizable theory, Poincare symmetry is definitely a thing. But in SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimension, but I think they still must respect Poincare because you can't have a Lorentz-invariant theory without Poincare symmetry. Or wait, no, because maybe the presence of a preferred frame (like in a non-inertial frame) could break Poincare, but in SMEFT, the way operators are written, they are Lorentz-invariant, which implies that the theory is also Poincare-invariant. So perhaps Poincare is automatically respected if Lorentz symmetry is.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes spacetime translations, which are not part of Lorentz. So perhaps SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect Poincare. Wait, but in reality, a Lorentz-invariant theory doesn't imply Poincare symmetry. For example, if you have a background gravitational field, which breaks translation symmetry.

Wait, but in SMEFT, we are working in a flat spacetime, right? Because SMEFT is an effective field theory valid in the absence of strong gravitational fields. So in that case, the theory should still respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if a theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant, it's Poincare-invariant. But if it's only Lorentz-invariant and not necessarily translation-invariant, then it doesn't have Poincare symmetry. But in flat spacetime, the SMEFT is constructed without any preferred points, so all points are equivalent, meaning translations are a symmetry.

Wait, but in any case, I think the SMEFT operators are written as Lorentz-invariant terms, but are they also Poincare-invariant? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetries of Minkowski space. So, for a theory to be a valid effective theory in Minkowski space, it should respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, for SMEFT operators, they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if all operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant, they must also be Poincare-invariant. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So, if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, that doesn't necessarily mean they're Poincare-invariant because they might not be translation-invariant. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in reality, any operator that's a Lorentz scalar is also a Poincare scalar? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. Or no. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. Suppose you have a term in the Lagrangian that's a Lorentz scalar. Does that ensure it's a Poincare scalar? I don't think so. Because Poincare includes more transformations. For example, a term that depends on the position (like x^μ) would not be translation-invariant, hence not Poincare-invariant, but it's a Lorentz scalar. So, in that case, the operator would respect Lorentz but not Poincare.

But in SMEFT, the operators are usually written in a way that doesn't depend on x^μ, right? Because they are supposed to be local operators, and the Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar. Oh, because the Lagrangian is a scalar, so it's translation-invariant. Because the action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime, and the theory is invariant under translations because the Lagrangian doesn't depend on x^μ.

So, in that case, the operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Because the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar. So that means for the operators in SMEFT, they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but the question is about operators, not the theory as a whole. Each operator must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz and Poincare-invariant theory, so all the operators in the theory must be built respecting these symmetries.

Wait, maybe the operators are Poincare-invariant because the theory is. So the answer would include both Lorentz and Poincare. So that would be option A) 1,2.

But then, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CP or CPT?

Wait, the Standard Model is symmetric under CPT, but not necessarily CP. For example, the Standard Model has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the Standard Model, CP is not a symmetry, but CPT is. So, in SMEFT, which is an effective theory of the SM, the operators must respect the SM's symmetries, which include CPT but not necessarily CP.

Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry, because that's part of the SM. But do they have to respect CP? No, because the SM doesn't require that. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry.

So looking back at the options: the question is which must be respected by all operators.

So 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare) must be respected. Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT operators are Lorentz-invariant, which implies Poincare symmetry. So, the correct answer would include 1 and 2.

Wait, but I thought that in the question, it's asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if all operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must also be Poincare-invariant. So, which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options: option A) is 1,2. Option C) is 1,2,4.

So, if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the correct set is 1,2, and 4. Because 4 is CPT symmetry.

Wait, wait. I also thought that CPT symmetry is a requirement because the Standard Model respects CPT.

So, must all operators in SMEFT respect CPT symmetry? Yes, because the SM, which is the underlying theory, must respect CPT. So any operator added must not violate CPT, as that would conflict with the SM's fundamental symmetries.

So, 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected. So which option includes these? Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must also be Poincare-invariant. So maybe 1 and 2 are both correct. But wait, the option C includes 1,2,4, which would be Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

But the initial options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The question is, which must all operators respect.

Wait, but do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, and the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar. Thus, the operators in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare.

So, in that case, 1,2, and 4 must be respected.

Wait, but the question lists 1 as Lorentz symmetry and 2 as Poincare. So the correct answer includes 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, what about option A being 1,2. If Poincare is included in 2, then yes, all operators must respect 1 and 2. But also, 4 (CPT) must be respected.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize:

- SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry: Yes.

- SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry: Yes, because the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar, meaning the operators must be built respecting Poincare.

- SMEFT operators must respect CP symmetry: No, because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry.

- SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry: Yes, because the SM respects CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the correct option is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an effective theory that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant terms. This is a fundamental requirement because the theory is formulated in a Lorentz-invariant framework. Therefore, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. Since SMEFT is formulated in Minkowski spacetime, where translations are a symmetry, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This is implied by the fact that the Lagrangian density is a Poincaré scalar.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM), which underpins SMEFT, does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in processes like electroweak interactions. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT symmetry would conflict with the underlying symmetries of the SM.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4

Wait, but the question is about operators, not the theory as a whole. Each operator must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz and Poincare-invariant theory, so all the operators in the theory must be built respecting these symmetries.

Wait, maybe the operators are Poincare-invariant because the theory is. So the answer would include both Lorentz and Poincare. So that would be option A) 1,2.

But then, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CP or CPT?

Wait, the Standard Model is symmetric under CPT, but not necessarily CP. For example, the Standard Model has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the Standard Model, CP is not a symmetry, but CPT is. So, in SMEFT, which is an effective theory of the SM, the operators must respect the SM's symmetries, which include CPT but not necessarily CP.

Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry, because that's part of the SM. But do they have to respect CP? No, because the SM doesn't require that. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry.

So looking back at the options: the question is which must be respected by all operators.

So 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare) must be respected. Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT operators are Lorentz-invariant, which implies Poincare symmetry. So, the correct answer would include 1 and 2.

Wait, but I thought that in the question, it's asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if all operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must also be Poincare-invariant. So, which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options: option A) is 1,2. Option C) is 1,2,4.

So, if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the correct set is 1,2, and 4. Because 4 is CPT symmetry.

Wait, wait. I also thought that CPT symmetry is a requirement because the Standard Model respects CPT.

So, must all operators in SMEFT respect CPT symmetry? Yes, because the SM, which is the underlying theory, must respect CPT. So any operator added must not violate CPT, as that would conflict with the SM's fundamental symmetries.

So, 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected. So which option includes these? Option C is 1,2,4.

But the initial options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The question is, which must all operators respect.

Wait, but do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, and the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar. Thus, the operators in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare.

So, in that case, 1,2, and 4 must be respected.

Wait, but the question lists 1 as Lorentz symmetry and 2 as Poincare. So the correct answer includes 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, what about option A being 1,2. If Poincare is included in 2, then yes, all operators must respect 1 and 2. But also, 4 (CPT) must be respected.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize:

- SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry: Yes.

- SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry: Yes, because the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar, meaning the operators must be built respecting Poincare.

- SMEFT operators must respect CP symmetry: No, because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT symmetry would conflict with the underlying symmetries of the SM.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required.
