Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions mixed together. Let me jot down the details.

First, the solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they'll react, right? I remember that when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So I need to find out if the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral overall.

Let me think about each component. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, probably, because they're strong. Then, the leftover H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, but mixing all three at once... Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see what's left after they neutralize each other.

Okay, let's compute the moles for each.

First, the volume and molarity for each solution.

CH3COOH: volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity = 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL = 0.4 L. 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of OH- = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait a second, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. So each mole gives 2 OH-.

Now, I think I need to consider the H+ and OH- from each solution.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the H+ from CH3COOH isn't much compared to the strong acid and base. But wait, after the strong acid and base react, maybe the CH3COOH will contribute some H+.

Wait, but maybe I should first neutralize the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

When H+ and OH- meet, they form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ available: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- available: 0.18 mol.

So, after the reaction, all H+ will be consumed, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

But wait, wait, that's not the end. Because the CH3COOH is still present. CH3COOH is an acid, so it can donate H+. The remaining OH- can react with CH3COOH.

So, the strong acid and base have reacted, leaving OH- which will now react with the acetic acid.

So the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 mol. And the moles of OH- left after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 mol.

So, when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, how much will be neutralized?

Each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of CH3COOH.

So, the OH- is 0.10 mol. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

So, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

Wait, no. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, and OH- is a strong base. So they'll react until one runs out.

In this case, OH- (0.10 mol) is more than CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH will react, leaving 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

After the HCl and Ba(OH)2 react, there's 0.10 mol OH- left. Then, we have 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So OH- will react with CH3COOH.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

So after this reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no. Because after the initial reaction (HCl and Ba(OH)2), the OH- is 0.10 mol. Then, all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH is neutralized, so the OH- decreases by 0.05 mol to 0.05 mol.

So now, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

But wait, I should also consider the total volume of the solution.

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH would be the negative log of that. Wait, but if the OH- concentration is 0.0416667 M, then pOH = -log(0.0416667).

Calculating that, log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2). Log(4.16667) is about 0.62, so log(4.16667e-2) is about 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH = 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. After reaction, H+ is 0, OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, this OH- will react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+. So the OH- reacts with CH3COOH as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. OH- is 0.10 mol.

So, OH- will neutralize 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

So total OH- is 0.05 mol in the solution.

Total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second—does the presence of CH3COO^- affect the solution? Because when CH3COOH reacts with OH-, it produces acetate ions, which are the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, the solution may have some buffering effect.

But in this case, the OH- is in excess after neutralizing all the CH3COOH. So the solution is dominated by the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 and the reaction with CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait—did I account for all the moles correctly?

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

H+ and OH- react: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.10 mol.

Then, CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with 0.05 mol OH-, producing 0.05 mol acetate and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So yes, total OH- is 0.05 mol. So the calculation seems correct.

So the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases in the mixture:

1. **Moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ from each solution:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     HCl dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂, forming water:  
     \[
     0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \to 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
     After this reaction, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) remains.

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
     CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so all \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) reacts, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

4. **Final concentration of OH⁻:**
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **pOH and pH:**
   - The pOH is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - The pH is then:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions mixed together. Let me jot down the details.

First, the solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they'll react, right? I remember that when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So I need to find out if the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral overall.

Let me think about each component. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, probably, because they're strong. Then, the leftover H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, but mixing all three at once... Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see what's left after they neutralize each other.

Okay, let's compute the moles for each.

First, the volume and molarity for each solution.

CH3COOH: volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity = 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL = 0.4 L. 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of OH- = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait a second, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. So each mole gives 2 OH-.

Now, I think I need to consider the H+ and OH- from each solution.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the H+ from CH3COOH isn't much compared to the strong acid and base. But wait, after the strong acid and base react, maybe the CH3COOH will contribute some H+.

Wait, but maybe I should first neutralize the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

When H+ and OH- meet, they form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ available: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- available: 0.18 mol.

So, after the reaction, all H+ will be consumed, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

But wait, wait, that's not the end. Because the CH3COOH is still present. CH3COOH is an acid, so it can donate H+. The remaining OH- can react with CH3COOH.

So, the strong acid and base have reacted, leaving OH- which will now react with the acetic acid.

So the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 mol. And the moles of OH- left after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 mol.

So, when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, how much will be neutralized?

Each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of CH3COOH.

So, the OH- is 0.10 mol. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

So, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

Wait, no. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, and OH- is a strong base. So they'll react until one runs out.

In this case, OH- (0.10 mol) is more than CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH will react, leaving 0.05 mol of OH-.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

After the HCl and Ba(OH)2 react, there's 0.10 mol OH- left. Then, we have 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So OH- will react with CH3COOH.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

So after this reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no. Because after the initial reaction (HCl and Ba(OH)2), the OH- is 0.10 mol. Then, all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH is neutralized, so the OH- decreases by 0.05 mol to 0.05 mol.

So now, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

But wait, I should also consider the total volume of the solution.

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH would be the negative log of that. Wait, but if the OH- concentration is 0.0416667 M, then pOH = -log(0.0416667).

Calculating that, log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2). Log(4.16667) is about 0.62, so log(4.16667e-2) is about 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH = 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. After reaction, H+ is 0, OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, this OH- will react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+. So the OH- reacts with CH3COOH as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. OH- is 0.10 mol.

So, OH- will neutralize 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

So total OH- is 0.05 mol in the solution.

Total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second—does the presence of CH3COO^- affect the solution? Because when CH3COOH reacts with OH-, it produces acetate ions, which are the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, the solution may have some buffering effect.

But in this case, the OH- is in excess after neutralizing all the CH3COOH. So the solution is dominated by the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 and the reaction with CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait—did I account for all the moles correctly?

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

H+ and OH- react: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.10 mol.

Then, CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with 0.05 mol OH-, producing 0.05 mol acetate and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So yes, total OH- is 0.05 mol. So the calculation seems correct.

So the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases in the mixture:

1. **Moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ from each solution:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     HCl dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂, forming water:  
     \[
     0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \to 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
     After this reaction, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) remains.

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
     CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so all \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) reacts, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

4. **Final concentration of OH⁻:**
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **pOH and pH:**
   - The pOH is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - The pH is then:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A
