Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame after 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame.

Wait, wait. So the problem involves relative motion between two inertial frames. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly because of the speed limits, but wait, the question says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So maybe it's a classical mechanics problem? Or is it using relativity?

Wait, the problem states both are inertial frames. So in Newtonian physics, that makes sense. Because inertial frames are non-accelerating. But the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's way higher than 0.1c. Because 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's see: 1 light-year is about 9.461e12 km, so 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 3.15e7 s/year = 1.89e13 km/year. Which is a lot, about 2 light-years per year. Wait, no, wait, 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 3.15e7 s/year = 1.89e13 km/year. Wait, 1 light-year is about 9.461e12 km, so 1.89e13 km is roughly 1.996 light-years per year. So 60,000 km/s is about 0.2c? Wait, speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times that, yes. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c.

But if the problem is considering classical mechanics, then velocity addition is straightforward. But if they're using relativity, then velocity addition is different. Wait, but in the question, the frames are inertial, so perhaps we're dealing with classical mechanics, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So time is not the same in both frames. Oh wait, no. Because in relativity, time dilation occurs, but for this problem, perhaps we can treat it as a simple velocity transformation. Let me think.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says both are inertial frames, so Galilean transformations are not valid when velocities are a significant fraction of c. So perhaps we should use special relativity.

Let me think about the setup. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let's define the frames. Let’s say in the Galaxy’s frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity -v (if v is the velocity of the ejecta in S).

But the problem states that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', v' = -60,000 km/s. Because in S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So what is the actual velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame? Well, using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c² )

Where u is the velocity of an object in frame S, and u' is the velocity in frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

So in this case, the Galaxy's center is moving at u = v in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no, let me get this straight.

Wait, actually, the Galaxy's center is at rest in its own frame. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -60,000 km/s (if we take the positive direction as away from the Galaxy's center). Now, in the ejecta's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s relative to S (Galaxy's frame), what is the velocity of the Galaxy's center?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's imagine that the Galaxy is at rest in frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (in S) at velocity u = -60,000 km/s.

In frame S' (the ejecta's frame), which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Wait, the relationship between S and S' is that S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So if the ejecta is moving at u in S, then in S', its velocity is u'.

Wait, no, let's get the correct setup. Let me take S as the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s? Or is it positive since it's moving towards the center?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me define the positive direction. Let’s say positive x-axis points away from the Galaxy's center. So in S (Galaxy’s frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity is u = -60,000 km/s. Now, the ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. So what is v?

Wait, no, because the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s in S. So S' is the rest frame of the ejecta. So the velocity of S' relative to S is u = -60,000 km/s. So v = -60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. If in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s, then S' is the ejecta's rest frame, so the velocity of S' relative to S is v = u = -60,000 km/s. So in S', the velocity of the Galaxy's center (which is at rest in S) would be u' = ?

Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

Wait, but in this case, the object in S is the Galaxy's center, which is at rest. So in S, the Galaxy's center's velocity is u = 0 (since it's in S). So u' is the velocity of the Galaxy's center in S'.

So substituting:

u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c² )

Which simplifies to u' = (-v) / 1 = -v.

But v is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving at v = -60,000 km/s relative to S (because the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s in S), then in S', the Galaxy's center would be moving at u' = -(-60,000 km/s) = +60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because u' is +60,000 km/s, which would mean the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (since the positive direction was defined away from the center).

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me recheck. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), so S' is moving at v = -60,000 km/s relative to S. So when I compute u' (the velocity of the Galaxy in S'), it's (0 - v) / (1 - 0 ) = (-v) = 60,000 km/s. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at +60,000 km/s. That matches the problem statement.

But wait, the question says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So that means the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So from the ejecta’s perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

But the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy’s frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta’s frame.

Wait, so the problem gives time in the ejecta’s frame (t’ =50 s), and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy’s frame (x in S when t = t’ * gamma or something? Or is it a simple transformation?)

Wait, so in the ejecta’s frame (S'), the time is t’ =50 s. But in the Galaxy’s frame (S), the time would be longer due to time dilation. So we can't just multiply speed by t’ to get the distance in S. Because in S, the time elapsed is t = gamma * t’ (since S' is moving relative to S). So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

So the process would be:

1. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

2. Then, find the distance the ejecta has traveled in that time, considering its speed in the Galaxy’s frame.

Wait, but the ejecta is moving at a speed v in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance would be x = v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, let me clarify the variables.

In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center). So the position of the ejecta as a function of time is x(t) = x0 + u * t. If we assume that at t=0, the ejecta is at x=0, so x(t) = u * t. But wait, no. Let's think about it. Suppose in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so at t=0, it's at some position, and then it moves towards x=0. But perhaps the problem is considering the distance traveled, so the movement is in the direction away from the center, but the ejecta is moving towards the center. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of relative motion and how the distance is measured.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it step by step.

First, the time in S is longer than in S' because the ejecta is moving at high speed relative to the Galaxy. So, the time experienced in S' (t') is 50 seconds. We need to find the corresponding time in S (t), then multiply by the speed of the ejecta in S (which is 60,000 km/s towards the center, so perhaps we take absolute value for distance).

But wait, how does the time in S relate to the time in S'? Time dilation in special relativity says that t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the relative velocity between the frames.

So first, calculate gamma.

v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s for calculation purposes. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v = 6e7 m/s.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

Compute v²: (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15.

c² is (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So v²/c² = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.4e-1 = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98.

So gamma is 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is this correct? Because the time in S would be longer than in S', so t should be higher. Gamma is about 1.02, so t is about 51 seconds.

But wait, is that correct? Let's compute gamma more accurately.

Compute v²/c² again: (6e7)^2/(3e8)^2 = (36e14)/(9e16) )= (36/900) )= 0.04. Wait, 36e14 is 3.6e15, divided by 9e16 is 0.04, yes. So 1 - 0.04 =0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798, since (0.98)^2 is 0.9604, which is very close. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.

So gamma = 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.02057.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.02057 *50 ≈51.0285 seconds.

So the time in S is approximately 51.03 seconds.

Then, the ejecta is moving at a speed of 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance traveled in S is speed * time.

Distance x = v * t, but since the ejecta is moving towards the center, the distance is 60,000 km/s * t.

Wait, but the time is 51.03 seconds. So let me compute that.

x = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 km.

Calculating that: 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. 60,000 *0.03=1,800 km. So total is 3,001,800 km. Wait, that's 3,001,800 km. Let me compute it more accurately.

But wait, 60,000 multiplied by 51.03 is:

60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km.

60,000 * 0.03 =1,800 km.

So 3,060,000 + 1,800 =3,061,800 km. So approximately 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (v²/c²) again.

v =6e4 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s.

v^2 = (6e7)^2 =36e14 m²/s².

c^2= (3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

v²/c²=36e14/9e16= (36/900)= 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04= 0.96.

sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma=1/0.979795897≈1.0205737.

t=gamma * t’=1.0205737 *50 ≈51.028685 seconds.

x=60,000 km/s *51.028685 s =60,000 *51.028685 km.

60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.028685= 60,000 *0.02=1,200; 60,000 *0.008685=517.5 km.

So 1,200 +517.5=1,717.5 km.

Total x≈3,060,000 +1,717.5=3,061,717.5 km.

So approximately 3,061,717 km. The options given are A) 2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.

Hmm, so our calculation is about 3,061,717 km, which is very close to option D) 3,060,000 km. So the answer is D.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the Galilean transformation instead, which ignores relativity. Let me think about that scenario.

If we treat the problem with classical mechanics, then the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (t') is the same as the time in the Galaxy's frame (t), because there's no time dilation. So t = t' =50 s.

Then, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But wait, in reality, at such high velocities, special relativity applies, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic calculation, leading to option D. But the presence of the options makes me think that perhaps the problem expects the classical approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us. Let's read the problem again.

The problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, in relativity, that's correct, but the velocities are high, so relativity is needed. But the given answer options suggest that the problem might be using classical mechanics, because 3,000,000 is an option, which would be the case in the Galilean approach.

Wait, but why is the time in the ejecta's frame being used to compute the distance in the Galaxy's frame? Because in the problem, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the duration is longer. So we can't just say distance = v * t' because t' is the ejecta's time, and we need to find the corresponding t in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.

So using the relativistic approach, the correct answer would be closer to 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

But the problem's options include B)3,000,000 km, which is the Galilean result. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the classical approach, but I'm confused because the problem gives a very high speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the relativistic velocity addition and the time transformation. So if you do it relativistically, you get option D, but if you do it classically, you get B.

Hmm, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so in relativity, that's correct, but they might want us to use the Galilean approach. Alternatively, the problem might be a trick, implying that the distance is v * t', ignoring the time dilation.

But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So that would require converting the 50 seconds to the Galaxy's frame time.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is t = gamma * t’ = 1.02057 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So the ejecta, moving at 60,000 km/s in that frame, would have traveled x =60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km, option D.

So the correct answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering the given frames of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame (S), and in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy appears to move towards the ejecta at the same speed. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   Since the relative velocity between the frames is 60,000 km/s (approximately 0.2c), relativistic effects must be considered. The time dilation factor, $\gamma$, is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(6 \times 10^7)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.02057
   \]  
   The time in the Galaxy's frame is related to the time in the ejecta's frame by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   Substituting $t' = 50 \, \text{s}$ and $\gamma \approx 1.02057$:  
   \[
   t \approx 1.02057 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The ejecta moves at a constant velocity of $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}$ in the Galaxy's frame. The distance traveled is given by:  
   \[
   x = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}$ and $t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}$:  
   \[
   x \approx 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately $3,060,000 \, \text{km}$, which matches option D.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2,940,000 km)** and **Option C (2,880,000 km)** are too low and inconsistent with the calculated distance.  
   - **Option B (3,000,000 km)** corresponds to the classical (non-relativistic) calculation, which ignores time dilation and is therefore incorrect for this high-velocity scenario.  
   - **Option D (3,060,000 km)** is the correct relativistic result, accounting for time dilation and the high velocity.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately $3,060,000 \, \text{km}$. This matches option D.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, that's way higher than 0.1c. Because 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's see: 1 light-year is about 9.461e12 km, so 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 3.15e7 s/year = 1.89e13 km/year. Which is a lot, about 2 light-years per year. Wait, no, wait, 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 3.15e7 s/year = 1.89e13 km/year. Wait, 1 light-year is about 9.461e12 km, so 1.89e13 km is roughly 1.996 light-years per year. So 60,000 km/s is about 0.2c? Wait, speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times that, yes. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c.

But if the problem is considering classical mechanics, then velocity addition is straightforward. But if they're using relativity, then velocity addition is different. Wait, but in the question, the frames are inertial, so perhaps we're dealing with classical mechanics, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So time is not the same in both frames. Oh wait, no. Because in relativity, time dilation occurs, but for this problem, perhaps we can treat it as a simple velocity transformation. Let me think.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says both are inertial frames, so Galilean transformations are not valid when velocities are a significant fraction of c. So perhaps we should use special relativity.

Let me think about the setup. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let's define the frames. Let’s say in the Galaxy’s frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity -v (if v is the velocity of the ejecta in S).

But the problem states that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', v' = -60,000 km/s. Because in S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So what is the actual velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame? Well, using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c² )

Where u is the velocity of an object in frame S, and u' is the velocity in frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

So in this case, the Galaxy's center is moving at u = v in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no, let me get this straight.

Wait, actually, the Galaxy's center is at rest in its own frame. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -60,000 km/s (if we take the positive direction as away from the Galaxy's center). Now, in the ejecta's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s relative to S (Galaxy's frame), what is the velocity of the Galaxy's center?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's imagine that the Galaxy is at rest in frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (in S) at velocity u = -60,000 km/s.

In frame S' (the ejecta's frame), which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Wait, the relationship between S and S' is that S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So if the ejecta is moving at u in S, then in S', its velocity is u'.

Wait, no, let's get the correct setup. Let me take S as the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s? Or is it positive since it's moving towards the center?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me define the positive direction. Let’s say positive x-axis points away from the Galaxy's center. So in S (Galaxy’s frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity is u = -60,000 km/s. Now, the ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. So what is v?

Wait, no, because the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s in S. So S' is the rest frame of the ejecta. So the velocity of S' relative to S is u = -60,000 km/s. So v = -60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. If in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s, then S' is the ejecta's rest frame, so the velocity of S' relative to S is v = u = -60,000 km/s. So in S', the velocity of the Galaxy's center (which is at rest in S) would be u' = ?

Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

Wait, but in this case, the object in S is the Galaxy's center, which is at rest. So in S, the Galaxy's center's velocity is u = 0 (since it's in S). So u' is the velocity of the Galaxy's center in S'.

So substituting:

u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c² )

Which simplifies to u' = (-v) / 1 = -v.

But v is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving at v = -60,000 km/s relative to S (because the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s in S), then in S', the Galaxy's center would be moving at u' = -(-60,000 km/s) = +60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because u' is +60,000 km/s, which would mean the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (since the positive direction was defined away from the center).

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me recheck. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), so S' is moving at v = -60,000 km/s relative to S. So when I compute u' (the velocity of the Galaxy in S'), it's (0 - v) / (1 - 0 ) = (-v) = 60,000 km/s. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at +60,000 km/s. That matches the problem statement.

But wait, the question says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So that means the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So from the ejecta’s perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

But the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy’s frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta’s frame.

Wait, so the problem gives time in the ejecta’s frame (t’ =50 s), and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy’s frame (x in S when t = t’ * gamma or something? Or is it a simple transformation?)

Wait, so in the ejecta’s frame (S'), the time is t’ =50 s. But in the Galaxy’s frame (S), the time would be longer due to time dilation. So we can't just multiply speed by t’ to get the distance in S. Because in S, the time elapsed is t = gamma * t’ (since S' is moving relative to S). So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

So the process would be:

1. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

2. Then, find the distance the ejecta has traveled in that time, considering its speed in the Galaxy’s frame.

Wait, but the ejecta is moving at a speed v in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance would be x = v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, let me clarify the variables.

In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center). So the position of the ejecta as a function of time is x(t) = x0 + u * t. If we assume that at t=0, the ejecta is at x=0, so x(t) = u * t. But wait, no. Let's think about it. Suppose in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so at t=0, it's at some position, and then it moves towards x=0. But perhaps the problem is considering the distance traveled, so the movement is in the direction away from the center, but the ejecta is moving towards the center. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of relative motion and how the distance is measured.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it step by step.

First, the time in S is longer than in S' because the ejecta is moving at high speed relative to the Galaxy. So, the time experienced in S' (t') is 50 seconds. We need to find the corresponding time in S (t), then multiply by the speed of the ejecta in S (which is 60,000 km/s towards the center, so perhaps we take absolute value for distance).

But wait, how does the time in S relate to the time in S'? Time dilation in special relativity says that t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the relative velocity between the frames.

So first, calculate gamma.

v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s for calculation purposes. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v = 6e7 m/s.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

Compute v²: (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15.

c² is (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So v²/c² = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.4e-1 = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98.

So gamma is 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is this correct? Because the time in S would be longer than in S', so t should be higher. Gamma is about 1.02, so t is about 51 seconds.

But wait, is that correct? Let's compute gamma more accurately.

Compute v²/c² again: (6e7)^2/(3e8)^2 = (36e14)/(9e16) )= (36/900) )= 0.04. Wait, 36e14 is 3.6e15, divided by 9e16 is 0.04, yes. So 1 - 0.04 =0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798, since (0.98)^2 is 0.9604, which is very close. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.

So gamma = 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.02057.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.02057 *50 ≈51.0285 seconds.

So the time in S is approximately 51.03 seconds.

Then, the ejecta is moving at a speed of 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance traveled in S is speed * time.

Distance x = v * t, but since the ejecta is moving towards the center, the distance is 60,000 km/s * t.

Wait, but the time is 51.03 seconds. So let me compute that.

x = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 km.

Calculating that: 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. 60,000 *0.03=1,800 km. So total is 3,001,800 km. Wait, that's 3,001,800 km. Let me compute it more accurately.

But wait, 60,000 multiplied by 51.03 is:

60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km.

60,000 * 0.03 =1,800 km.

So 3,060,000 + 1,800 =3,061,800 km. So approximately 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (v²/c²) again.

v =6e4 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s.

v^2 = (6e7)^2 =36e14 m²/s².

c^2= (3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

v²/c²=36e14/9e16= (36/900)= 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04= 0.96.

sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma=1/0.979795897≈1.0205737.

t=gamma * t’=1.0205737 *50 ≈51.028685 seconds.

x=60,000 km/s *51.028685 s =60,000 *51.028685 km.

60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.028685= 60,000 *0.02=1,200; 60,000 *0.008685=517.5 km.

So 1,200 +517.5=1,717.5 km.

Total x≈3,060,000 +1,717.5=3,061,717.5 km.

So approximately 3,061,717 km. The options given are A) 2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.

Hmm, so our calculation is about 3,061,717 km, which is very close to option D) 3,060,000 km. So the answer is D.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the Galilean transformation instead, which ignores relativity. Let me think about that scenario.

If we treat the problem with classical mechanics, then the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (t') is the same as the time in the Galaxy's frame (t), because there's no time dilation. So t = t' =50 s.

Then, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But wait, in reality, at such high velocities, special relativity applies, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic calculation, leading to option D. But the presence of the options makes me think that perhaps the problem expects the classical approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us. Let's read the problem again.

The problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, in relativity, that's correct, but the velocities are high, so relativity is needed. But the given answer options suggest that the problem might be using classical mechanics, because 3,000,000 is an option, which would be the case in the Galilean approach.

Wait, but why is the time in the ejecta's frame being used to compute the distance in the Galaxy's frame? Because in the problem, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the duration is longer. So we can't just say distance = v * t' because t' is the ejecta's time, and we need to find the corresponding t in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.

So using the relativistic approach, the correct answer would be closer to 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

But the problem's options include B)3,000,000 km, which is the Galilean result. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the classical approach, but I'm confused because the problem gives a very high speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the relativistic velocity addition and the time transformation. So if you do it relativistically, you get option D, but if you do it classically, you get B.

Hmm, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so in relativity, that's correct, but they might want us to use the Galilean approach. Alternatively, the problem might be a trick, implying that the distance is v * t', ignoring the time dilation.

But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So that would require converting the 50 seconds to the Galaxy's frame time.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is t = gamma * t’ = 1.02057 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So the ejecta, moving at 60,000 km/s in that frame, would have traveled x =60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km, option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering the given frames of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame (S), and in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy appears to move towards the ejecta at the same speed. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   Since the relative velocity between the frames is 60,000 km/s (approximately 0.2c), relativistic effects must be considered. The time dilation factor, $\gamma$, is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(6 \times 10^7)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.02057
   \]  
   The time in the Galaxy's frame is related to the time in the ejecta's frame by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   Substituting $t' = 50 \, \text{s}$ and $\gamma \approx 1.02057$:  
   \[
   t \approx 1.02057 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The ejecta moves at a constant velocity of $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}$ in the Galaxy's frame. The distance traveled is given by:  
   \[
   x = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting $v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}$ and $t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}$:  
   \[
   x \approx 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately $3,060,000 \, \text{km}$, which matches option D.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2,940,000 km)** and **Option C (2,880,000 km)** are too low and inconsistent with the calculated distance.  
   - **Option B (3,000,000 km)** corresponds to the classical (non-relativistic) calculation, which ignores time dilation and is therefore incorrect for this high-velocity scenario.  
   - **Option D (3,060,000 km)** is the correct relativistic result, accounting for time dilation and the high velocity.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately $3,060,000 \, \text{km}$. This matches option D.
