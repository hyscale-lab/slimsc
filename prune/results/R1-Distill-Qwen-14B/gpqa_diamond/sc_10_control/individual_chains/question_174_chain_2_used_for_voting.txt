Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Let's see.

The problem says the initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so initial mass M is 300 GeV/c², but after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99*M. Oh right, because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms.

So, let me think about the masses. Let me denote the smaller fragment's rest mass as m. Then the larger is 2m. So together, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99*M. So M=300 GeV/c², so 3m = 0.99 * 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV is the rest mass energy, so M = 300 GeV / c². So 3m = 0.99*300 GeV / c². So m = (0.99 *300) / (3 *3) ? Wait, no, 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3. 

Wait, M is 300 GeV/c², so m = (0.99 * 300 GeV/c²) /3 = (297 GeV/c²) /3 = 99 GeV/c². So the smaller fragment has 99 GeV/c², the larger has 198 GeV/c². Because 2 times 99 is 198. 

Wait, but the sum is 297 GeV/c², which is 99% of 300 GeV/c². So that's correct. 

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Since momentum p = gamma m v, but for each fragment, their velocities are in opposite directions. So the total momentum is zero. 

Wait, but how do we find their kinetic energies? Hmm. Let's think in terms of energy and momentum. The total energy after fission should equal the initial energy because energy is conserved. But wait, the initial energy is all rest mass energy, since it's at rest. So initial energy is 300 GeV.

After the split, each fragment has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy is sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. 

So, energy conservation: 

Total initial energy = total final energy.

300 GeV = (m c² + T1) + (2m c² + T2)

Wait, but wait. Wait, the rest mass energies are m c² and 2m c², respectively. So,

300 GeV = (m c² + T1) + (2m c² + T2)

But T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is 2m. So the other is m, so T2 is its kinetic energy.

But wait, the total rest mass is 3m = 297 GeV/c². So the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV. So the initial 300 GeV is split into rest mass energies and kinetic energies. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. 

Wait, because 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But since the system is symmetric in momentum, but the masses are different, their kinetic energies would be different. Hmm, okay. But how do I find T1 and T2?

I think I should set up equations for energy and momentum. Let me denote the velocities as v1 (for the more massive fragment) and v2 (for the lighter one). But since momentum is conserved, their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

gamma1 * (2m) * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2 

But the directions are opposite, so the signs would be opposite. So the magnitudes must be equal. So,

gamma1 * 2m * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the momentum vectors must cancel, the magnitudes must be equal.

So, |p1| = |p2|.

p1 = gamma1 * 2m * v1

p2 = gamma2 * m * v2

So,

gamma1 *2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2.

Divide both sides by m:

gamma1 * 2 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if v1 and v2 are related. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energies can be found from some other relation.

Wait, but considering that the kinetic energy is not simply (1/2)mv² in relativity, but (gamma-1) m c². So, T1 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c², T2 = (gamma2 -1) m c².

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where the two fragments are moving with velocities v and V (opposite directions), but their momenta are equal in magnitude. Let me think about relativistic momentum.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps I can calculate the relativistic T1, then compute the non-relativistic T1, then find their difference.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, what is T1?

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

But in the non-relativistic case, the conservation of energy and momentum would give:

Mv_initial = 0, so after fission, the two fragments have velocities v and V in opposite directions, such that:

m v = M_fragments * average velocity?

Wait, no. Momentum conservation: initial momentum is zero, so the momenta after must cancel.

So, for non-relativistic case,

m v = M v, but wait, no. Wait, the more massive fragment is 2m, the lighter is m.

Wait, in non-relativistic, momentum is conserved:

(2m) v1 = m v2.

Assuming opposite directions, perhaps v2 is negative.

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let's say fragment 1 (mass 2m) moves with velocity v, fragment 2 (mass m) moves with velocity u in the opposite direction, so u is negative.

So, 2m v = m u.

But u = -v' (if v' is positive in the opposite direction).

Wait, so 2m v = m (-v') => 2v = -v' => v' = -2v.

Hmm, so velocities are v and -2v.

Then, the kinetic energy in non-relativistic case is (1/2)(2m) v² + (1/2)m (2v)².

So,

T1 (non-rel) = (1/2)(2m) v² = m v².

T2 (non-rel) = (1/2)m (4v²) = 2 m v².

So sum T = 3 m v².

But from energy conservation:

Initial energy (M c²) equals sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, but in non-relativistic case, the rest energy is considered as m c², but in reality, that's not accurate. Wait, no, in the non-relativistic approximation, perhaps the kinetic energy is considered to be negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Wait, but in this case, the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy is small compared to that. Because after fission, sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300. So non-relativistic approx may be acceptable for the kinetic energies.

Wait, but the problem is that the problem says to compute T1 as the kinetic energy, and then find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation.

So let me compute T1 (relativistic) and T1 (non-rel), then subtract.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the non-relativistic calculation.

In non-relativistic:

Momentum conservation: 2m v = m u.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the larger fragment has mass 2m, so:

2m v1 = m v2. 

But since the directions are opposite, v2 is negative, so:

2m v1 = m (-v2) → v2 = -2 v1.

So, in terms of speed, the larger fragment is moving at v1, and the smaller at -2 v1.

Now, energy conservation:

The initial energy is all rest mass: 300 GeV.

The final energy is:

Rest energy of fragments: (2m c²) + (m c²) = 3m c² = 297 GeV.

Plus kinetic energies: T1 (2m) + T2 (m).

So,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.

So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic,

T1 = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

T2 = (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So,

T1 + T2 = 3 m v1² =3 GeV.

So,

3 m v1² =3 GeV → m v1² =1 GeV.

So,

T1 (non-rel) = m v1² =1 GeV.

Wait, that's 1 GeV. So approximately 1e9 eV, which is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but the options are in MeV, so that's way off. Wait, but the problem says the correct T1 is something, and the non-relativistic is another. Then the difference is one of the options (2,5,10,20 MeV). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, m is 99 GeV/c². Because earlier, m =99 GeV/c². So,

Wait, m v1^2 is 1 GeV.

So,

v1^2 = (1 GeV) / m.

But m is 99 GeV/c².

Wait, wait. Let me clarify units.

Wait, in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2. But m here is the rest mass. But in units where c=1, energy and mass are in same units, but when using SI units, you have to include factors of c².

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Let me try to be precise.

In the non-relativistic case:

Kinetic energy T = (1/2) m v^2.

Here, m is the rest mass, which is 99 GeV/c² for the smaller fragment, and 198 GeV/c² for the larger.

Wait, but in non-relativistic, the velocity v is in meters per second, so to get the right units, we have to consider T in GeV.

Wait, maybe I should use natural units, where c=1, so energy and mass are in same units.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think in terms of equations.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case:

Momentum conservation: 2m v1 = m v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But since they move in opposite directions, v2 = -2 v1.

Kinetic energies:

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

T2_nonrel = (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m (4 v1²) )= 2 m v1².

So sum T = 3 m v1² =3 GeV → m v1²=1 GeV.

So, T1_nonrel= m v1² =1 GeV =1000 MeV.

Wait, that's 1000 MeV, which is 1 GeV. But the options are in the MeV range. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², but m here is the rest mass, which is in GeV/c², and velocity is a fraction of c.

Wait, perhaps I need to include c in the expressions. Let me try again.

In non-relativistic:

T = (1/2) m v². But m is in GeV/c², and v is in terms of c.

So, let me write v as β c, where β is a fraction.

So,

T_nonrel = (1/2) m (β c)^2 = (1/2) m β² c².

But m c² is 99 GeV (for the smaller fragment).

So,

T_nonrel = (1/2) (99 GeV) β².

Similarly for the larger fragment: T1_nonrel = (1/2) (198 GeV) β1².

Wait, but earlier in momentum conservation, we found that v2 = 2 v1.

So, for the non-relativistic case, the velocities are related as v2=2 v1.

But when expressed in terms of β, v1=β1 c, v2=β2 c. So β2=2 β1.

So, using energy:

300 GeV = (2m c² + m c²) + T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel.

Which is,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel.

So,

T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel = 3 GeV.

Expressed in terms of β1:

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(198 GeV) β1².

T2_nonrel = (1/2)(99 GeV)( (2 β1)^2 ) = (1/2)(99 GeV)(4 β1²) = 198 GeV β1².

So,

(99 GeV β1²) + (198 GeV β1²) = 3 GeV.

Adding the terms: 297 GeV β1² =3 GeV → β1²=3/(297) → β1²=1/99 → β1=1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005.

So,

β1 ≈ 0.1.

So,

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(198 GeV)(β1^2) = 99 GeV (1/99) )= 1 GeV.

So again, T1_nonrel is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

But the options are in the MeV range. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not so good, but let's see.

Wait, but the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-rel) T1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct relativistic T1, then subtract the non-relativistic T1 of 1 GeV, and see which option matches.

So now, the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, we have to consider that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, for the larger fragment (mass 2m =198 GeV/c²):

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

Similarly, for the smaller fragment (mass m=99 GeV/c²):

T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV.

From energy conservation:

300 GeV = (198 +99) GeV + T1 + T2.

Which becomes:

300 = 297 + T1 + T2 → T1 + T2=3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1)*198 + (gamma2-1)*99 =3 GeV.

Additionally, from momentum conservation:

p1 = gamma1 * 198 * v1.

p2 = gamma2 *99 * v2.

And since momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 *198 v1 = gamma2 *99 v2.

But let's express velocities in terms of beta times c.

v1 = beta1 c, v2 = beta2 c.

So,

gamma1 *198 * beta1 c = gamma2 *99 * beta2 c.

Cancel c,

198 gamma1 beta1 = 99 gamma2 beta2.

Simplify:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But in the non-relativistic case, beta2=2 beta1. But in reality, with relativity, the velocities might not scale that way. So, this complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps I can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2, and beta1 and beta2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can find beta1 and beta2, then compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energy. Because 3 GeV is much smaller than 300 GeV. So, the velocities are not too close to c, so gamma is close to 1.

But wait, let's think. If the kinetic energy is around 3 GeV, which is about 1% of 300 GeV, so gamma is about 1.01 or so. So, perhaps a Taylor expansion can be used.

In that case, gamma ≈ 1 + (T)/(m c²).

So,

gamma1 ≈ 1 + (T1)/(198 GeV).

gamma2 ≈1 + (T2)/(99 GeV).

But T1 + T2 =3 GeV, and T1 = 3 - T2.

From momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But in terms of gamma and beta,

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

But perhaps it's better to express beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

But this might get messy.

Alternatively, since T1 and T2 are small, gamma -1 is small, so gamma ≈1 + (T/m c²).

So,

gamma1 ≈1 + T1/(198 GeV).

gamma2 ≈1 + T2/(99 GeV).

But,

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198.

Similarly,

T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99.

But since T1 + T2 =3,

( gamma1 -1 ) *198 + (gamma2 -1 ) *99 =3.

Let me substitute gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of T1 and T2.

But wait, this might not help. Let me try a substitution.

From the momentum equation,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 = v1/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)).

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

But since T is small, gamma1 and gamma2 are close to 1, so beta is approximately sqrt(2 (gamma -1)).

Wait, because when gamma is close to 1, (gamma -1) = (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

beta ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma -1) ) .

So,

beta1 ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma1 -1) ).

beta2 ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma2 -1 ) ).

So,

2 gamma1 * sqrt(2 (gamma1 -1)) ) = gamma2 * sqrt(2 (gamma2 -1)).

Simplify:

2 gamma1 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(gamma1 -1) ) = gamma2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(gamma2 -1).

Cancel sqrt(2) from both sides:

2 gamma1 sqrt(gamma1 -1 ) = gamma2 sqrt( gamma2 -1 )

But T1 = (gamma1 -1)198, T2= (gamma2 -1)99.

Let me denote x=gamma1-1, y=gamma2-1.

So, x = T1/(198), y= T2/(99).

So,

2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (1+y) sqrt(y).

We also have from energy, 198 x +99 y =3 GeV.

Which is,

2x + y = (3 GeV)/(99 GeV) )= 3/99 ≈ 0.0303.

Wait, 198x +99 y =3 GeV → 198x = 3 -99y → 2x= (3/(99)) - y → 2x = 0.0303 - y.

Wait, perhaps better to write:

198 x +99 y =3 → divide both sides by 99:

2x + y = 3/99 → 2x + y =1/33 ≈ 0.0303.

So,

We have two equations:

1) 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (1 + y) sqrt(y).

2) 2x + y = 1/33.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can make an approximate solution.

Assuming x and y are small, since the kinetic energy is small.

So, let's approximate sqrt(y) ≈ sqrt(0.0303 -2x).

Wait, but maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me assume that y= (1/33 -2x). So equation 2 gives y= (1/33) -2x.

Substitute into equation 1.

Equation1 becomes:

2 (1 +x) sqrt(x) = (1 + (1/33 -2x) ) sqrt( (1/33 -2x) )

Simplify the right-hand side:

1 + (1/33 -2x) ) = (1 +1/33) -2x = (34/33) -2x.

Sqrt of (1/33 -2x) is sqrt(y).

So,

2 (1 +x) sqrt(x) = (34/33 -2x) sqrt( (1/33 -2x) )

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can neglect 2x compared to 34/33.

Wait, 34/33 is about 1.03, so 34/33 -2x ≈ 1.03 - 2x.

But perhaps x is small, like a small fraction.

Let me make an initial guess.

Assume that x is much smaller than 1, so 1+x ≈1.

Similarly, 34/33 -2x ≈ 34/33.

So,

Left side: 2 *1 * sqrt(x) = 2 sqrt(x).

Right side: (34/33) * sqrt( 1/33 ) ) → since 1/33 -2x ≈1/33.

So,

2 sqrt(x) = (34/33) * sqrt(1/33).

Compute (34/33) * sqrt(1/33):

34/(33) = ~1.03.

sqrt(1/33) = 1/sqrt(33) ≈0.174.

So,

1.03 *0.174 ≈0.179.

So,

2 sqrt(x) =0.179 → sqrt(x) ≈0.0895 → x≈0.00799.

So, x≈0.00799.

Then, y=1/33 - 2x = 0.0303 - 2*(0.00799) = 0.0303 -0.01598 ≈0.0143.

So,

x=0.00799 → T1 =198 x ≈198 *0.00799 ≈1.58 GeV.

y=0.0143 → T2=99 *0.0143 ≈1.416 GeV.

Sum T1 +T2 = 1.58 +1.416≈3.0 MeV? Wait, no, 1.58+1.416=2.996 GeV, which is ~3 GeV. Correct.

Now, let's plug these back into the momentum equation to see if the approximation holds.

So, compute 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) and (34/33 -2x) sqrt(1/33 -2x).

With x=0.00799,

1+x=1.00799.

sqrt(x)=sqrt(0.00799)=≈0.0894.

So,

2 *1.00799 *0.0894 ≈2 *1.008 *0.0894 ≈ 0.181.

On the right side,

34/33 -2x =1.0303-0.01598≈1.0143.

sqrt(1/33 -2x)=sqrt(0.0303 -0.01598)=sqrt(0.0143)=≈0.1196.

So,

1.0143 *0.1196 ≈0.1213.

Wait, but the left is ~0.181, right is ~0.1213. They're not equal, so the initial approximation isn't sufficient.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that a better approximation is needed.

Let me adjust x and y.

Let me try a better approximation.

We have,

Equation 1: 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (34/33 -2x) sqrt( (1/33) -2x )

Equation 2: 2x + y = 1/33, y=1/33 -2x.

We can try to solve these numerically.

Let me set up an iterative approach.

Let me assume initial x=0.008, y=0.0303 -2*0.008=0.0303-0.016=0.0143.

Compute left side: 2*(1.008)*sqrt(0.008)= 2*1.008 *0.0894≈ 0.181.

Right side: (34/33 -0.016) * sqrt(0.0303-0.016). 

34/33=1.0303, 1.0303-0.016=1.0143.

0.0303-0.016=0.0143.

sqrt(0.0143)=0.1196.

So right side=1.0143 *0.1196≈0.1212.

So left=0.181, right=0.1212. Need to increase right.

Since right is smaller than left, perhaps we need to increase x, which would lower y, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to increase x to make the left side larger, but let's see.

Wait, let me consider that the left side increases as x increases, because sqrt(x) increases. The right side, though, depends on both terms: (34/33 -2x) and sqrt( ... ), which decrease as x increases.

So perhaps increasing x will increase left side, but decrease right side. So perhaps it's better to lower x.

Wait, but in the first iteration, x=0.008, left=0.181, right=0.1212. So left is larger. So perhaps we need to lower x.

Let me try x=0.006.

Then, y=1/33 -2*0.006=0.0303-0.012=0.0183.

Left side:2*(1.006)*sqrt(0.006)=2*(1.006)*0.0775 ≈ 2 *1.006 *0.0775 ≈ 0.156.

Right side: (34/33 -0.012)=1.0303 -0.012=1.0183.

sqrt(0.0303 -0.012)=sqrt(0.0183)=≈0.1353.

So, right=1.0183 *0.1353≈0.1375.

Now, left=0.156, right=0.1375. Still left>right. So need to increase right.

We need to make right bigger. How? Since right is (34/33 -2x) * sqrt(1/33 -2x), which is a function that increases when x is small but decreases when x increases beyond a point.

Wait, perhaps taking x=0.007.

x=0.007 → y=0.0303 - 0.014=0.0163.

Left: 2*(1.007)*sqrt(0.007)=2*1.007 *0.0837 ≈2 *1.007 *0.0837≈0.170.

Right: (34/33 -0.014)=1.0303-0.014=1.0163.

sqrt(0.0303-0.014)=sqrt(0.0163)=≈0.1277.

Right=1.0163 *0.1277≈0.1299.

Left=0.170>right=0.1299. Still not matching.

Hmm. Let's try x=0.005.

y=0.0303-0.01=0.0203.

Left:2*(1.005)*sqrt(0.005)=2 *1.005 *0.0707≈2 *1.005 *0.0707≈0.142.

Right: (34/33 -0.01)=1.0303-0.01=1.0203.

sqrt(0.0303 -0.01)=sqrt(0.0203)=≈0.1424.

Right=1.0203 *0.1424≈0.1456.

Now, left≈0.142, right≈0.1456. Close, but left<right.

So, now, we have left < right.

We need to find x where 2(1+x)sqrt(x)= (34/33-2x) sqrt(1/33-2x).

At x=0.005, left=0.142 < right=0.1456.

At x=0.006, left=0.156> right=0.1375.

Wait, no, earlier at x=0.006, right was 0.1375, which was less than left (0.156).

Wait, perhaps better to plot or use a better method, but perhaps I can use linear approximation.

Let me consider x around 0.005 and 0.006.

At x=0.005: left=0.142, right=0.1456.

At x=0.006: left=0.156, right=0.1375.

We need to find x where left equals right.

The function f(x)= left - right.

At x=0.005: f=0.142-0.1456= -0.0036.

At x=0.006: f=0.156-0.1375= +0.0185.

We need to find x where f(x)=0.

Assuming linear variation between x=0.005 and 0.006.

The change in x is 0.001.

Change in f is from -0.0036 to +0.0185: total change 0.0221.

We need to find when f=0.

So, from x=0.005, we need to go (0.0036)/(0.0221) fraction of 0.001.

Fraction= 0.0036 /0.0221≈0.163.

So, x=0.005 +0.163*(0.001)≈0.005163.

So x≈0.005163.

So, x≈0.00516.

Then,

y=1/33 -2x =0.0303 - 2*(0.00516 )=0.0303 -0.01032=0.02.

So, x=0.00516 → T1=198 * x= 198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

y=0.02 → T2=99 *0.02=1.98 GeV.

Check: T1 +T2=1.016+1.98=3 GeV. Correct.

Now, compute left and right with x=0.00516.

Left: 2*(1+0.00516)*sqrt(0.00516).

Compute:

1+0.00516=1.00516.

sqrt(0.00516)=≈0.0718.

So,

2 *1.00516 *0.0718 ≈2 *1.00516 *0.0718 ≈0.144.

Right: (34/33 -2*0.00516) * sqrt(1/33 -2*0.00516).

Compute 34/33≈1.0303.

2*0.00516=0.01032.

So,

34/33 -0.01032=1.0303 -0.01032=1.02.

And,

1/33 -0.01032≈0.0303 -0.01032=0.02.

sqrt(0.02)=≈0.1414.

So,

Right=1.02 *0.1414≈0.1442.

Left=0.144, right≈0.1442. Close enough.

So, x≈0.00516.

Thus, T1=198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

So, the relativistic T1 is approximately 1.016 GeV, which is 1016 MeV.

Wait, but the non-relativistic T1 was 1 GeV, so the difference is about 1.6 MeV.

But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my approximation is not accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact relativistic equations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that in the center of momentum frame, the velocities are related by their masses.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that the kinetic energy is small, so velocities are low, and use a binomial expansion for gamma.

Gamma = 1 + (1/2) v²/c² + (3/8) v^4/c^4 + ...

But since v^2/c² is small, we can approximate gamma as 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, for the larger fragment (mass 2m):

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *2m c² ≈ (v1²/(2 c²)) *2m c² = m v1².

Similarly, for the smaller fragment:

T2≈ m v2².

Wait, but this seems to bring us back to the non-relativistic case, which can't be right because in reality, the relativistic case gives a higher T1 than the non-relativistic.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the relativistic T1 was about 1.016 GeV, and non-relativistic was 1 GeV, so the difference is about 0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

Which is close to option B (5 MeV) or C (10 MeV). Hmm, but 16 is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exact difference.

Wait, the correct T1 is approximately 1.016 GeV, and the non-rel T1 is 1 GeV. So the difference would be 0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

But the options don't have 16 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, but in the non-rel case, the sum is also 3 GeV. So the difference would be (rel T1) - (non-rel T1) = (1.016 GeV -1 GeV) =0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me check the earlier assumption that T1 is 198 x.

Wait, in the relativistic case, T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

In the approximation method, we found x=gamma1 -1=0.00516, so T1=198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

The non-rel T1 is (using the non-rel calculation) 1 GeV.

So the difference is 0.016 GeV =16 MeV.

But this isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Is there another approach? Perhaps using the fact that the kinetic energy is small and using a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact relativistic T1.

Let me consider the exact equations.

We have:

p1 = gamma1 * 198 * v1.

p2 = gamma2 *99 * v2.

And p1 = - p2.

So,

gamma1 *198 v1 = gamma2 *99 v2.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Now, v = beta c.

So,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

We can write beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma2²).

We also have,

T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

T1=(gamma1 -1)*198, T2=(gamma2 -1)*99.

So,

198(gamma1 -1) +99(gamma2 -1) =3.

Divide both sides by 99:

2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 = 1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 1/33 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1/33 +3 = 3 + 0.0303 ≈3.0303.

Wait, no:

Wait, 2(gamma1-1) + (gamma2 -1) =1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 =1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 +1/33 ≈3.0303.

Wait, that's 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Hmm, let's denote equation 3: 2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303.

And equation 4: 2 gamma1 sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1-1/gamma2²).

This is a system of two equations with two variables, gamma1 and gamma2.

This might be tricky to solve, but perhaps we can make an assumption that gamma2 is approximately twice gamma1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express gamma2 from equation 3 and substitute into equation 4.

From equation3,

gamma2=3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation4:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) = (3.0303 -2 gamma1) sqrt(1 -1/( (3.0303 -2 gamma1)^2 )).

This equation is complex, but perhaps we can assume gamma1 is close to 1 since the kinetic energy is small.

Let me assume gamma1=1 + a, where a is small.

Similarly, gamma2=3.0303 -2(1 +a)= 3.0303 -2 -2a=1.0303 -2a.

Since a is small, gamma2 is approximately 1.03, which is reasonable.

Now, let's express sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) in terms of a.

gamma1=1+a → 1/gamma1²≈1 - 2a + 3a².

So,

sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = sqrt( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² )=sqrt( (2a + ... ) / (1+2a)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2a) [using approximation for small a].

Similarly, sqrt(1-1/gamma2² )=sqrt( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2² )= sqrt( (gamma2-1)(gamma2+1) )/gamma2.

gamma2=1.0303 -2a → gamma2-1=0.0303 -2a.

gamma2+1=2.0303 -2a.

But since a is small, gamma2+1≈2.03.

So,

sqrt( (0.0303 -2a) *2.03 ) / (1.0303 -2a) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.0303)(2.03) ) / (1.03) → sqrt(0.0614) /1.03 ≈0.248 /1.03≈0.240.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

But perhaps this approach isn't the best. Maybe I can use another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that gamma2 is approximately twice gamma1, but given that the larger fragment is twice as massive, that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try a trial and error approach.

Let me try gamma1=1.005.

Then,

gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.005=3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

Now,

Left side: 2 *1.005 * sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2).

1.005^2=1.010025 → 1/1.010025≈0.9901.

So, 1-0.9901=0.0099.

sqrt(0.0099)=0.0995.

So,

2 *1.005 *0.0995≈2 *1.005 *0.0995≈0.199.

Right side: gamma2 * sqrt(1-1/gamma2²).

gamma2=1.0203.

gamma2^2=1.0412.

1/gamma2^2≈0.9609.

1-0.9609=0.0391.

sqrt(0.0391)=0.1977.

So,

Right=1.0203 *0.1977≈0.201.

Left≈0.199, right≈0.201. Close enough.

So, gamma1=1.005, gamma2≈1.0203.

Thus,

T1= (gamma1 -1)*198 =0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

T2= (gamma2-1)*99 =0.0203 *99≈2.0097 GeV.

Sum: 0.99 +2.0097≈3.0 GeV. Correct.

So, T1=0.99 GeV.

In non-relativistic, T1 was 1 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.99 GeV -1 GeV= -0.01 GeV= -10 MeV.

Wait, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-rel) T1.

So, correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, non-rel is 1 GeV.

Difference is 0.99-1= -0.01 GeV= -10 MeV. Absolute difference is 10 MeV.

But the options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

So, the answer would be C)10 MeV.

But wait, earlier when I used the approximation with x=0.00516, I got T1=1.016 GeV, but with this trial and error approach, I got T1=0.99 GeV.

Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Because in the trial and error, I found gamma1=1.005, which would imply x=gamma1-1=0.005.

So, T1=198 *0.005=0.99 GeV.

But earlier, when I tried the x=0.005, the left and right were close but not matching, so perhaps the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV.

So, the difference between correct (0.99 GeV) and non-rel (1.0 GeV) is 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

So the answer is C)10 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approximations to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of **300 GeV**.
- After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:
  - Fragment 1 (more massive): Rest mass = **198 GeV/c²**.
  - Fragment 2 (less massive): Rest mass = **99 GeV/c²**.
- The total rest mass of the fragments is **99%** of the initial mass, i.e., **297 GeV/c²**.
- The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is **3 GeV** (since the initial energy is 300 GeV, and the rest energy is 297 GeV).

### Key Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   300 \, \text{GeV} = (198 + 99) \, \text{GeV} + T_1 + T_2
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero:
   \[
   p_1 = p_2,
   \]
   where \( p_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 \) and \( p_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \). For the fragments, this implies:
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of each fragment is given by:
   \[
   T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2, \quad T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2.
   \]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
\]
Using momentum conservation:
\[
2 m v_1 = m v_2 \implies v_2 = 2 v_1.
\]
The kinetic energies are:
\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v_1^2 = m v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m (2v_1)^2 = 4 m v_1^2.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 m v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
For Fragment 1:
\[
T_1 = m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is:
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2, \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Using \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and solving for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203.
\]
The kinetic energies are:
\[
T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2 = (1.005 - 1) \cdot 198 \, \text{GeV} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV},
\]
\[
T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2 = (1.0203 - 1) \cdot 99 \, \text{GeV} \approx 2.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
The total kinetic energy is:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} + 2.01 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \), and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = |T_{1, \text{rel}} - T_{1, \text{non-rel}}| = |0.99 - 1| \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Let's see.

The problem says the initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so initial mass M is 300 GeV/c², but after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99*M. Oh right, because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms.

So, let me think about the masses. Let me denote the smaller fragment's rest mass as m. Then the larger is 2m. So together, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99*M. So M=300 GeV/c², so 3m = 0.99 * 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV is the rest mass energy, so M = 300 GeV / c². So 3m = 0.99*300 GeV / c². So m = (0.99 *300) / (3 *3) ? Wait, no, 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3. 

Wait, M is 300 GeV/c², so m = (0.99 * 300 GeV/c²) /3 = (297 GeV/c²) /3 = 99 GeV/c². So the smaller fragment has 99 GeV/c², the larger has 198 GeV/c². Because 2 times 99 is 198. 

Wait, but the sum is 297 GeV/c², which is 99% of 300 GeV/c². So that's correct. 

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Since momentum p = gamma m v, but for each fragment, their velocities are in opposite directions. So the total momentum is zero. 

Wait, but how do we find their kinetic energies? Hmm. Let's think in terms of energy and momentum. The total energy after fission should equal the initial energy because energy is conserved. But wait, the initial energy is all rest mass energy, since it's at rest. So initial energy is 300 GeV.

After the split, each fragment has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy is sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. 

So, energy conservation: 

Total initial energy = total final energy.

300 GeV = (m c² + T1) + (2m c² + T2)

Wait, but wait. Wait, the rest mass energies are m c² and 2m c², respectively. So,

300 GeV = (m c² + T1) + (2m c² + T2)

But T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is 2m. So the other is m, so T2 is its kinetic energy.

But wait, the total rest mass is 3m = 297 GeV/c². So the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV. So the initial 300 GeV is split into rest mass energies and kinetic energies. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. 

Wait, because 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But since the system is symmetric in momentum, but the masses are different, their kinetic energies would be different. Hmm, okay. But how do I find T1 and T2?

I think I should set up equations for energy and momentum. Let me denote the velocities as v1 (for the more massive fragment) and v2 (for the lighter one). But since momentum is conserved, their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

gamma1 * (2m) * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2 

But the directions are opposite, so the signs would be opposite. So the magnitudes must be equal. So,

gamma1 * 2m * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the momentum vectors must cancel, the magnitudes must be equal.

So, |p1| = |p2|.

p1 = gamma1 * 2m * v1

p2 = gamma2 * m * v2

So,

gamma1 *2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2.

Divide both sides by m:

gamma1 * 2 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if v1 and v2 are related. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energies can be found from some other relation.

Wait, but considering that the kinetic energy is not simply (1/2)mv² in relativity, but (gamma-1) m c². So, T1 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c², T2 = (gamma2 -1) m c².

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where the two fragments are moving with velocities v and V (opposite directions), but their momenta are equal in magnitude. Let me think about relativistic momentum.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps I can calculate the relativistic T1, then compute the non-relativistic T1, then find their difference.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, what is T1?

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

But in the non-relativistic case, the conservation of energy and momentum would give:

Mv_initial = 0, so after fission, the two fragments have velocities v and V in opposite directions, such that:

m v = M_fragments * average velocity?

Wait, no. Momentum conservation: initial momentum is zero, so the momenta after must cancel.

So, for non-relativistic case,

m v = M v, but wait, no. Wait, the more massive fragment is 2m, the lighter is m.

Wait, in non-relativistic, momentum is conserved:

(2m) v1 = m v2.

Assuming opposite directions, perhaps v2 is negative.

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let's say fragment 1 (mass 2m) moves with velocity v, fragment 2 (mass m) moves with velocity u in the opposite direction, so u is negative.

So, 2m v = m u.

But u = -v' (if v' is positive in the opposite direction).

Wait, so 2m v = m (-v') => 2v = -v' => v' = -2v.

Hmm, so velocities are v and -2v.

Then, the kinetic energy in non-relativistic case is (1/2)(2m) v² + (1/2)m (2v)².

So,

T1 (non-rel) = (1/2)(2m) v² = m v².

T2 (non-rel) = (1/2)m (4v²) = 2 m v².

So sum T = 3 m v².

But from energy conservation:

Initial energy (M c²) equals sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, but in non-relativistic case, the rest energy is considered as m c², but in reality, that's not accurate. Wait, no, in the non-relativistic approximation, perhaps the kinetic energy is considered to be negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Wait, but in this case, the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy is small compared to that. Because after fission, sum of rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300. So non-relativistic approx may be acceptable for the kinetic energies.

Wait, but the problem is that the problem says to compute T1 as the kinetic energy, and then find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation.

So let me compute T1 (relativistic) and T1 (non-rel), then subtract.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the non-relativistic calculation.

In non-relativistic:

Momentum conservation: 2m v = m u.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the larger fragment has mass 2m, so:

2m v1 = m v2. 

But since the directions are opposite, v2 is negative, so:

2m v1 = m (-v2) → v2 = -2 v1.

So, in terms of speed, the larger fragment is moving at v1, and the smaller at -2 v1.

Now, energy conservation:

The initial energy is all rest mass: 300 GeV.

The final energy is:

Rest energy of fragments: (2m c²) + (m c²) = 3m c² = 297 GeV.

Plus kinetic energies: T1 (2m) + T2 (m).

So,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2.

So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic,

T1 = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

T2 = (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So,

T1 + T2 = 3 m v1² =3 GeV.

So,

3 m v1² =3 GeV → m v1² =1 GeV.

So,

T1 (non-rel) = m v1² =1 GeV.

Wait, that's 1 GeV. So approximately 1e9 eV, which is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but the options are in MeV, so that's way off. Wait, but the problem says the correct T1 is something, and the non-relativistic is another. Then the difference is one of the options (2,5,10,20 MeV). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, m is 99 GeV/c². Because earlier, m =99 GeV/c². So,

Wait, m v1^2 is 1 GeV.

So,

v1^2 = (1 GeV) / m.

But m is 99 GeV/c².

Wait, wait. Let me clarify units.

Wait, in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2. But m here is the rest mass. But in units where c=1, energy and mass are in same units, but when using SI units, you have to include factors of c².

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Let me try to be precise.

In the non-relativistic case:

Kinetic energy T = (1/2) m v^2.

Here, m is the rest mass, which is 99 GeV/c² for the smaller fragment, and 198 GeV/c² for the larger.

Wait, but in non-relativistic, the velocity v is in meters per second, so to get the right units, we have to consider T in GeV.

Wait, maybe I should use natural units, where c=1, so energy and mass are in same units.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think in terms of equations.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case:

Momentum conservation: 2m v1 = m v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But since they move in opposite directions, v2 = -2 v1.

Kinetic energies:

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

T2_nonrel = (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m (4 v1²) )= 2 m v1².

So sum T = 3 m v1² =3 GeV → m v1²=1 GeV.

So, T1_nonrel= m v1² =1 GeV =1000 MeV.

Wait, that's 1000 MeV, which is 1 GeV. But the options are in the MeV range. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², but m here is the rest mass, which is in GeV/c², and velocity is a fraction of c.

Wait, perhaps I need to include c in the expressions. Let me try again.

In non-relativistic:

T = (1/2) m v². But m is in GeV/c², and v is in terms of c.

So, let me write v as β c, where β is a fraction.

So,

T_nonrel = (1/2) m (β c)^2 = (1/2) m β² c².

But m c² is 99 GeV (for the smaller fragment).

So,

T_nonrel = (1/2) (99 GeV) β².

Similarly for the larger fragment: T1_nonrel = (1/2) (198 GeV) β1².

Wait, but earlier in momentum conservation, we found that v2 = 2 v1.

So, for the non-relativistic case, the velocities are related as v2=2 v1.

But when expressed in terms of β, v1=β1 c, v2=β2 c. So β2=2 β1.

So, using energy:

300 GeV = (2m c² + m c²) + T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel.

Which is,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel.

So,

T1_nonrel + T2_nonrel = 3 GeV.

Expressed in terms of β1:

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(198 GeV) β1².

T2_nonrel = (1/2)(99 GeV)( (2 β1)^2 ) = (1/2)(99 GeV)(4 β1²) = 198 GeV β1².

So,

(99 GeV β1²) + (198 GeV β1²) = 3 GeV.

Adding the terms: 297 GeV β1² =3 GeV → β1²=3/(297) → β1²=1/99 → β1=1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005.

So,

β1 ≈ 0.1.

So,

T1_nonrel = (1/2)(198 GeV)(β1^2) = 99 GeV (1/99) )= 1 GeV.

So again, T1_nonrel is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

But the options are in the MeV range. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not so good, but let's see.

Wait, but the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-rel) T1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct relativistic T1, then subtract the non-relativistic T1 of 1 GeV, and see which option matches.

So now, the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, we have to consider that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, for the larger fragment (mass 2m =198 GeV/c²):

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

Similarly, for the smaller fragment (mass m=99 GeV/c²):

T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV.

From energy conservation:

300 GeV = (198 +99) GeV + T1 + T2.

Which becomes:

300 = 297 + T1 + T2 → T1 + T2=3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1)*198 + (gamma2-1)*99 =3 GeV.

Additionally, from momentum conservation:

p1 = gamma1 * 198 * v1.

p2 = gamma2 *99 * v2.

And since momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 *198 v1 = gamma2 *99 v2.

But let's express velocities in terms of beta times c.

v1 = beta1 c, v2 = beta2 c.

So,

gamma1 *198 * beta1 c = gamma2 *99 * beta2 c.

Cancel c,

198 gamma1 beta1 = 99 gamma2 beta2.

Simplify:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But in the non-relativistic case, beta2=2 beta1. But in reality, with relativity, the velocities might not scale that way. So, this complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps I can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2, and beta1 and beta2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can find beta1 and beta2, then compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energy. Because 3 GeV is much smaller than 300 GeV. So, the velocities are not too close to c, so gamma is close to 1.

But wait, let's think. If the kinetic energy is around 3 GeV, which is about 1% of 300 GeV, so gamma is about 1.01 or so. So, perhaps a Taylor expansion can be used.

In that case, gamma ≈ 1 + (T)/(m c²).

So,

gamma1 ≈ 1 + (T1)/(198 GeV).

gamma2 ≈1 + (T2)/(99 GeV).

But T1 + T2 =3 GeV, and T1 = 3 - T2.

From momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But in terms of gamma and beta,

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

But perhaps it's better to express beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

But this might get messy.

Alternatively, since T1 and T2 are small, gamma -1 is small, so gamma ≈1 + (T/m c²).

So,

gamma1 ≈1 + T1/(198 GeV).

gamma2 ≈1 + T2/(99 GeV).

But,

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198.

Similarly,

T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99.

But since T1 + T2 =3,

( gamma1 -1 ) *198 + (gamma2 -1 ) *99 =3.

Let me substitute gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of T1 and T2.

But wait, this might not help. Let me try a substitution.

From the momentum equation,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 = v1/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)).

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

But since T is small, gamma1 and gamma2 are close to 1, so beta is approximately sqrt(2 (gamma -1)).

Wait, because when gamma is close to 1, (gamma -1) = (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

beta ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma -1) ) .

So,

beta1 ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma1 -1) ).

beta2 ≈ sqrt( 2 (gamma2 -1 ) ).

So,

2 gamma1 * sqrt(2 (gamma1 -1)) ) = gamma2 * sqrt(2 (gamma2 -1)).

Simplify:

2 gamma1 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(gamma1 -1) ) = gamma2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(gamma2 -1).

Cancel sqrt(2) from both sides:

2 gamma1 sqrt(gamma1 -1 ) = gamma2 sqrt( gamma2 -1 )

But T1 = (gamma1 -1)198, T2= (gamma2 -1)99.

Let me denote x=gamma1-1, y=gamma2-1.

So, x = T1/(198), y= T2/(99).

So,

2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (1+y) sqrt(y).

We also have from energy, 198 x +99 y =3 GeV.

Which is,

2x + y = (3 GeV)/(99 GeV) )= 3/99 ≈ 0.0303.

Wait, 198x +99 y =3 GeV → 198x = 3 -99y → 2x= (3/(99)) - y → 2x = 0.0303 - y.

Wait, perhaps better to write:

198 x +99 y =3 → divide both sides by 99:

2x + y = 3/99 → 2x + y =1/33 ≈ 0.0303.

So,

We have two equations:

1) 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (1 + y) sqrt(y).

2) 2x + y = 1/33.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can make an approximate solution.

Assuming x and y are small, since the kinetic energy is small.

So, let's approximate sqrt(y) ≈ sqrt(0.0303 -2x).

Wait, but maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me assume that y= (1/33 -2x). So equation 2 gives y= (1/33) -2x.

Substitute into equation 1.

Equation1 becomes:

2 (1 +x) sqrt(x) = (1 + (1/33 -2x) ) sqrt( (1/33 -2x) )

Simplify the right-hand side:

1 + (1/33 -2x) ) = (1 +1/33) -2x = (34/33) -2x.

Sqrt of (1/33 -2x) is sqrt(y).

So,

2 (1 +x) sqrt(x) = (34/33 -2x) sqrt( (1/33 -2x) )

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can neglect 2x compared to 34/33.

Wait, 34/33 is about 1.03, so 34/33 -2x ≈ 1.03 - 2x.

But perhaps x is small, like a small fraction.

Let me make an initial guess.

Assume that x is much smaller than 1, so 1+x ≈1.

Similarly, 34/33 -2x ≈ 34/33.

So,

Left side: 2 *1 * sqrt(x) = 2 sqrt(x).

Right side: (34/33) * sqrt( 1/33 ) ) → since 1/33 -2x ≈1/33.

So,

2 sqrt(x) = (34/33) * sqrt(1/33).

Compute (34/33) * sqrt(1/33):

34/(33) = ~1.03.

sqrt(1/33) = 1/sqrt(33) ≈0.174.

So,

1.03 *0.174 ≈0.179.

So,

2 sqrt(x) =0.179 → sqrt(x) ≈0.0895 → x≈0.00799.

So, x≈0.00799.

Then, y=1/33 - 2x = 0.0303 - 2*(0.00799) = 0.0303 -0.01598 ≈0.0143.

So,

x=0.00799 → T1 =198 x ≈198 *0.00799 ≈1.58 GeV.

y=0.0143 → T2=99 *0.0143 ≈1.416 GeV.

Sum T1 +T2 = 1.58 +1.416≈3.0 MeV? Wait, no, 1.58+1.416=2.996 GeV, which is ~3 GeV. Correct.

Now, let's plug these back into the momentum equation to see if the approximation holds.

So, compute 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) and (34/33 -2x) sqrt(1/33 -2x).

With x=0.00799,

1+x=1.00799.

sqrt(x)=sqrt(0.00799)=≈0.0894.

So,

2 *1.00799 *0.0894 ≈2 *1.008 *0.0894 ≈ 0.181.

On the right side,

34/33 -2x =1.0303-0.01598≈1.0143.

sqrt(1/33 -2x)=sqrt(0.0303 -0.01598)=sqrt(0.0143)=≈0.1196.

So,

1.0143 *0.1196 ≈0.1213.

Wait, but the left is ~0.181, right is ~0.1213. They're not equal, so the initial approximation isn't sufficient.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that a better approximation is needed.

Let me adjust x and y.

Let me try a better approximation.

We have,

Equation 1: 2 (1+x) sqrt(x) = (34/33 -2x) sqrt( (1/33) -2x )

Equation 2: 2x + y = 1/33, y=1/33 -2x.

We can try to solve these numerically.

Let me set up an iterative approach.

Let me assume initial x=0.008, y=0.0303 -2*0.008=0.0303-0.016=0.0143.

Compute left side: 2*(1.008)*sqrt(0.008)= 2*1.008 *0.0894≈ 0.181.

Right side: (34/33 -0.016) * sqrt(0.0303-0.016). 

34/33=1.0303, 1.0303-0.016=1.0143.

0.0303-0.016=0.0143.

sqrt(0.0143)=0.1196.

So right side=1.0143 *0.1196≈0.1212.

So left=0.181, right=0.1212. Need to increase right.

Since right is smaller than left, perhaps we need to increase x, which would lower y, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to increase x to make the left side larger, but let's see.

Wait, let me consider that the left side increases as x increases, because sqrt(x) increases. The right side, though, depends on both terms: (34/33 -2x) and sqrt( ... ), which decrease as x increases.

So perhaps increasing x will increase left side, but decrease right side. So perhaps it's better to lower x.

Wait, but in the first iteration, x=0.008, left=0.181, right=0.1212. So left is larger. So perhaps we need to lower x.

Let me try x=0.006.

Then, y=1/33 -2*0.006=0.0303-0.012=0.0183.

Left side:2*(1.006)*sqrt(0.006)=2*(1.006)*0.0775 ≈ 2 *1.006 *0.0775 ≈ 0.156.

Right side: (34/33 -0.012)=1.0303 -0.012=1.0183.

sqrt(0.0303 -0.012)=sqrt(0.0183)=≈0.1353.

So, right=1.0183 *0.1353≈0.1375.

Now, left=0.156, right=0.1375. Still left>right. So need to increase right.

We need to make right bigger. How? Since right is (34/33 -2x) * sqrt(1/33 -2x), which is a function that increases when x is small but decreases when x increases beyond a point.

Wait, perhaps taking x=0.007.

x=0.007 → y=0.0303 - 0.014=0.0163.

Left: 2*(1.007)*sqrt(0.007)=2*1.007 *0.0837 ≈2 *1.007 *0.0837≈0.170.

Right: (34/33 -0.014)=1.0303-0.014=1.0163.

sqrt(0.0303-0.014)=sqrt(0.0163)=≈0.1277.

Right=1.0163 *0.1277≈0.1299.

Left=0.170>right=0.1299. Still not matching.

Hmm. Let's try x=0.005.

y=0.0303-0.01=0.0203.

Left:2*(1.005)*sqrt(0.005)=2 *1.005 *0.0707≈2 *1.005 *0.0707≈0.142.

Right: (34/33 -0.01)=1.0303-0.01=1.0203.

sqrt(0.0303 -0.01)=sqrt(0.0203)=≈0.1424.

Right=1.0203 *0.1424≈0.1456.

Now, left≈0.142, right≈0.1456. Close, but left<right.

So, now, we have left < right.

We need to find x where 2(1+x)sqrt(x)= (34/33-2x) sqrt(1/33-2x).

At x=0.005, left=0.142 < right=0.1456.

At x=0.006, left=0.156> right=0.1375.

Wait, no, earlier at x=0.006, right was 0.1375, which was less than left (0.156).

Wait, perhaps better to plot or use a better method, but perhaps I can use linear approximation.

Let me consider x around 0.005 and 0.006.

At x=0.005: left=0.142, right=0.1456.

At x=0.006: left=0.156, right=0.1375.

We need to find x where left equals right.

The function f(x)= left - right.

At x=0.005: f=0.142-0.1456= -0.0036.

At x=0.006: f=0.156-0.1375= +0.0185.

We need to find x where f(x)=0.

Assuming linear variation between x=0.005 and 0.006.

The change in x is 0.001.

Change in f is from -0.0036 to +0.0185: total change 0.0221.

We need to find when f=0.

So, from x=0.005, we need to go (0.0036)/(0.0221) fraction of 0.001.

Fraction= 0.0036 /0.0221≈0.163.

So, x=0.005 +0.163*(0.001)≈0.005163.

So x≈0.005163.

So, x≈0.00516.

Then,

y=1/33 -2x =0.0303 - 2*(0.00516 )=0.0303 -0.01032=0.02.

So, x=0.00516 → T1=198 * x= 198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

y=0.02 → T2=99 *0.02=1.98 GeV.

Check: T1 +T2=1.016+1.98=3 GeV. Correct.

Now, compute left and right with x=0.00516.

Left: 2*(1+0.00516)*sqrt(0.00516).

Compute:

1+0.00516=1.00516.

sqrt(0.00516)=≈0.0718.

So,

2 *1.00516 *0.0718 ≈2 *1.00516 *0.0718 ≈0.144.

Right: (34/33 -2*0.00516) * sqrt(1/33 -2*0.00516).

Compute 34/33≈1.0303.

2*0.00516=0.01032.

So,

34/33 -0.01032=1.0303 -0.01032=1.02.

And,

1/33 -0.01032≈0.0303 -0.01032=0.02.

sqrt(0.02)=≈0.1414.

So,

Right=1.02 *0.1414≈0.1442.

Left=0.144, right≈0.1442. Close enough.

So, x≈0.00516.

Thus, T1=198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

So, the relativistic T1 is approximately 1.016 GeV, which is 1016 MeV.

Wait, but the non-relativistic T1 was 1 GeV, so the difference is about 1.6 MeV.

But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my approximation is not accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact relativistic equations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that in the center of momentum frame, the velocities are related by their masses.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that the kinetic energy is small, so velocities are low, and use a binomial expansion for gamma.

Gamma = 1 + (1/2) v²/c² + (3/8) v^4/c^4 + ...

But since v^2/c² is small, we can approximate gamma as 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, for the larger fragment (mass 2m):

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *2m c² ≈ (v1²/(2 c²)) *2m c² = m v1².

Similarly, for the smaller fragment:

T2≈ m v2².

Wait, but this seems to bring us back to the non-relativistic case, which can't be right because in reality, the relativistic case gives a higher T1 than the non-relativistic.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the relativistic T1 was about 1.016 GeV, and non-relativistic was 1 GeV, so the difference is about 0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

Which is close to option B (5 MeV) or C (10 MeV). Hmm, but 16 is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exact difference.

Wait, the correct T1 is approximately 1.016 GeV, and the non-rel T1 is 1 GeV. So the difference would be 0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

But the options don't have 16 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, but in the non-rel case, the sum is also 3 GeV. So the difference would be (rel T1) - (non-rel T1) = (1.016 GeV -1 GeV) =0.016 GeV=16 MeV.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me check the earlier assumption that T1 is 198 x.

Wait, in the relativistic case, T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

In the approximation method, we found x=gamma1 -1=0.00516, so T1=198 *0.00516≈1.016 GeV.

The non-rel T1 is (using the non-rel calculation) 1 GeV.

So the difference is 0.016 GeV =16 MeV.

But this isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Is there another approach? Perhaps using the fact that the kinetic energy is small and using a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact relativistic T1.

Let me consider the exact equations.

We have:

p1 = gamma1 * 198 * v1.

p2 = gamma2 *99 * v2.

And p1 = - p2.

So,

gamma1 *198 v1 = gamma2 *99 v2.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Now, v = beta c.

So,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

We can write beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma2²).

We also have,

T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

T1=(gamma1 -1)*198, T2=(gamma2 -1)*99.

So,

198(gamma1 -1) +99(gamma2 -1) =3.

Divide both sides by 99:

2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 = 1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 1/33 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1/33 +3 = 3 + 0.0303 ≈3.0303.

Wait, no:

Wait, 2(gamma1-1) + (gamma2 -1) =1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 =1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 +1/33 ≈3.0303.

Wait, that's 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Hmm, let's denote equation 3: 2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303.

And equation 4: 2 gamma1 sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1-1/gamma2²).

This is a system of two equations with two variables, gamma1 and gamma2.

This might be tricky to solve, but perhaps we can make an assumption that gamma2 is approximately twice gamma1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express gamma2 from equation 3 and substitute into equation 4.

From equation3,

gamma2=3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation4:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) = (3.0303 -2 gamma1) sqrt(1 -1/( (3.0303 -2 gamma1)^2 )).

This equation is complex, but perhaps we can assume gamma1 is close to 1 since the kinetic energy is small.

Let me assume gamma1=1 + a, where a is small.

Similarly, gamma2=3.0303 -2(1 +a)= 3.0303 -2 -2a=1.0303 -2a.

Since a is small, gamma2 is approximately 1.03, which is reasonable.

Now, let's express sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) in terms of a.

gamma1=1+a → 1/gamma1²≈1 - 2a + 3a².

So,

sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = sqrt( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² )=sqrt( (2a + ... ) / (1+2a)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2a) [using approximation for small a].

Similarly, sqrt(1-1/gamma2² )=sqrt( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2² )= sqrt( (gamma2-1)(gamma2+1) )/gamma2.

gamma2=1.0303 -2a → gamma2-1=0.0303 -2a.

gamma2+1=2.0303 -2a.

But since a is small, gamma2+1≈2.03.

So,

sqrt( (0.0303 -2a) *2.03 ) / (1.0303 -2a) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.0303)(2.03) ) / (1.03) → sqrt(0.0614) /1.03 ≈0.248 /1.03≈0.240.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

But perhaps this approach isn't the best. Maybe I can use another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that gamma2 is approximately twice gamma1, but given that the larger fragment is twice as massive, that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try a trial and error approach.

Let me try gamma1=1.005.

Then,

gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.005=3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

Now,

Left side: 2 *1.005 * sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2).

1.005^2=1.010025 → 1/1.010025≈0.9901.

So, 1-0.9901=0.0099.

sqrt(0.0099)=0.0995.

So,

2 *1.005 *0.0995≈2 *1.005 *0.0995≈0.199.

Right side: gamma2 * sqrt(1-1/gamma2²).

gamma2=1.0203.

gamma2^2=1.0412.

1/gamma2^2≈0.9609.

1-0.9609=0.0391.

sqrt(0.0391)=0.1977.

So,

Right=1.0203 *0.1977≈0.201.

Left≈0.199, right≈0.201. Close enough.

So, gamma1=1.005, gamma2≈1.0203.

Thus,

T1= (gamma1 -1)*198 =0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

T2= (gamma2-1)*99 =0.0203 *99≈2.0097 GeV.

Sum: 0.99 +2.0097≈3.0 GeV. Correct.

So, T1=0.99 GeV.

In non-relativistic, T1 was 1 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.99 GeV -1 GeV= -0.01 GeV= -10 MeV.

Wait, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-rel) T1.

So, correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, non-rel is 1 GeV.

Difference is 0.99-1= -0.01 GeV= -10 MeV. Absolute difference is 10 MeV.

But the options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

So, the answer would be C)10 MeV.

But wait, earlier when I used the approximation with x=0.00516, I got T1=1.016 GeV, but with this trial and error approach, I got T1=0.99 GeV.

Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Because in the trial and error, I found gamma1=1.005, which would imply x=gamma1-1=0.005.

So, T1=198 *0.005=0.99 GeV.

But earlier, when I tried the x=0.005, the left and right were close but not matching, so perhaps the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV.

So, the difference between correct (0.99 GeV) and non-rel (1.0 GeV) is 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

So the answer is C)10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approximations to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of **300 GeV**.
- After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:
  - Fragment 1 (more massive): Rest mass = **198 GeV/c²**.
  - Fragment 2 (less massive): Rest mass = **99 GeV/c²**.
- The total rest mass of the fragments is **99%** of the initial mass, i.e., **297 GeV/c²**.
- The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is **3 GeV** (since the initial energy is 300 GeV, and the rest energy is 297 GeV).

### Key Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   300 \, \text{GeV} = (198 + 99) \, \text{GeV} + T_1 + T_2
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero:
   \[
   p_1 = p_2,
   \]
   where \( p_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 \) and \( p_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \). For the fragments, this implies:
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of each fragment is given by:
   \[
   T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2, \quad T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2.
   \]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
\]
Using momentum conservation:
\[
2 m v_1 = m v_2 \implies v_2 = 2 v_1.
\]
The kinetic energies are:
\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v_1^2 = m v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m (2v_1)^2 = 4 m v_1^2.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 m v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
For Fragment 1:
\[
T_1 = m v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is:
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2, \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Using \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and solving for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203.
\]
The kinetic energies are:
\[
T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2 = (1.005 - 1) \cdot 198 \, \text{GeV} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV},
\]
\[
T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2 = (1.0203 - 1) \cdot 99 \, \text{GeV} \approx 2.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
The total kinetic energy is:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} + 2.01 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \), and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = |T_{1, \text{rel}} - T_{1, \text{non-rel}}| = |0.99 - 1| \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.
