Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about an electron state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to calculate the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which form an orthonormal basis. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but the state is said to be proportional to that. So I think I need to normalize this state because the given coefficients might not sum to 1 in magnitude squared.

Wait, normalization is crucial because probabilities must add up to 1. The normalization factor would be the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let me compute the normalization first.

The coefficients are a = 1+i and b = 2−i. The magnitude squared of a is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, since |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, |b|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total magnitude squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Alright, now the next part is about another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix where A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11=0, A_22=0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives exactly the A matrix given here.

So, the operator in question is A = (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, scaled by (hbar/2). Because if |+x> and |−x> are the eigenstates of σ_x, then they are also eigenstates of A.

Wait, no. Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so A has eigenvalues ±(hbar/2). But the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. The eigenstates |+x> and |−x> are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, right?

Alternatively, I can find the eigenstates of A and then compute the inner product with |alpha> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, perhaps I can find the expectation value and probabilities using the state |alpha>.

Another approach: since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's given as an observable with real eigenvalues), the eigenstates form a basis. So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of these eigenstates, and the square of the coefficients give the probabilities.

So, let me find the eigenstates of A. Since A = (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), I think. Let me confirm that.

Wait, σ_x acting on |+x> gives |+x>, so yes, the eigenstates are those.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>.

So now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the expansion coefficients, whose squares will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values and other properties using the matrix elements.

Wait, another approach: the probabilities of measuring a particular eigenvalue are given by the square of the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenstate.

So let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates of A.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait: I think I got that wrong. Let me think again.

The Pauli X matrix σ_x has eigenstates:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)

|−x> = (|up> − |down>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, no, because σ_x acting on |+x> gives |+x>, correct?

Wait, let me check. σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for the state |+x> = |0> in the computational basis, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct this.

The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait, actually, σ_x flips the spin in the x-direction. Let me think in terms of spin states. The |up> state is spin-up along z, and |down> is spin-down along z. The spin-up along x is the state that is a superposition of |up> and |down> so that it's symmetric. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, as I said.

So now, I need to compute the inner product < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

Because the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha >|^2, and similarly for -hbar/2.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

First, write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>

Where c_up = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) and c_down = (2−i)/sqrt(7).

Then, < +x | alpha > is equal to [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>.

Which is [ c_up * <up|up> + c_down * <down|up> ] / sqrt(2) ?

Wait no, more accurately, it's [ < up | + < down | ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>, which is c_up |up> + c_down |down>.

So:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ c_up * <up|up> + c_down * <down|up> ]

But <up|up> is 1, and <down|up> is 0 because they're orthonormal.

Wait no, wait: wait, < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ c_up^* + c_down^* ] ?

Wait no, no. Let me compute it step by step.

| +x > = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)

So the bra vector < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So when I take < +x | alpha >, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha > + <down| alpha > ]

<up| alpha > is the coefficient c_up, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Similarly, <down| alpha > is c_down, (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So putting that in:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) )

Simplify the numerator:

(1+i) + (2−i) = (1+2) + (i - i) )= 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, let's compute < -x | alpha >.

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha > - <down| alpha > ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute numerator:

(1+i) - (2 - i) = 1 -2 + i +i = (-1) + 2i

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but that would sum to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the probabilities again. Because sometimes I might get confused with the signs.

P(+x) is (3/sqrt(14))² =9/14 ≈0.6429, and P(-x) is | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |². The modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5, so 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which are close to the options given.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these.

But wait, let me also compute the expectation value of the operator A, which is the average value.

The expectation value <A> is calculated as < alpha | A | alpha >.

But A is a 2x2 matrix. Alternatively, since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, the expectation value can be found as (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the state |alpha>.

So <A> = (hbar/2) < alpha | σ_x | alpha >.

Alternatively, since σ_x = |+x><+x| - |−x><−x|, but wait, no, because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the expectation value is sum eigenvalue * probability.

So <σ_x> = (+1)*P(+x) + (-1)*P(-x) )= (9/14)(+1) + (5/14)(-1) )= (9 -5)/14 =4/14=2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7) * 2/2? Wait, no:

Wait, <σ_x> is 9/14 -5/14 =4/14=2/7.

So <A> is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7) * (2/2 is 1) → So <A> = hbar/(7) * (2/7? ) Wait no, let me recompute.

Wait, <A> = (hbar/2) <σ_x> . Since σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, and <σ_x> is the expectation which is 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= (hbar * 2)/(2 *7) )= hbar/7.

So <A> is hbar/7.

Now, looking at the options, option A says average value is hbar/7. So option A's average is correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the expectation value. Because in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. So the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * P(+x) + (-hbar/2) * P(-x).

Which is (hbar/2)(9/14) - (hbar/2)(5/14 )= (9-5) hbar/(2*14) )= 4 hbar/(28 ) = hbar/7. Yep, same as before.

So the answer's average is hbar/7, which matches option A. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That's correct. So that's the right option.

The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, expressed as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is calculated as:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, σ_x, with eigenvalues ±1. The eigenstates of σ_x are:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, scaled by the factor (ħ/2).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates. The inner products are:

\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:

\[
⟨A⟩ = \langle α | A | α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle α | σ_x | α \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of σ_x in |α⟩ is:

\[
⟨σ_x⟩ = P(+x) - P(-x) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
⟨A⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ħ/7. These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which form an orthonormal basis. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but the state is said to be proportional to that. So I think I need to normalize this state because the given coefficients might not sum to 1 in magnitude squared.

Wait, normalization is crucial because probabilities must add up to 1. The normalization factor would be the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let me compute the normalization first.

The coefficients are a = 1+i and b = 2−i. The magnitude squared of a is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, since |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, |b|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total magnitude squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Alright, now the next part is about another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix where A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11=0, A_22=0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives exactly the A matrix given here.

Wait, no. Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so A has eigenvalues ±(hbar/2). But the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. The eigenstates |+x> and |−x> are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, σ_x acting on |+x> gives |+x>, so yes, the eigenstates are those.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>.

So now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the expansion coefficients, whose squares will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values and other properties using the matrix elements.

Wait, another approach: the probabilities of measuring a particular eigenvalue are given by the square of the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenstate.

So let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates of A.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait: I think I got that wrong. Let me think again.

The Pauli X matrix σ_x has eigenstates:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)

|−x> = (|up> − |down>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, no, because σ_x acting on |+x> gives |+x>, correct?

Wait, let me check. σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for the state |+x> = |0> in the computational basis, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct this.

The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait, actually, σ_x flips the spin in the x-direction. Let me think in terms of spin states. The |up> state is spin-up along z, and |down> is spin-down along z. The spin-up along x is the state that is a superposition of |up> and |down> so that it's symmetric. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, as I said.

So now, I need to compute the inner product < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

Because the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha >|^2, and similarly for -hbar/2.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

First, write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>

Where c_up = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) and c_down = (2−i)/sqrt(7).

Then, < +x | alpha > is equal to [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>.

Which is [ c_up * <up|up> + c_down * <down|up> ] / sqrt(2) ?

Wait no, more accurately, it's [ < up | + < down | ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>, which is c_up |up> + c_down |down>.

So:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ c_up * <up|up> + c_down * <down|up> ]

But <up|up> is 1, and <down|up> is 0 because they're orthonormal.

Wait no, wait: wait, < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ c_up^* + c_down^* ] ?

Wait no, no. Let me compute it step by step.

| +x > = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)

So the bra vector < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So when I take < +x | alpha >, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha > + <down| alpha > ]

<up| alpha > is the coefficient c_up, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Similarly, <down| alpha > is c_down, (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So putting that in:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) )

Simplify the numerator:

(1+i) + (2−i) = (1+2) + (i - i) )= 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, let's compute < -x | alpha >.

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha > - <down| alpha > ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute numerator:

(1+i) - (2 - i) = 1 -2 + i +i = (-1) + 2i

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but that would sum to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the probabilities again. Because sometimes I might get confused with the signs.

P(+x) is (3/sqrt(14))² =9/14 ≈0.6429, and P(-x) is | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |². The modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5, so 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which are close to the options given.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these.

But wait, let me also compute the expectation value of the operator A, which is the average value.

The expectation value <A> is calculated as < alpha | A | alpha >.

But A is a 2x2 matrix. Alternatively, since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, the expectation value can be found as (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the state |alpha>.

So <A> = (hbar/2) < alpha | σ_x | alpha >.

Alternatively, since σ_x = |+x><+x| - |−x><−x|, but wait, no, because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the expectation value is sum eigenvalue * probability.

So <σ_x> = (+1)*P(+x) + (-1)*P(-x) )= (9/14)(+1) + (5/14)(-1) )= (9 -5)/14 =4/14=2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7) * 2/2? Wait, no:

Wait, <σ_x> is 9/14 -5/14 =4/14=2/7.

So <A> is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7) * (2/2 is 1) → So <A> = hbar/(7) * (2/7? ) Wait no, let me recompute.

Wait, <A> = (hbar/2) <σ_x> . Since σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, and <σ_x> is the expectation which is 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= (hbar * 2)/(2 *7) )= hbar/7.

So <A> is hbar/7.

Now, looking at the options, option A says average value is hbar/7. So option A's average is correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the expectation value. Because in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. So the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * P(+x) + (-hbar/2) * P(-x).

Which is (hbar/2)(9/14) - (hbar/2)(5/14 )= (9-5) hbar/(2*14) )= 4 hbar/(28 ) = hbar/7. Yep, same as before.

So the answer's average is hbar/7, which matches option A. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That's correct. So that's the right option.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, expressed as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is calculated as:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, σ_x, with eigenvalues ±1. The eigenstates of σ_x are:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, scaled by the factor (ħ/2).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates. The inner products are:

\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:

\[
⟨A⟩ = \langle α | A | α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle α | σ_x | α \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of σ_x in |α⟩ is:

\[
⟨σ_x⟩ = P(+x) - P(-x) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
⟨A⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ħ/7. These match the values in **Option A**.
