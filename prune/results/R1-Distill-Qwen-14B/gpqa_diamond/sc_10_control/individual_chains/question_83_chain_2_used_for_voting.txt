Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, I'll tackle the dilution part. When you mix two solutions, the moles of solute stay the same, but the volume increases. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. Let me calculate that.

Moles of CH3COOH before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the concentration after dilution is moles divided by new volume. 

New concentration: 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Yes, and adding 0.02 L of water, makes 0.04 L. 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. Right.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. To find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence, I can use the formula M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is the concentration of acetic acid, which is 0.025 M. V1 is 40 cm³. M2 is 0.1 M NaOH. So V2 = (M1 * V1) / M2.

Wait, V1 is 40 cm³ because that's the total volume after dilution. So V2 = (0.025 M * 40 cm³) / 0.1 M. Let me compute that: 0.025 *40 = 1, then 1 / 0.1 = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Okay, but the question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let's start with the 25% titration point. 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Oh wait, wait. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the amount of NaOH added at equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, another approach is to consider the moles. Let me think.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. The moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 0.25 * 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles. Because at equivalence, you need 0.001 moles of NaOH (since 1:1 reaction), so 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

So, in the solution, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by that amount, and moles of acetate will increase by that amount.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of OH^- added: 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but wait, the NaOH is 2.5 cm³, so the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we have a weak acid and its conjugate base, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.735.

Wait, let me compute pKa correctly. Ka = 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's approximately 4.25.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = (25e-4) / (42.5e-3) )= (25e-4) / (42.5e-3) = (25/425) * (1e-4 / 1e-3) )= (0.05882) * 0.1 = 0.005882 M.

Similarly, 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (75e-4) / 42.5e-3 = (75 / 425) * 0.1 = (0.17647) *0.1 = 0.017647 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333333.

Log(0.3333) is indeed approximately -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, option D is 4.57. So the first value would be ~4.25, so perhaps option A or D. Wait, option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. So maybe that's the case.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution.

Wait, another approach: when you mix two solutions, the total volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is 0.025 M, as I calculated earlier.

Now, when 25% of the equivalence volume is added, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Which matches what I did earlier.

So, the calculations seem correct. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will contain only the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. Therefore, the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid has been converted). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH added at equivalence point. So total volume is 50 cm³, or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion acts as a base in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, calculate that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small, so x will be negligible compared to 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Because log(1e-5)=5, and log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH ≈ 5 - 0.017 = 4.983.

So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options given don't have a pH of around 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me see: original moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, which becomes 0.001 mol of acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So [acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct, but the pH is around 9.01, which isn't matching any of the options. The options have equivalence pH values as 6.73, 7.00, 6.92, or 8.52. None of these are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, at equivalence, the solution is made by mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and NaOH. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, diluted with 20 cm³ of water. Then, when titrated, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added at equivalence.

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³.

Wait, but the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid, 40 cm³. When you add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the moles of acetate are 0.001, as before. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So my earlier calculation seems right.

Wait, but why is the pH so high? Because acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic. But according to my calculation, pH is ~9.01, but the options don't have any equivalence pH above 8.52 except option A. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Another approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence correctly.

Wait, maybe I should use the hydrolysis equation more accurately, considering the exact value.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

At equilibrium, 

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → log(9.615e4) → wait no, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH=14-4.98=9.02. So the pH should be around 9.02.

But none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. So the equivalence pH is way off the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid's concentration. Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid→ 0.001 moles.

Diluted with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water: total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, but when titrating, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles.

The equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. That's correct.

So the total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → so pKa is ≈4.73.

At equivalence, the solution is a solution of acetate ion. The pH can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw) → Wait, that's when the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, and the concentration is such that [A^-] = [HA], but that's not the case here. Wait, no, that's the Henderson equation when the ratio is 1, so pH = pKa. But here, it's a solution of A^-, so the pH is determined by the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me re-calculate.

Kb = Kw / Ka → (1.0e-14) / (1.85e-5) → approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 1.0 / 1.85 is approximately 0.5405, as before.

Hmm. Let me re-express the Kb expression.

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

Then x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of NaOH added at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.01 L (10 cm³) = 0.001 moles. Correct.

So moles of acetate ion is 0.001.

Wait, but maybe I forgot that the solution is a buffer before equivalence, but at equivalence, it's a solution of acetate ion in water, hence basic.

Hmm, but then why do the options have equivalence pH values much lower than 9?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the diluted solution's concentration. Let me check again.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.001 moles. Then it's diluted with 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but when titrating, is the solution after dilution 0.025 M acetic acid, correct.

So another approach: perhaps the problem is that I'm mixing the diluted acetic acid with NaOH, so the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps the equivalence pH is being calculated incorrectly. Wait, another method to find the pH at equivalence is to compute it using the concentration of acetate and Kb as I did.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using the exact formula without assuming x is negligible.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me write it as x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5. So same as before.

But maybe it's better to solve it without the approximation.

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*1.081e-11.

Compute:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So total discriminant = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.32e-11).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

Thus,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6) /2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the previous approximation. Wait, that's because I didn't consider the exact quadratic solution. Wait, but 5.405e-10 is much smaller than 6.576e-6, so the -5.405e-10 is negligible. So x ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is larger than this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Wait, 5.405e-10 *0.02 is 1.081e-11.

So the equation is x² + 5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Applying quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11, as before.

So sqrt(D)= ~6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Which is [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

Wait, but earlier approximation without quadratic was x=~1.04e-5.

Wait, that's a discrepancy. So which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me think again. The correct expression is:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x) → x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So quadratic equation: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → as before.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

Thus, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 3.288e-6.

Wait, but that's about 3.29e-6 M. So [OH^-] =3.29e-6.

pOH =-log(3.29e-6) ≈5.48.

So pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, that's matching option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, so why the discrepancy between the two methods?

Because when I assumed x was much smaller than 0.02, I neglected the x in the denominator, which actually gives a better approximation. But when I used the quadratic approach, I get a different x.

Wait, the correct approach is to use the exact quadratic solution, but in this case, perhaps the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 holds, but maybe the initial approximation was wrong.

Wait, let me compute using x=3.29e-6:

[acetate]=0.02 -x ≈0.02 -3.29e-6 ≈0.01999967 M, which is essentially 0.02 M. So the approximation holds, and the quadratic solution is more accurate.

So with [OH^-]=3.29e-6, pOH=5.48, pH=8.52.

Ah, that matches option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5, which gave pH=9.02. But using the quadratic approach, it's 3.29e-6, pH=8.52.

So why the difference?

Ah, because when I first set up the equation, I assumed that x² = Kb * (0.02), which is an approximation. But the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation properly, which gives a lower x.

Wait, let's compute the exact value again.

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b + sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), since the other root would be negative.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

Thus, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, so the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52. That matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I tried the approximation without the quadratic, I thought x was 1.04e-5. I must have made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, what's 3.288e-6 in terms of pH? That's pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

Now, let's go back to the 25% titration point, where I calculated pH≈4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

So our calculation for 25% is approximately 4.25, which is close to 4.26. So option A has 4.26 as the first value and 8.52 as the second.

Wait, but let me double-check the 25% pH.

At 25% titration, we have:

moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol.

moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075 / 0.0425=0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa=4.73.

[A^-]/[HA] =0.005882/0.017647=0.3333.

log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253 → approx 4.25.

Which is very close to option A's first value of 4.26.

So the two values we've calculated are pH=4.25 at 25% and pH=8.52 at equivalence. So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option A) 4.26;8.52.

Yes, that matches.

But I thought earlier that the equivalence pH came out to be 8.52, which matches option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added. The equivalence volume of NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 mol of acetic acid is:

\[
V_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:

\[
V_{25\%} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.25\), which matches the first value in option A (\(4.26\)).

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is \(8.52\), which matches the second value in option A.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is \(8.52\). These values correspond to option A.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, I'll tackle the dilution part. When you mix two solutions, the moles of solute stay the same, but the volume increases. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. Let me calculate that.

Moles of CH3COOH before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the concentration after dilution is moles divided by new volume. 

New concentration: 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Yes, and adding 0.02 L of water, makes 0.04 L. 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. Right.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. To find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence, I can use the formula M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is the concentration of acetic acid, which is 0.025 M. V1 is 40 cm³. M2 is 0.1 M NaOH. So V2 = (M1 * V1) / M2.

Wait, V1 is 40 cm³ because that's the total volume after dilution. So V2 = (0.025 M * 40 cm³) / 0.1 M. Let me compute that: 0.025 *40 = 1, then 1 / 0.1 = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Okay, but the question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let's start with the 25% titration point. 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Oh wait, wait. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the amount of NaOH added at equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, another approach is to consider the moles. Let me think.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. The moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 0.25 * 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles. Because at equivalence, you need 0.001 moles of NaOH (since 1:1 reaction), so 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

So, in the solution, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by that amount, and moles of acetate will increase by that amount.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of OH^- added: 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but wait, the NaOH is 2.5 cm³, so the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since we have a weak acid and its conjugate base, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.735.

Wait, let me compute pKa correctly. Ka = 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's approximately 4.25.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = (25e-4) / (42.5e-3) )= (25e-4) / (42.5e-3) = (25/425) * (1e-4 / 1e-3) )= (0.05882) * 0.1 = 0.005882 M.

Similarly, 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (75e-4) / 42.5e-3 = (75 / 425) * 0.1 = (0.17647) *0.1 = 0.017647 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333333.

Log(0.3333) is indeed approximately -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, option D is 4.57. So the first value would be ~4.25, so perhaps option A or D. Wait, option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. So maybe that's the case.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution.

Wait, another approach: when you mix two solutions, the total volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is 0.025 M, as I calculated earlier.

Now, when 25% of the equivalence volume is added, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Which matches what I did earlier.

So, the calculations seem correct. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will contain only the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. Therefore, the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid has been converted). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH added at equivalence point. So total volume is 50 cm³, or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion acts as a base in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, calculate that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small, so x will be negligible compared to 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Because log(1e-5)=5, and log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH ≈ 5 - 0.017 = 4.983.

So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options given don't have a pH of around 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me see: original moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, which becomes 0.001 mol of acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So [acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct, but the pH is around 9.01, which isn't matching any of the options. The options have equivalence pH values as 6.73, 7.00, 6.92, or 8.52. None of these are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, at equivalence, the solution is made by mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and NaOH. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, diluted with 20 cm³ of water. Then, when titrated, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added at equivalence.

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³.

Wait, but the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid, 40 cm³. When you add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the moles of acetate are 0.001, as before. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So my earlier calculation seems right.

Wait, but why is the pH so high? Because acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic. But according to my calculation, pH is ~9.01, but the options don't have any equivalence pH above 8.52 except option A. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Another approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence correctly.

Wait, maybe I should use the hydrolysis equation more accurately, considering the exact value.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

At equilibrium, 

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → log(9.615e4) → wait no, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH=14-4.98=9.02. So the pH should be around 9.02.

But none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. So the equivalence pH is way off the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid's concentration. Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid→ 0.001 moles.

Diluted with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water: total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, but when titrating, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles.

The equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. That's correct.

So the total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → so pKa is ≈4.73.

At equivalence, the solution is a solution of acetate ion. The pH can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw) → Wait, that's when the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, and the concentration is such that [A^-] = [HA], but that's not the case here. Wait, no, that's the Henderson equation when the ratio is 1, so pH = pKa. But here, it's a solution of A^-, so the pH is determined by the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me re-calculate.

Kb = Kw / Ka → (1.0e-14) / (1.85e-5) → approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 1.0 / 1.85 is approximately 0.5405, as before.

Hmm. Let me re-express the Kb expression.

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

Then x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of NaOH added at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.01 L (10 cm³) = 0.001 moles. Correct.

So moles of acetate ion is 0.001.

Wait, but maybe I forgot that the solution is a buffer before equivalence, but at equivalence, it's a solution of acetate ion in water, hence basic.

Hmm, but then why do the options have equivalence pH values much lower than 9?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the diluted solution's concentration. Let me check again.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.001 moles. Then it's diluted with 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but when titrating, is the solution after dilution 0.025 M acetic acid, correct.

So another approach: perhaps the problem is that I'm mixing the diluted acetic acid with NaOH, so the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps the equivalence pH is being calculated incorrectly. Wait, another method to find the pH at equivalence is to compute it using the concentration of acetate and Kb as I did.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using the exact formula without assuming x is negligible.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me write it as x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5. So same as before.

But maybe it's better to solve it without the approximation.

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*1.081e-11.

Compute:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So total discriminant = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.32e-11).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

Thus,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6) /2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the previous approximation. Wait, that's because I didn't consider the exact quadratic solution. Wait, but 5.405e-10 is much smaller than 6.576e-6, so the -5.405e-10 is negligible. So x ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is larger than this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Wait, 5.405e-10 *0.02 is 1.081e-11.

So the equation is x² + 5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Applying quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11, as before.

So sqrt(D)= ~6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Which is [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

Wait, but earlier approximation without quadratic was x=~1.04e-5.

Wait, that's a discrepancy. So which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me think again. The correct expression is:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x) → x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So quadratic equation: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → as before.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

Thus, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 3.288e-6.

Wait, but that's about 3.29e-6 M. So [OH^-] =3.29e-6.

pOH =-log(3.29e-6) ≈5.48.

So pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, that's matching option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, so why the discrepancy between the two methods?

Because when I assumed x was much smaller than 0.02, I neglected the x in the denominator, which actually gives a better approximation. But when I used the quadratic approach, I get a different x.

Wait, the correct approach is to use the exact quadratic solution, but in this case, perhaps the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 holds, but maybe the initial approximation was wrong.

Wait, let me compute using x=3.29e-6:

[acetate]=0.02 -x ≈0.02 -3.29e-6 ≈0.01999967 M, which is essentially 0.02 M. So the approximation holds, and the quadratic solution is more accurate.

So with [OH^-]=3.29e-6, pOH=5.48, pH=8.52.

Ah, that matches option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5, which gave pH=9.02. But using the quadratic approach, it's 3.29e-6, pH=8.52.

So why the difference?

Ah, because when I first set up the equation, I assumed that x² = Kb * (0.02), which is an approximation. But the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation properly, which gives a lower x.

Wait, let's compute the exact value again.

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b + sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), since the other root would be negative.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

Thus, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, so the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52. That matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I tried the approximation without the quadratic, I thought x was 1.04e-5. I must have made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, what's 3.288e-6 in terms of pH? That's pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

Now, let's go back to the 25% titration point, where I calculated pH≈4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

So our calculation for 25% is approximately 4.25, which is close to 4.26. So option A has 4.26 as the first value and 8.52 as the second.

Wait, but let me double-check the 25% pH.

At 25% titration, we have:

moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol.

moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075 / 0.0425=0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa=4.73.

[A^-]/[HA] =0.005882/0.017647=0.3333.

log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253 → approx 4.25.

Which is very close to option A's first value of 4.26.

So the two values we've calculated are pH=4.25 at 25% and pH=8.52 at equivalence. So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option A) 4.26;8.52.

Yes, that matches.

But I thought earlier that the equivalence pH came out to be 8.52, which matches option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added. The equivalence volume of NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 mol of acetic acid is:

\[
V_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:

\[
V_{25\%} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.25\), which matches the first value in option A (\(4.26\)).

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is \(8.52\), which matches the second value in option A.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is \(8.52\). These values correspond to option A.
