Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me re-read the question to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. The components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made. So the eigenvector here is a state vector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n.

But wait, the operator P here is a vector operator, so when we talk about it along an arbitrary direction n, I think that means we need to consider the component of P in that direction. Oh right, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So P = n · (Px, Py, Pz) = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz.

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along n would be sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz, because the y-component is zero.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row (0,1), second row (1,0). That is, Px = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]].

And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P along direction n is:

P = n_x Px + n_z Pz + n_y Py. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So:

P = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Substituting the matrices:

P = sinθ*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute each element:

First row, first column: sinθ*0 + cosθ*1 = cosθ.

First row, second column: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ.

Second row, first column: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ.

Second row, second column: sinθ*0 + cosθ*(-1) = -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the operator P is this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = (ħ/2) [ a; b ]

Wait, let's write this equation.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the ħ/2 factor:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

So the matrix equation is:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a

[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So the two equations are:

(1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a

(2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation (1):

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0 → a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0.

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 → a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0.

So now we have two equations:

(1) a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

(2) a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0.

We can write this as a system:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ   ] [a]   = [0]

[ sinθ        -(cosθ +1) ] [b] = [0]

To find non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Calculate the determinant:

D = (cosθ -1)(- (cosθ +1)) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

= -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) - sin²θ

= -(cos²θ - 1 ) - sin²θ

Because (a-b)(a+b)=a² - b².

cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So,

= - ( - sin²θ ) - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So yes, the determinant is zero, which means the system has non-trivial solutions. So we can choose one equation to find the relation between a and b.

Let's take equation (1):

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0.

We can solve for a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, denominator is (cosθ -1) = - (1 - cosθ ). So,

a = [ (- b sinθ ) ] / ( - (1 - cosθ ) ) 

= [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

I can simplify this expression. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

a = [ b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

The 2's cancel. sin(θ/2) in numerator and denominator:

a = [ b cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ]

Which is equal to:

a = b [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = b cot(θ/2 )

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ b cot(theta/2 ); b ].

We can factor out b, so the vector becomes b [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector, so the sum of squares of the components should be 1.

Let me compute the normalization factor.

Let me denote the vector as [ a; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So,

|b|^2 [ (cot(theta/2 ))^2 + 1 ] = 1.

But cot^2 x + 1 = csc^2 x = 1/(sin^2 x )

So,

|b|^2 * (1 / sin^2(theta/2) ) ) = 1.

So |b|^2 = sin^2(theta/2 )

Thus, |b| is sin(theta/2 ), and since it's a normalization, the phase can be chosen as positive.

So, b = sin(theta/2 ), and a = cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Because cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 )

So a = [ cos(theta/2 ) ]

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the components are a and b, which are the coefficients of the basis vectors. So the vector is:

[ a; b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Because from earlier, a = cos(theta/2 ), and b = sin(theta/2 ), correct? Because a = b cot(theta/2 ), and b = sin(theta/2 ), so a = [ sin(theta/2 ) ] cot(theta/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2 ) ] ( cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 ) ) ) = cos(theta/2 )

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the eigenvalue. I derived the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2? Because when we wrote P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, so yes.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector of operator P along n, which we derived, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). Option D has factors multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, but I don't see hbar in the vector elements. Wait, no. The options for the eigenvector elements are given as (something involving hbar?), but wait, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are dimensionless, because the state vectors are normalized.

Wait, the options say things like sqrt(2/3) hbar — but that can't be right because hbar has units of energy*time, so the components can't have hbar. Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of the basis and the coefficients are just the amplitudes, so the hbar might be a typo or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says to calculate the eigenvector, but the options have elements with hbar. Hmm, that seems odd. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are unit vectors (if normalized), so their components are dimensionless. So perhaps the options are written with a scaling factor, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, checking the options again:

Option A: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) — these have hbar, so units of ħ.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ) — dimensionless.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but the components of the eigenvector should be dimensionless. So perhaps the options are written in terms of some scaled variables, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the eigenvector of P, but of the spin operator along direction n. Because the operator given (P) looks like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, similar to the spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator P along any direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz )

So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

The eigenvectors for spin-up along n are given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), where theta and phi are the spherical angles defining the direction n.

But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but in this problem, n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero, so phi is zero? Or is it some other phi? Wait, when a direction is in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero because the direction lies along the x-z plane, so it's either in the x or z direction.

Wait, no. The definition of phi is the angle in the x-y plane measured from the x-axis. So if the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero or pi? Or actually, if the direction is in x-z plane, its projection onto x-y plane is zero. So the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), which implies phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), as I previously derived.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), which matches.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], assuming they're normalized. Let me verify the normalization:

cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) = 1. Yes, that's correct.

So option C is this vector.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh! Wait, the eigenvector I found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the spin-up state.

Yes, in the standard spin-1/2 system, the spin-up state along direction n is (cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ), which when phi is zero becomes (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which is option C.

So why are the other options present? Let's look at each option:

Option A: Looks like it's a vector with hbar, but that's probably incorrect because the components should be dimensionless.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would correspond to theta being the polar angle, but that's not the correct parametrization for the eigenvector. Because the usual parametrization uses theta/2.

Option C: As discussed, correct.

Option D: Looks like it's scaled by sqrt(2/3) hbar etc., which I'm not sure about. Also, the presence of hbar in the options suggests they might have a different normalization.

Wait, could it be that the question's operator is scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector equations are derived correctly, so the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), making option C the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an operator where the eigenvalue is in terms of ħ, but the eigenvector remains normalized.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the equations.

We started with the operator P along n, which is sinθ Px + cosθ Pz. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. So the total operator is (ħ/2)[ cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ ]

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which simplifies to the matrix equation leading to a = cos(theta/2 ), b = sin(theta/2 ), normalized.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )).

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The operator along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

we compute:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0.
\]

Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = b \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b$, we find:

\[
|b|^2 \left[\cot^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 1\right] = 1.
\]

Using the identity $\cot^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 1 = \csc^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, we get:

\[
|b|^2 = \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad |b| = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.
- **B** uses $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$ instead of $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, which is the correct parametrization for the eigenvector.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me re-read the question to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. The components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made. So the eigenvector here is a state vector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n.

But wait, the operator P here is a vector operator, so when we talk about it along an arbitrary direction n, I think that means we need to consider the component of P in that direction. Oh right, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So P = n · (Px, Py, Pz) = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz.

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along n would be sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz, because the y-component is zero.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row (0,1), second row (1,0). That is, Px = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]].

And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P along direction n is:

P = n_x Px + n_z Pz + n_y Py. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So:

P = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Substituting the matrices:

P = sinθ*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute each element:

First row, first column: sinθ*0 + cosθ*1 = cosθ.

First row, second column: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ.

Second row, first column: sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ.

Second row, second column: sinθ*0 + cosθ*(-1) = -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the operator P is this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = (ħ/2) [ a; b ]

Wait, let's write this equation.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the ħ/2 factor:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

So the matrix equation is:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a

[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So the two equations are:

(1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a

(2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation (1):

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0 → a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0.

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 → a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0.

So now we have two equations:

(1) a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

(2) a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0.

We can write this as a system:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ   ] [a]   = [0]

[ sinθ        -(cosθ +1) ] [b] = [0]

To find non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Calculate the determinant:

D = (cosθ -1)(- (cosθ +1)) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

= -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) - sin²θ

= -(cos²θ - 1 ) - sin²θ

Because (a-b)(a+b)=a² - b².

cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So,

= - ( - sin²θ ) - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So yes, the determinant is zero, which means the system has non-trivial solutions. So we can choose one equation to find the relation between a and b.

Let's take equation (1):

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0.

We can solve for a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, denominator is (cosθ -1) = - (1 - cosθ ). So,

a = [ (- b sinθ ) ] / ( - (1 - cosθ ) ) 

= [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

I can simplify this expression. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

a = [ b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

The 2's cancel. sin(θ/2) in numerator and denominator:

a = [ b cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ]

Which is equal to:

a = b [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = b cot(θ/2 )

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ b cot(theta/2 ); b ].

We can factor out b, so the vector becomes b [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector, so the sum of squares of the components should be 1.

Let me compute the normalization factor.

Let me denote the vector as [ a; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So,

|b|^2 [ (cot(theta/2 ))^2 + 1 ] = 1.

But cot^2 x + 1 = csc^2 x = 1/(sin^2 x )

So,

|b|^2 * (1 / sin^2(theta/2) ) ) = 1.

So |b|^2 = sin^2(theta/2 )

Thus, |b| is sin(theta/2 ), and since it's a normalization, the phase can be chosen as positive.

So, b = sin(theta/2 ), and a = cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Because cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 )

So a = [ cos(theta/2 ) ]

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the components are a and b, which are the coefficients of the basis vectors. So the vector is:

[ a; b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Because from earlier, a = cos(theta/2 ), and b = sin(theta/2 ), correct? Because a = b cot(theta/2 ), and b = sin(theta/2 ), so a = [ sin(theta/2 ) ] cot(theta/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2 ) ] ( cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 ) ) ) = cos(theta/2 )

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the eigenvalue. I derived the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2? Because when we wrote P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, so yes.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector of operator P along n, which we derived, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). Option D has factors multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, but I don't see hbar in the vector elements. Wait, no. The options for the eigenvector elements are given as (something involving hbar?), but wait, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are dimensionless, because the state vectors are normalized.

Wait, the options say things like sqrt(2/3) hbar — but that can't be right because hbar has units of energy*time, so the components can't have hbar. Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of the basis and the coefficients are just the amplitudes, so the hbar might be a typo or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says to calculate the eigenvector, but the options have elements with hbar. Hmm, that seems odd. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are unit vectors (if normalized), so their components are dimensionless. So perhaps the options are written with a scaling factor, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, checking the options again:

Option A: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) — these have hbar, so units of ħ.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ) — dimensionless.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but the components of the eigenvector should be dimensionless. So perhaps the options are written in terms of some scaled variables, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the eigenvector of P, but of the spin operator along direction n. Because the operator given (P) looks like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, similar to the spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator P along any direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz )

So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

The eigenvectors for spin-up along n are given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), where theta and phi are the spherical angles defining the direction n.

But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but in this problem, n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero, so phi is zero? Or is it some other phi? Wait, when a direction is in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero because the direction lies along the x-z plane, so it's either in the x or z direction.

Wait, no. The definition of phi is the angle in the x-y plane measured from the x-axis. So if the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero or pi? Or actually, if the direction is in x-z plane, its projection onto x-y plane is zero. So the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), which implies phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), as I previously derived.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), which matches.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], assuming they're normalized. Let me verify the normalization:

cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) = 1. Yes, that's correct.

So option C is this vector.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh! Wait, the eigenvector I found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the spin-up state.

Yes, in the standard spin-1/2 system, the spin-up state along direction n is (cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ), which when phi is zero becomes (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which is option C.

So why are the other options present? Let's look at each option:

Option A: Looks like it's a vector with hbar, but that's probably incorrect because the components should be dimensionless.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would correspond to theta being the polar angle, but that's not the correct parametrization for the eigenvector. Because the usual parametrization uses theta/2.

Option C: As discussed, correct.

Option D: Looks like it's scaled by sqrt(2/3) hbar etc., which I'm not sure about. Also, the presence of hbar in the options suggests they might have a different normalization.

Wait, could it be that the question's operator is scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector equations are derived correctly, so the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), making option C the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an operator where the eigenvalue is in terms of ħ, but the eigenvector remains normalized.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the equations.

We started with the operator P along n, which is sinθ Px + cosθ Pz. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. So the total operator is (ħ/2)[ cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ ]

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which simplifies to the matrix equation leading to a = cos(theta/2 ), b = sin(theta/2 ), normalized.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )).


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The operator along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

we compute:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0.
\]

Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = b \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b$, we find:

\[
|b|^2 \left[\cot^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 1\right] = 1.
\]

Using the identity $\cot^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 1 = \csc^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, we get:

\[
|b|^2 = \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad |b| = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.
- **B** uses $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$ instead of $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, which is the correct parametrization for the eigenvector.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
