Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀, which is 8e-16 seconds. I remember proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. The problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, it's the lifetime measured when the particle is at rest. But in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. So I need to calculate the lifetime in the lab frame first.

Time dilation formula is gamma times tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but since the units here are in GeV and GeV/c², I need to be careful. Wait, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. Oh wait, no, X⁰ is at rest? No, wait, no. Wait, the particle X⁰ is moving in the lab frame because it's in the Bubble Chamber, which is the lab frame. So X⁰ is moving, hence its lifetime is longer.

So gamma is E/(m c²), but in natural units where c=1, E in GeV and m also in GeV/c², so E/(m c²) becomes E/(m) when c=1. Wait, actually, in natural units, c is 1, so E = gamma m, so gamma = E / m. So for X⁰, gamma would be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 * 8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 3.41 * 8 is approximately 27.28, so 27 is a bit less than 8 times. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so tau ≈ 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, what's the point of the lifetime? Oh, right, the lifetime determines the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the average path length is v * tau. Wait, but maybe the speed is approximately c? Because particles moving at high energies are close to the speed of light. So v ≈ c.

So the average path length L = v * tau ≈ c * tau. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Wait, 3e8 times 6e-15 is (3 *6) =18, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. So 18e-7 meters, which is 1.8e-6 meters. Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately. 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = 3 *6.328 = 18.984, and 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7, so 18.984e-7 meters. 18.984e-7 is 1.8984e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So I think the idea is that the resolution of the detector needs to be good enough to distinguish the decay vertices that are a certain distance apart. But wait, if the particle's path length is L, then in the detector, you can see the decay if the two decay products are within the resolution. But I'm not exactly sure how the 30% comes into play.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of decays observed. If the decay length is L, the probability of observing the decay is when the path length is such that the detector can resolve it. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the minimum distance that the decay products travel so that the detector can register a vertex displacement, and hence the decay is observed. So the fraction of decays observed depends on whether the decay occurs within the detector's volume, or perhaps whether the path is long enough to be detected.

Wait, another approach: the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, beta is v/c. But in the earlier calculation, I assumed v≈c, so beta≈1. So the decay length L is about gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution required so that the detector can resolve the decay products' tracks. So, if the decay occurs, the particles Y and Z will leave tracks. The longer the decay length, the further apart the decay products' tracks are. So the detector must have a resolution (finest detail it can see) less than the decay length.

But wait, the question says, "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Hmm. So perhaps, if the decay length is longer than the detector's resolution, you can observe the decay. So the fraction observed would be 30%. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimum path length such that 30% of the decays are observed. Wait, but how does the resolution relate to the number of decays observed? Oh, perhaps if the resolution is better (smaller), you can see more decays because you can distinguish the decay vertex more clearly. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper way to compute the decay length, and then the resolution must be smaller than that length to detect the decay. So the minimum resolution is the decay length divided by a certain factor. Hmm.

Wait, but I think the key here is to compute the decay length and then use that as the required resolution. So the minimum resolution needed would be the decay length L. Because if the detector's resolution is less than L, it can resolve the decay.

Wait, let me think again. The decay length L is how far the X⁰ travels before decaying. The Bubble Chamber can detect the decay if the particles Y and Z leave tracks that are separated by a distance that the chamber can resolve. So the resolution must be at least on the order of the decay length. Wait no, actually, the better the resolution (smaller the minimum detectable distance), the more decays you can observe because you can see the decay vertex more clearly. So to observe a certain percentage of the decays, you need a certain minimal resolution.

Wait, alternatively, the problem might be asking for the minimum resolution that allows detection, which is when the decay length is just detectable. But I'm not entirely clear on how the 30% comes into play. Oh wait, perhaps 30% of the possible path length, or that the decay is observed in 30% of the cases? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the number 30% refers to the fraction of the possible decay length that the detector must resolve. So, the decay length is L, and the detector's resolution must be such that it can detect a displacement of at least 30% of L. Hmm, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the proper calculation of the decay length, and the minimum resolution is just the decay length itself. Because if the detector's resolution is equal to the decay length, you can just barely detect the decay. So, perhaps the answer is the decay length.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L as approximately 1.9e-6 meters, which is 1.9 micrometers. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. So that would fit. But why 30%? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

Gamma is E/m. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 7.915 *8e-16. Let's compute this: 7.915 *8 is approximately 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s, which is 6.332e-15 seconds.

Then, L = c * tau_lab. c is 3e8 m/s, so:

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.332e-15 s = 3 *6.332e-7 m = 1.8996e-6 m, which is about 1.90e-6 meters or 1.9 micrometers.

So the decay length is approximately 1.9 micrometers. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 meters, which is close to 2 micrometers. Hmm. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to compute beta and then include that in the decay length formula. Wait, decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Earlier I assumed beta ≈ 1, but perhaps X⁰ is not moving at exactly the speed of light.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So the total energy E is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E=gamma m.

So beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma using the relation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute beta.

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.915)^2)).

Compute 7.915 squared: 7.915^2 = approximately (7.9)^2 = 62.41. But more accurately, (7.915)^2 = (7.9)^2 + 2*(7.9)*(0.015) + (0.015)^2. 7.9^2 is 62.41. 2*7.9*0.015 = 0.237. 0.015^2=0.000225. So total 62.41 + 0.237 +0.000225 ≈62.6472.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.6472) = sqrt(1 - 0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is approximately 0.992.

So, the decay length should be L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So let me compute that.

gamma=7.915, beta=0.992.

gamma*beta ≈7.915 *0.992 ≈7.86.

So L =7.86 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L≈7.86 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.86: 2.4e-7 *7.86=18.864e-7 m=1.8864e-6 m.

So approximately 1.8864e-6 meters, which is 1.8864 micrometers.

Hmm, but none of the options is exactly this. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

gamma =27 /3.41. Let me compute 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *8=27.28. 27 is between 7*3.41 and 8*3.41. So 27/3.41 = approximately 7.915.

Alternatively, 3.41 *7.915 = let me compute 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41 *0.915= approx 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.015=0.05115. So 3.069 +0.05115=3.12015. So total 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015. So 3.41 *7.915≈26.99, which is just about 27. So gamma is indeed 7.915.

Calculating beta again: gamma is 7.915, so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.915)^2)).

7.915^2 is 7.915*7.915.

Let me compute it more accurately.

7.915 *7.915 = (7 +0.915)^2 = 49 + 2*7*0.915 + (0.915)^2.

Compute each term:

49 is 49.

2*7*0.915=14 *0.915=12.81.

(0.915)^2 = approx 0.837225.

So sum is 49 +12.81=61.81 +0.837225=62.647225.

So gamma squared is 62.647225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.647225) = sqrt(1 - 0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.98404). Let's think, 0.992^2 is (0.99)^2=0.9801, plus 0.002^2=0.000004, and cross terms 2*0.99*0.002=0.00396. So 0.99^2 + 2*(0.99)(0.002) + (0.002)^2=0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064. Which is very close to 0.98404. So sqrt(0.98404) is very close to 0.992. So beta≈0.992.

So, decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.915, beta=0.992, so gamma*beta=7.915 *0.992 = approximately 7.86.

So L=7.86 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.86: 2.4e-7 *7.86 = approx 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 m.

So about 1.8864 micrometers. But the options don't have that. The closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, that's about 0.2 micrometers difference. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Another method: Let's compute everything precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41 = exactly equal to 27 ÷ 3.41. Let me compute this exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = approx 0.917.

So gamma is 7.917.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.917=?

Compute 3.41 ×7=23.87.

3.41 ×0.917: 3.41 ×0.9=3.069; 3.41 ×0.017=0.05797. So 3.069+0.05797=3.12697.

Total 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697, which is ≈27. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

Now, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma²))).

gamma² = (7.917)^2.

Compute 7.917^2: 7^2=49. 0.917^2=0.840889. Cross term 2*7*0.917=12.838.

So 49 +12.838=61.838 plus 0.840889=62.678889.

So gamma squared is approximately 62.678889.

So 1/gamma squared is 1/62.678889≈0.015952.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.015952) = sqrt(0.984048). What's the square root of 0.984048?

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064, which is very close.

So beta ≈0.992.

So, gamma * beta =7.917 *0.992 = let's compute that.

7.917 *0.992 = 7.917*(1-0.008) =7.917 - 7.917*0.008=7.917 -0.063336=7.853664.

So, gamma*beta =7.853664.

Now, L = (gamma*beta) * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 seconds.

So,

L=7.853664 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 7.853664:

2.4e-7 m *7.853664 = 18.8487936e-7 m = 1.88487936e-6 m, approximately 1.885e-6 meters.

Hmm, that's about 1.885 micrometers.

The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)

B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)

C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)

D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

So none of the options exactly match 1.885e-6 m, but the closest is option A. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

gamma = E / m = 27 /3.41 = let me compute this precisely.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 313 /341.

Let me compute 313 ÷341.

341 ×0.917 ≈313 (since 313.0 is 341 ×0.917 approx).

Wait, 341 ×0.917 =?

Compute 341 ×0.9 = 306.9, 341 ×0.017=5.797, sum is 312.697. Close to 313. So 0.917 approx.

So gamma is 7.917, as before.

Hmm. So I think my calculation is correct. So the decay length is approximately 1.88e-6 meters. But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's about 10% higher. Why?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included the rest mass correctly. Wait, the energy is given as 27 GeV. Is that the total energy or the kinetic energy? Oh, wait, in particle physics, when they say energy, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass. So E = gamma m c². So I think I did that right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to include the rest mass in the energy. Wait, no, because in high-energy physics, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the lifetime is given as tau_0 =8e-16 s, which is correct for the proper lifetime.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I have to compute the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the fraction of the decays that are observed is the fraction of the decay lengths that are longer than the detector's resolution. So perhaps the problem is about the decay length being longer than the detector's resolution, so that the displacement is detectable. So if the detector's resolution is R, then the fraction of decays observed would be when L > R.

Wait, but the question says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So to have at least 30% of the decays observed, the detector's resolution R must be such that the number of decays with L > R is 30% of total.

Wait, but this might relate to the decay length distribution. The decay length is a function of the proper time, so the distribution of decay lengths is exponential. So the number of decays observed would depend on the detector's ability to resolve a minimum distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The minimum resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure. For the detector to observe a decay, the decay products must be separated by a distance greater than the detector's resolution. So the probability of a decay being observed is the probability that the decay length L is greater than R.

The decay length L has a distribution described by the exponential decay law. The probability that L is greater than R is e^(-R / (c tau_lab)).

Wait, no, wait. The decay length L is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The average decay length is c tau_lab. The probability that L > R is e^(- R / <L> ), where <L> is the mean decay length.

So, in our case, <L> is the average decay length, which is c gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, wait: the average decay length is L_avg = c tau_lab = c gamma tau_0.

So, the probability of a decay occurring at a length greater than R is P(L > R) = e^(- R / L_avg).

We are to find R such that P(L > R) = 30% =0.3.

So,

0.3 = e^(- R/(c gamma tau_0) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides,

ln(0.3) = - R/(c gamma tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1,

- ln(0.3) = R/(c gamma tau_0 )

So,

R = c gamma tau_0 * (- ln(0.3) )

Compute R:

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=7.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s,

-ln(0.3)= approximately 1.20397.

So,

R=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 7.915: 2.4e-7 *7.915 = 1.8996e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.8996e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.287e-6 m.

So R≈2.287e-6 meters, which is 2.287 micrometers.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, but it's a bit less than my result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(0.3)).

Wait, let me re-derive it.

P(L > R) = e^(- R/(c gamma tau_0) ) =0.3.

So,

- R/(c gamma tau_0) = ln(0.3)

So,

R= -c gamma tau_0 ln(0.3) = c gamma tau_0 ln(1/0.3) ≈ c gamma tau_0 *1.20397.

So yes, correct.

So,

R=3e8 m/s *7.915 *8e-16 s *1.20397.

Compute:

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

2.4e-7 *7.915 =1.8996e-6.

1.8996e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.287e-6 m.

So 2.287 micrometers.

But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe a decay. So the minimum R is when the probability P(L > R) is 30%, which would be R= c gamma tau_0 ln(1/0.3) ≈2.287e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, which is about 1.885e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy given is kinetic energy. Did I miss that?

Wait, wait, the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy or kinetic energy? Because if it's kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, that's a possible mistake. Oh no, I think that's where I went wrong.

Yes! If the energy given is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c². So E_kinetic =27 GeV.

Wait, but that would change gamma.

Wait, but the problem says "energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, in particle physics, energy usually refers to the total energy, not just kinetic. But perhaps in this case, it's the kinetic energy. Let me think.

If E is the kinetic energy, then:

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma = (E_kinetic / m c² ) +1.

So,

gamma = (27 GeV /3.41 GeV ) +1 = (27/3.41) +1 ≈7.915 +1=8.915.

Ah! That would change gamma.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. If the energy given is the kinetic energy, then gamma is higher. So let me recalculate gamma.

If E_kinetic =27 GeV, then:

gamma = (27 /3.41) +1 ≈7.915 +1=8.915.

So gamma is 8.915.

Then, L_avg = c gamma tau_0. So L_avg=3e8 m/s *8.915 *8e-16 s.

Compute this.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.915: 2.4e-7 *8.915≈2.14e-6 m, which is 2.14 micrometers.

So the average decay length is about 2.14e-6 m, which is 2.14 micrometers.

But the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, but earlier I thought that the average decay length was 1.88e-6 m, but that was under the assumption that E is the total energy. If E is kinetic, it's different.

So, the confusion is whether the given energy is total or kinetic.

The problem says, "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact terminology, but in high-energy physics, when they specify the energy of a beam or a particle, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or sometimes the total energy. This can be a point of confusion.

Wait, let's re-express gamma in both cases.

If E is total energy:

gamma = E / m =27/3.41≈7.915.

If E is kinetic energy:

gamma = (27/(3.41)) +1 ≈8.915.

So, the decay length depends on gamma, so this changes the outcome.

Earlier calculation, when E was considered as total energy, gave L≈1.88e-6 m.

If E is kinetic, then L≈2.14e-6 m.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close to 2.14e-6, but a bit less.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation with E being kinetic gives a gamma of 8.915.

So let me compute L_avg = c gamma tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=8.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg =3e8 *8.915 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.915: 2.4e-7 *8.915=2.1396e-6 m.

So approximately 2.14e-6 m. That's 2.14 micrometers.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close.

Hmm, perhaps the problem considers E as kinetic energy. So the correct answer would be option A.

But why does the problem say "energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV"? I'm a bit confused about whether that refers to total or kinetic. 

In high-energy physics, the energy of a particle in the lab frame is often the total energy. So perhaps I was correct in the initial approach. But the problem's answer isn't matching either way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, and the 30% is a distractor. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: the proper lifetime is given, and we need to find the mean path length. So the minimum resolution should be the mean path length. So if the detector's resolution is equal to the mean path length, then on average, half the decays would be observed.

But the question says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution must be such that the probability of a decay being observed is 30%. So using the exponential distribution, P(L>R)=30% =0.3.

So,

0.3=exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

So,

R= - c gamma tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, ln(0.3)= -1.20397.

So,

R= c gamma tau_0 * 1.20397.

If E is total energy, gamma=7.915.

So,

R=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

Compute this:

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

2.4e-7 *7.915=1.8996e-6.

1.8996e-6 *1.20397≈2.287e-6 m.

So R≈2.287e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6, which is a bit lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is kinetic, gamma=8.915.

So,

R=3e8 *8.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

2.4e-7 *8.915=2.1396e-6 m.

2.1396e-6 *1.20397≈2.578e-6 m.

So R≈2.578e-6 m. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to calculate the average decay length, which is c gamma tau_0, and the minimum resolution is that.

In that case, for E as total energy, L_avg=1.88e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length without considering beta.

Wait, no, because decay length is L= gamma beta c tau_0. So if I forget about beta, then L=gamma c tau_0.

For gamma=7.915,

L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.915 *24e-8 m.

=1.8996e-6 m.

So 1.8996e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, 2.08 is roughly 1.89 * 1.1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.41 GeV correctly. Oh wait, the mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So when calculating gamma, it's E (in GeV) divided by (m c²) in GeV.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c² (m²/s²), but units get a bit messy. Wait, perhaps I should be careful with units.

Wait, E is given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. m is given in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²).

But in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m. So gamma is E/(m).

So that part is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering only the proper lifetime and not the lab frame. But no, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the mass and the energy. Or maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length. So the average decay length is the most probable, so the detector should have a resolution less than that to observe the decay.

In that case, the average decay length is L_avg = c gamma tau_0.

Which is, as before, 1.88e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore time dilation, which is unlikely, but let's see.

If I don't consider gamma, the lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L= c tau_0 =3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m=240e-9 m=240 nm.

Which is not any of the options except option B, which is 2.08e-9 m. Hmm, not matching. That's way off.

So that can't be.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the average decay length, which is about 1.88e-6 m, but the options have 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is in a different unit. Let me check.

Wait, 27 GeV is correct. 3.41 GeV is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma is done with m being in GeV, but perhaps I should have converted the mass into GeV/c². Wait, no, when computing gamma, the units are in GeV and GeV/c², so gamma = E (GeV) / (m (GeV/c²) c²).

So, E (GeV) = (gamma m c²) GeV.

But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then gamma = E / (m c²) * c² ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should reconsider. Let me write it in proper units.

E = gamma m c².

So, gamma = E/(m c²).

E is given in GeV. m is in GeV/c². c is in m/s.

So,

gamma = (E [GeV]) / ( m [GeV/c²] * c² [m²/s²] )

But that would be (GeV) / ( (GeV/c²) * m²/s² ) )

But that's (GeV) / ( (GeV m²)/(s² c²) ) )

Hmm, unit-wise, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert units into SI units.

Let me compute gamma in SI units.

E =27 GeV =27e9 eV.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So E=27e9 *1.602e-19 J=4.3254e-10 J.

m=3.41 GeV/c².

1 GeV/c²= (1.602e-10 J)/( (3e8 m/s)^2 )=1.602e-10 J/(9e16 m²/s² )=1.78e-27 kg.

So m=3.41 *1.78e-27 kg≈6.06e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) = (4.3254e-10 J) / (6.06e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 )

Compute denominator:

6.06e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² =5.454e-10 kg m²/s².

So,

gamma =4.3254e-10 J /5.454e-10 J ≈0.793.

Wait, wait a minute, that can't be! Gamma can't be less than 1 because the particle is moving.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, which is 27e9 eV. So 27e9 *1.602e-19 J=4.3254e-10 J.

m=3.41 GeV/c². Let me compute m in kg.

1 GeV=1e9 eV=1.602e-10 J.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So 1 GeV/c²= (1.602e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) )= 1.78e-27 kg.

So m=3.41 *1.78e-27 kg≈6.06e-27 kg.

So,

m c² =6.06e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s²=5.454e-10 J.

So,

gamma=E/(m c²)=4.3254e-10 J /5.454e-10 J≈0.793.

Wait, that can't be right because gamma should be greater than 1 for a moving particle.

Wait, this suggests that the energy is less than the rest mass energy, which is impossible because the particle can't have an energy less than its rest mass.

Hmm, that's a problem. So that suggests that I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, wait! The energy E is 27 GeV. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 3.41 GeV.

So, if E is 27 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, then gamma should be greater than 1.

But in my calculation, I got gamma=0.793, which is less than one. That can't be correct, meaning I messed up the unit conversion somewhere.

Let me try again.

E = gamma m c².

So,

gamma = E / (m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈7.915.

Because when you have E in GeV and m c² in GeV, the units cancel.

Wait, because m c² is 3.41 GeV. So,

gamma=27 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.915 as before.

So, I think the initial approach was correct.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation when considering SI units, but the natural unit approach is correct.

So, perhaps the confusion arises because in natural units, the calculation is straightforward.

So, back to the problem. The decay length is about 2.14 micrometers when E is kinetic, and 1.88 when E is total.

But the options don't match.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 cm/s instead of m/s. That would change everything.

Wait, c=3e8 m/s =3e10 cm/s.

Wait, let me compute L again with c=3e10 cm/s.

Wait, that would give L in cm.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in any case, the options are given in meters, so I think the confusion is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c=3e8 cm/s. Let me compute again, but I don't think that changes anything because the units would be in cm, but the options are in meters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the decay length as gamma c tau_0, without considering beta. So using gamma=7.915, L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.915*24e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is very close.

But why the discrepancy? Perhaps the given options have a typo, or maybe the values were rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma as E/m, where E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c², and then compute L=gamma c tau_0.

So, gamma=27/3.41=7.915.

L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.915 *24e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m.

So 1.9e-6 m. The option is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the calculation used gamma=8.915 (assuming E is kinetic energy), leading to L≈2.14e-6 m, which is close to option A.

So, given the options, perhaps option A is the intended correct answer.

To determine the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^-$, we start by calculating the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of $X^0$ is $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$, and the energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$. The mass of $X^0$ is $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$. 

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
The Lorentz factor is given by $\gamma = \frac{E}{m}$. Substituting the values:
\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the decay length in the lab frame
The decay length in the lab frame is given by:
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]
where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ and $\beta \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}$. For $\gamma = 7.915$, we compute:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.915)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01596} \approx 0.992
\]
Thus:
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = 7.915 \cdot 0.992 \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s})
\]
First, calculate $c \tau_0$:
\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]
Now, multiply by $\gamma \beta$:
\[
L = 7.915 \cdot 0.992 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.8996 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]
Thus, the average decay length is approximately $L \approx 1.90 \, \mu\text{m}$.

### Step 3: Adjust for the 30% observation threshold
The problem specifies that the detector must observe at least 30% of the decays. This corresponds to the minimum resolution $R$ such that the probability of detecting a decay $P(L > R) = 0.3$. For an exponential distribution of decay lengths, the probability is:
\[
P(L > R) = e^{-R / \langle L \rangle}
\]
where $\langle L \rangle = c \gamma \tau_0$ is the mean decay length. Setting $P(L > R) = 0.3$, we solve for $R$:
\[
0.3 = e^{-R / \langle L \rangle} \implies \ln(0.3) = -\frac{R}{\langle L \rangle} \implies R = -\langle L \rangle \ln(0.3)
\]
Using $\ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397$, we find:
\[
R = \langle L \rangle \cdot 1.20397
\]
Substitute $\langle L \rangle = 1.90 \, \mu\text{m}$:
\[
R = 1.90 \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.287 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.287 \, \mu\text{m}$. Among the given options, the closest value is **Option A: $2.08 \, \mu\text{m}$**. This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀, which is 8e-16 seconds. I remember proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. The problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, it's the lifetime measured when the particle is at rest. But in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. So I need to calculate the lifetime in the lab frame first.

Time dilation formula is gamma times tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but since the units here are in GeV and GeV/c², I need to be careful. Wait, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. Oh wait, no, X⁰ is at rest? No, wait, no. Wait, the particle X⁰ is moving in the lab frame because it's in the Bubble Chamber, which is the lab frame. So X⁰ is moving, hence its lifetime is longer.

So gamma is E/(m c²), but in natural units where c=1, E in GeV and m also in GeV/c², so E/(m c²) becomes E/(m) when c=1. Wait, actually, in natural units, c is 1, so E = gamma m, so gamma = E / m. So for X⁰, gamma would be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 * 8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 3.41 * 8 is approximately 27.28, so 27 is a bit less than 8 times. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so tau ≈ 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, what's the point of the lifetime? Oh, right, the lifetime determines the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the average path length is v * tau. Wait, but maybe the speed is approximately c? Because particles moving at high energies are close to the speed of light. So v ≈ c.

So the average path length L = v * tau ≈ c * tau. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Wait, 3e8 times 6e-15 is (3 *6) =18, and 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. So 18e-7 meters, which is 1.8e-6 meters. Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately. 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = 3 *6.328 = 18.984, and 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7, so 18.984e-7 meters. 18.984e-7 is 1.8984e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So I think the idea is that the resolution of the detector needs to be good enough to distinguish the decay vertices that are a certain distance apart. But wait, if the particle's path length is L, then in the detector, you can see the decay if the two decay products are within the resolution. But I'm not exactly sure how the 30% comes into play.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of decays observed. If the decay length is L, the probability of observing the decay is when the path length is such that the detector can resolve it. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the minimum distance that the decay products travel so that the detector can register a vertex displacement, and hence the decay is observed. So the fraction of decays observed depends on whether the decay occurs within the detector's volume, or perhaps whether the path is long enough to be detected.

Wait, another approach: the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, beta is v/c. But in the earlier calculation, I assumed v≈c, so beta≈1. So the decay length L is about gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution required so that the detector can resolve the decay products' tracks. So, if the decay occurs, the particles Y and Z will leave tracks. The longer the decay length, the further apart the decay products' tracks are. So the detector must have a resolution (finest detail it can see) less than the decay length.

But wait, the question says, "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Hmm. So perhaps, if the decay length is longer than the detector's resolution, you can observe the decay. So the fraction observed would be 30%. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimum path length such that 30% of the decays are observed. Wait, but how does the resolution relate to the number of decays observed? Oh, perhaps if the resolution is better (smaller), you can see more decays because you can distinguish the decay vertex more clearly. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper way to compute the decay length, and then the resolution must be smaller than that length to detect the decay. So the minimum resolution is the decay length divided by a certain factor. Hmm.

Wait, but I think the key here is to compute the decay length and then use that as the required resolution. So the minimum resolution needed would be the decay length L. Because if the detector's resolution is less than L, it can resolve the decay.

Wait, let me think again. The decay length L is how far the X⁰ travels before decaying. The Bubble Chamber can detect the decay if the particles Y and Z leave tracks that are separated by a distance that the chamber can resolve. So the resolution must be at least on the order of the decay length. Wait no, actually, the better the resolution (smaller the minimum detectable distance), the more decays you can observe because you can see the decay vertex more clearly. So to observe a certain percentage of the decays, you need a certain minimal resolution.

Wait, alternatively, the problem might be asking for the minimum resolution that allows detection, which is when the decay length is just detectable. But I'm not entirely clear on how the 30% comes into play. Oh wait, perhaps 30% of the possible path length, or that the decay is observed in 30% of the cases? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the number 30% refers to the fraction of the possible decay length that the detector must resolve. So, the decay length is L, and the detector's resolution must be such that it can detect a displacement of at least 30% of L. Hmm, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the proper calculation of the decay length, and the minimum resolution is just the decay length itself. Because if the detector's resolution is equal to the decay length, you can just barely detect the decay. So, perhaps the answer is the decay length.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L as approximately 1.9e-6 meters, which is 1.9 micrometers. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. So that would fit. But why 30%? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

Gamma is E/m. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 7.915 *8e-16. Let's compute this: 7.915 *8 is approximately 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s, which is 6.332e-15 seconds.

Then, L = c * tau_lab. c is 3e8 m/s, so:

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.332e-15 s = 3 *6.332e-7 m = 1.8996e-6 m, which is about 1.90e-6 meters or 1.9 micrometers.

So the decay length is approximately 1.9 micrometers. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 meters, which is close to 2 micrometers. Hmm. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to compute beta and then include that in the decay length formula. Wait, decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Earlier I assumed beta ≈ 1, but perhaps X⁰ is not moving at exactly the speed of light.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So the total energy E is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E=gamma m.

So beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma using the relation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute beta.

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.915)^2)).

Compute 7.915 squared: 7.915^2 = approximately (7.9)^2 = 62.41. But more accurately, (7.915)^2 = (7.9)^2 + 2*(7.9)*(0.015) + (0.015)^2. 7.9^2 is 62.41. 2*7.9*0.015 = 0.237. 0.015^2=0.000225. So total 62.41 + 0.237 +0.000225 ≈62.6472.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.6472) = sqrt(1 - 0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is approximately 0.992.

So, the decay length should be L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So let me compute that.

gamma=7.915, beta=0.992.

gamma*beta ≈7.915 *0.992 ≈7.86.

So L =7.86 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L≈7.86 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.86: 2.4e-7 *7.86=18.864e-7 m=1.8864e-6 m.

So approximately 1.8864e-6 meters, which is 1.8864 micrometers.

Hmm, but none of the options is exactly this. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

gamma =27 /3.41. Let me compute 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *8=27.28. 27 is between 7*3.41 and 8*3.41. So 27/3.41 = approximately 7.915.

Alternatively, 3.41 *7.915 = let me compute 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41 *0.915= approx 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.015=0.05115. So 3.069 +0.05115=3.12015. So total 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015. So 3.41 *7.915≈26.99, which is just about 27. So gamma is indeed 7.915.

Calculating beta again: gamma is 7.915, so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.915)^2)).

7.915^2 is 7.915*7.915.

Let me compute it more accurately.

7.915 *7.915 = (7 +0.915)^2 = 49 + 2*7*0.915 + (0.915)^2.

Compute each term:

49 is 49.

2*7*0.915=14 *0.915=12.81.

(0.915)^2 = approx 0.837225.

So sum is 49 +12.81=61.81 +0.837225=62.647225.

So gamma squared is 62.647225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.647225) = sqrt(1 - 0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.98404). Let's think, 0.992^2 is (0.99)^2=0.9801, plus 0.002^2=0.000004, and cross terms 2*0.99*0.002=0.00396. So 0.99^2 + 2*(0.99)(0.002) + (0.002)^2=0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064. Which is very close to 0.98404. So sqrt(0.98404) is very close to 0.992. So beta≈0.992.

So, decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.915, beta=0.992, so gamma*beta=7.915 *0.992 = approximately 7.86.

So L=7.86 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.86: 2.4e-7 *7.86 = approx 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 m.

So about 1.8864 micrometers. But the options don't have that. The closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, that's about 0.2 micrometers difference. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Another method: Let's compute everything precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41 = exactly equal to 27 ÷ 3.41. Let me compute this exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = approx 0.917.

So gamma is 7.917.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.917=?

Compute 3.41 ×7=23.87.

3.41 ×0.917: 3.41 ×0.9=3.069; 3.41 ×0.017=0.05797. So 3.069+0.05797=3.12697.

Total 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697, which is ≈27. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

Now, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma²))).

gamma² = (7.917)^2.

Compute 7.917^2: 7^2=49. 0.917^2=0.840889. Cross term 2*7*0.917=12.838.

So 49 +12.838=61.838 plus 0.840889=62.678889.

So gamma squared is approximately 62.678889.

So 1/gamma squared is 1/62.678889≈0.015952.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.015952) = sqrt(0.984048). What's the square root of 0.984048?

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064, which is very close.

So beta ≈0.992.

So, gamma * beta =7.917 *0.992 = let's compute that.

7.917 *0.992 = 7.917*(1-0.008) =7.917 - 7.917*0.008=7.917 -0.063336=7.853664.

So, gamma*beta =7.853664.

Now, L = (gamma*beta) * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 seconds.

So,

L=7.853664 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 7.853664:

2.4e-7 m *7.853664 = 18.8487936e-7 m = 1.88487936e-6 m, approximately 1.885e-6 meters.

Hmm, that's about 1.885 micrometers.

The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)

B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)

C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)

D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

So none of the options exactly match 1.885e-6 m, but the closest is option A. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

gamma = E / m = 27 /3.41 = let me compute this precisely.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 313 /341.

Let me compute 313 ÷341.

341 ×0.917 ≈313 (since 313.0 is 341 ×0.917 approx).

Wait, 341 ×0.917 =?

Compute 341 ×0.9 = 306.9, 341 ×0.017=5.797, sum is 312.697. Close to 313. So 0.917 approx.

So gamma is 7.917, as before.

Hmm. So I think my calculation is correct. So the decay length is approximately 1.88e-6 meters. But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's about 10% higher. Why?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included the rest mass correctly. Wait, the energy is given as 27 GeV. Is that the total energy or the kinetic energy? Oh, wait, in particle physics, when they say energy, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass. So E = gamma m c². So I think I did that right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to include the rest mass in the energy. Wait, no, because in high-energy physics, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the lifetime is given as tau_0 =8e-16 s, which is correct for the proper lifetime.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I have to compute the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the fraction of the decays that are observed is the fraction of the decay lengths that are longer than the detector's resolution. So perhaps the problem is about the decay length being longer than the detector's resolution, so that the displacement is detectable. So if the detector's resolution is R, then the fraction of decays observed would be when L > R.

Wait, but the question says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So to have at least 30% of the decays observed, the detector's resolution R must be such that the number of decays with L > R is 30% of total.

Wait, but this might relate to the decay length distribution. The decay length is a function of the proper time, so the distribution of decay lengths is exponential. So the number of decays observed would depend on the detector's ability to resolve a minimum distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The minimum resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure. For the detector to observe a decay, the decay products must be separated by a distance greater than the detector's resolution. So the probability of a decay being observed is the probability that the decay length L is greater than R.

The decay length L has a distribution described by the exponential decay law. The probability that L is greater than R is e^(-R / (c tau_lab)).

Wait, no, wait. The decay length L is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The average decay length is c tau_lab. The probability that L > R is e^(- R / <L> ), where <L> is the mean decay length.

So, in our case, <L> is the average decay length, which is c gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, wait: the average decay length is L_avg = c tau_lab = c gamma tau_0.

So, the probability of a decay occurring at a length greater than R is P(L > R) = e^(- R / L_avg).

We are to find R such that P(L > R) = 30% =0.3.

So,

0.3 = e^(- R/(c gamma tau_0) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides,

ln(0.3) = - R/(c gamma tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1,

- ln(0.3) = R/(c gamma tau_0 )

So,

R = c gamma tau_0 * (- ln(0.3) )

Compute R:

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=7.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s,

-ln(0.3)= approximately 1.20397.

So,

R=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 7.915: 2.4e-7 *7.915 = 1.8996e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.8996e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.287e-6 m.

So R≈2.287e-6 meters, which is 2.287 micrometers.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, but it's a bit less than my result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(0.3)).

Wait, let me re-derive it.

P(L > R) = e^(- R/(c gamma tau_0) ) =0.3.

So,

- R/(c gamma tau_0) = ln(0.3)

So,

R= -c gamma tau_0 ln(0.3) = c gamma tau_0 ln(1/0.3) ≈ c gamma tau_0 *1.20397.

So yes, correct.

So,

R=3e8 m/s *7.915 *8e-16 s *1.20397.

Compute:

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

2.4e-7 *7.915 =1.8996e-6.

1.8996e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.287e-6 m.

So 2.287 micrometers.

But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe a decay. So the minimum R is when the probability P(L > R) is 30%, which would be R= c gamma tau_0 ln(1/0.3) ≈2.287e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, which is about 1.885e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy given is kinetic energy. Did I miss that?

Wait, wait, the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy or kinetic energy? Because if it's kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, that's a possible mistake. Oh no, I think that's where I went wrong.

Yes! If the energy given is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c². So E_kinetic =27 GeV.

Wait, but that would change gamma.

Wait, but the problem says "energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, in particle physics, energy usually refers to the total energy, not just kinetic. But perhaps in this case, it's the kinetic energy. Let me think.

If E is the kinetic energy, then:

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma = (E_kinetic / m c² ) +1.

So,

gamma = (27 GeV /3.41 GeV ) +1 = (27/3.41) +1 ≈7.915 +1=8.915.

Ah! That would change gamma.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. If the energy given is the kinetic energy, then gamma is higher. So let me recalculate gamma.

If E_kinetic =27 GeV, then:

gamma = (27 /3.41) +1 ≈7.915 +1=8.915.

So gamma is 8.915.

Then, L_avg = c gamma tau_0. So L_avg=3e8 m/s *8.915 *8e-16 s.

Compute this.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.915: 2.4e-7 *8.915≈2.14e-6 m, which is 2.14 micrometers.

So the average decay length is about 2.14e-6 m, which is 2.14 micrometers.

But the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, but earlier I thought that the average decay length was 1.88e-6 m, but that was under the assumption that E is the total energy. If E is kinetic, it's different.

So, the confusion is whether the given energy is total or kinetic.

The problem says, "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact terminology, but in high-energy physics, when they specify the energy of a beam or a particle, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or sometimes the total energy. This can be a point of confusion.

Wait, let's re-express gamma in both cases.

If E is total energy:

gamma = E / m =27/3.41≈7.915.

If E is kinetic energy:

gamma = (27/(3.41)) +1 ≈8.915.

So, the decay length depends on gamma, so this changes the outcome.

Earlier calculation, when E was considered as total energy, gave L≈1.88e-6 m.

If E is kinetic, then L≈2.14e-6 m.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close to 2.14e-6, but a bit less.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation with E being kinetic gives a gamma of 8.915.

So let me compute L_avg = c gamma tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=8.915,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg =3e8 *8.915 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.915: 2.4e-7 *8.915=2.1396e-6 m.

So approximately 2.14e-6 m. That's 2.14 micrometers.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close.

Hmm, perhaps the problem considers E as kinetic energy. So the correct answer would be option A.

But why does the problem say "energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV"? I'm a bit confused about whether that refers to total or kinetic. 

In high-energy physics, the energy of a particle in the lab frame is often the total energy. So perhaps I was correct in the initial approach. But the problem's answer isn't matching either way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, and the 30% is a distractor. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: the proper lifetime is given, and we need to find the mean path length. So the minimum resolution should be the mean path length. So if the detector's resolution is equal to the mean path length, then on average, half the decays would be observed.

But the question says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution must be such that the probability of a decay being observed is 30%. So using the exponential distribution, P(L>R)=30% =0.3.

So,

0.3=exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

So,

R= - c gamma tau_0 ln(0.3).

Wait, ln(0.3)= -1.20397.

So,

R= c gamma tau_0 * 1.20397.

If E is total energy, gamma=7.915.

So,

R=3e8 *7.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

Compute this:

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

2.4e-7 *7.915=1.8996e-6.

1.8996e-6 *1.20397≈2.287e-6 m.

So R≈2.287e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6, which is a bit lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is kinetic, gamma=8.915.

So,

R=3e8 *8.915 *8e-16 *1.20397.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

2.4e-7 *8.915=2.1396e-6 m.

2.1396e-6 *1.20397≈2.578e-6 m.

So R≈2.578e-6 m. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to calculate the average decay length, which is c gamma tau_0, and the minimum resolution is that.

In that case, for E as total energy, L_avg=1.88e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length without considering beta.

Wait, no, because decay length is L= gamma beta c tau_0. So if I forget about beta, then L=gamma c tau_0.

For gamma=7.915,

L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.915 *24e-8 m.

=1.8996e-6 m.

So 1.8996e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, 2.08 is roughly 1.89 * 1.1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.41 GeV correctly. Oh wait, the mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So when calculating gamma, it's E (in GeV) divided by (m c²) in GeV.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c² (m²/s²), but units get a bit messy. Wait, perhaps I should be careful with units.

Wait, E is given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. m is given in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²).

But in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m. So gamma is E/(m).

So that part is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering only the proper lifetime and not the lab frame. But no, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the mass and the energy. Or maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length. So the average decay length is the most probable, so the detector should have a resolution less than that to observe the decay.

In that case, the average decay length is L_avg = c gamma tau_0.

Which is, as before, 1.88e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore time dilation, which is unlikely, but let's see.

If I don't consider gamma, the lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L= c tau_0 =3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m=240e-9 m=240 nm.

Which is not any of the options except option B, which is 2.08e-9 m. Hmm, not matching. That's way off.

So that can't be.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the average decay length, which is about 1.88e-6 m, but the options have 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is in a different unit. Let me check.

Wait, 27 GeV is correct. 3.41 GeV is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma is done with m being in GeV, but perhaps I should have converted the mass into GeV/c². Wait, no, when computing gamma, the units are in GeV and GeV/c², so gamma = E (GeV) / (m (GeV/c²) c²).

So, E (GeV) = (gamma m c²) GeV.

But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then gamma = E / (m c²) * c² ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should reconsider. Let me write it in proper units.

E = gamma m c².

So, gamma = E/(m c²).

E is given in GeV. m is in GeV/c². c is in m/s.

So,

gamma = (E [GeV]) / ( m [GeV/c²] * c² [m²/s²] )

But that would be (GeV) / ( (GeV/c²) * m²/s² ) )

But that's (GeV) / ( (GeV m²)/(s² c²) ) )

Hmm, unit-wise, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert units into SI units.

Let me compute gamma in SI units.

E =27 GeV =27e9 eV.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So E=27e9 *1.602e-19 J=4.3254e-10 J.

m=3.41 GeV/c².

1 GeV/c²= (1.602e-10 J)/( (3e8 m/s)^2 )=1.602e-10 J/(9e16 m²/s² )=1.78e-27 kg.

So m=3.41 *1.78e-27 kg≈6.06e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) = (4.3254e-10 J) / (6.06e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 )

Compute denominator:

6.06e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² =5.454e-10 kg m²/s².

So,

gamma =4.3254e-10 J /5.454e-10 J ≈0.793.

Wait, wait a minute, that can't be! Gamma can't be less than 1 because the particle is moving.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, which is 27e9 eV. So 27e9 *1.602e-19 J=4.3254e-10 J.

m=3.41 GeV/c². Let me compute m in kg.

1 GeV=1e9 eV=1.602e-10 J.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So 1 GeV/c²= (1.602e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) )= 1.78e-27 kg.

So m=3.41 *1.78e-27 kg≈6.06e-27 kg.

So,

m c² =6.06e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s²=5.454e-10 J.

So,

gamma=E/(m c²)=4.3254e-10 J /5.454e-10 J≈0.793.

Wait, that can't be right because gamma should be greater than 1 for a moving particle.

Wait, this suggests that the energy is less than the rest mass energy, which is impossible because the particle can't have an energy less than its rest mass.

Hmm, that's a problem. So that suggests that I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, wait! The energy E is 27 GeV. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 3.41 GeV.

So, if E is 27 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, then gamma should be greater than 1.

But in my calculation, I got gamma=0.793, which is less than one. That can't be correct, meaning I messed up the unit conversion somewhere.

Let me try again.

E = gamma m c².

So,

gamma = E / (m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈7.915.

Because when you have E in GeV and m c² in GeV, the units cancel.

Wait, because m c² is 3.41 GeV. So,

gamma=27 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.915 as before.

So, I think the initial approach was correct.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation when considering SI units, but the natural unit approach is correct.

So, perhaps the confusion arises because in natural units, the calculation is straightforward.

So, back to the problem. The decay length is about 2.14 micrometers when E is kinetic, and 1.88 when E is total.

But the options don't match.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 cm/s instead of m/s. That would change everything.

Wait, c=3e8 m/s =3e10 cm/s.

Wait, let me compute L again with c=3e10 cm/s.

Wait, that would give L in cm.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in any case, the options are given in meters, so I think the confusion is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c=3e8 cm/s. Let me compute again, but I don't think that changes anything because the units would be in cm, but the options are in meters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the decay length as gamma c tau_0, without considering beta. So using gamma=7.915, L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.915*24e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is very close.

But why the discrepancy? Perhaps the given options have a typo, or maybe the values were rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma as E/m, where E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c², and then compute L=gamma c tau_0.

So, gamma=27/3.41=7.915.

L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.915 *24e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m.

So 1.9e-6 m. The option is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the calculation used gamma=8.915 (assuming E is kinetic energy), leading to L≈2.14e-6 m, which is close to option A.

So, given the options, perhaps option A is the intended correct answer.


To determine the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^-$, we start by calculating the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of $X^0$ is $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$, and the energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$. The mass of $X^0$ is $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$. 

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
The Lorentz factor is given by $\gamma = \frac{E}{m}$. Substituting the values:
\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the decay length in the lab frame
The decay length in the lab frame is given by:
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]
where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ and $\beta \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}$. For $\gamma = 7.915$, we compute:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.915)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01596} \approx 0.992
\]
Thus:
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = 7.915 \cdot 0.992 \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s})
\]
First, calculate $c \tau_0$:
\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]
Now, multiply by $\gamma \beta$:
\[
L = 7.915 \cdot 0.992 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.8996 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]
Thus, the average decay length is approximately $L \approx 1.90 \, \mu\text{m}$.

### Step 3: Adjust for the 30% observation threshold
The problem specifies that the detector must observe at least 30% of the decays. This corresponds to the minimum resolution $R$ such that the probability of detecting a decay $P(L > R) = 0.3$. For an exponential distribution of decay lengths, the probability is:
\[
P(L > R) = e^{-R / \langle L \rangle}
\]
where $\langle L \rangle = c \gamma \tau_0$ is the mean decay length. Setting $P(L > R) = 0.3$, we solve for $R$:
\[
0.3 = e^{-R / \langle L \rangle} \implies \ln(0.3) = -\frac{R}{\langle L \rangle} \implies R = -\langle L \rangle \ln(0.3)
\]
Using $\ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397$, we find:
\[
R = \langle L \rangle \cdot 1.20397
\]
Substitute $\langle L \rangle = 1.90 \, \mu\text{m}$:
\[
R = 1.90 \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.287 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.287 \, \mu\text{m}$. Among the given options, the closest value is **Option A: $2.08 \, \mu\text{m}$**. This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
**Answer: A**
