Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read through it carefully again.

So, the setup is: an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay, I need to think about what I remember about particle physics and photon emission during annihilation.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons. But since both the electron and positron are moving, their combined momentum must be considered. Also, the conservation laws—momentum and energy—apply here.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So, their energies are equal. Let me think about the conservation of momentum and energy here.

The initial situation is that both the electron and positron are moving along the same horizontal axis but in opposite directions. So, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me calculate their momenta before collision.

The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is given for each. The electron has gamma_e =4 and the positron gamma_p=2. The rest mass of an electron is m_e, so the same for the positron.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way to express it is p = gamma * m_e * c^2 / c, because v = (momentum*c^2)/(energy). Alternatively, p = gamma m_e v, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so alternatively, p can be written as (gamma m_e) v. But another approach is to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e.

Wait, alternatively, since both are moving along the same line, their momenta are opposite in direction. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's say the electron is moving to the right (from left), so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its velocity is negative.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But wait, since they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities have opposite signs.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute their momenta using the relation between momentum and Lorentz factor. Because gamma is given, and for each particle, the momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and beta is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Alternatively, another formula: the momentum p = gamma m_e v. But v can be written as beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the relation that p = gamma m_e v. But perhaps using beta and gamma, another approach is to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and beta. Because beta = v/c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but I think a better approach is to calculate the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e. Let me remember that for a particle, the total energy is E = gamma m_e c^2, and the momentum is p = gamma m_e v. But v = beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c. Also, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), we can write beta as sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Hmm, let me compute the momentum for each.

So, for the electron: gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

So p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Wait, wait, let's do this more accurately. Let me compute the momentum for each particle.

Electron:
gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

Substituting beta_e: p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p=2.

beta_p = sqrt(1 -1/(2^2)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m_e * sqrt(3) * c.

Wait, but the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction. So the total initial momentum is the sum of these two, but considering their directions.

So the electron's momentum is positive (to the right), and the positron's is negative (to the left), so their momenta are in opposite directions.

So initial total momentum: p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction. So when adding vectors, the positron's momentum is negative.

Wait, let me think about the directions again. The electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative.

So for the positron, its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p, but since p_p is negative, it's p_e - |p_p|.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Electron's momentum: p_e = 4 * m_e * beta_e * c (since beta_e is positive, direction is right).

Positron's momentum: p_p = 2 * m_e * beta_p * c, but since it's moving left, its velocity is -beta_p c, so its momentum is -2 m_e beta_p c.

Wait, no, wait: Momentum is a vector. So electron's p = +gamma m_e beta c, positron's p is -gamma m_e beta c.

So the total initial momentum is:

p_initial = (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + (gamma_p m_e beta_p c) * (-1) 

Because the positron's direction is opposite.

So substituting:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4, gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2.

So,

p_initial = (4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c) - (2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c )

Simplify each term:

4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) = m_e * sqrt(15).

2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) = m_e * sqrt(3).

So,

p_initial = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) c.

Hmm, okay, so the initial total momentum is in the positive direction (to the right) because sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3.872 - 1.732 ≈2.14, so positive.

So, after annihilation, two photons are produced, and their momenta must sum to this initial momentum.

But wait, photons are massless and their momentum is in the direction of propagation. Also, the energy of a photon is E = pc, since for photons, E^2 = (pc)^2 c^2 (since m=0, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → E=pc for photons).

So each photon has energy E1 = pc, and E2 = pc. Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy, so E1 = E2.

But the problem also states that their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right. So the two photons are moving in the right direction but above and below the horizontal. So their angles from the horizontal are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, perhaps. Let's think about their directions.

Let me imagine the coordinate system, horizontal being the x-axis, and vertical the y-axis. The upper-right direction implies the photon is moving at some positive angle θ from the x-axis. The lower-right direction would be at an angle of -θ, but since the angle between the two photons would be 2θ.

But wait, perhaps one is at an angle θ above the x-axis, and the other is θ below, so the angle between them is 2θ. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps the angle between them is 180 - 2θ, but I'll have to work that out.

Now, since the two photons must conserve momentum, their momenta vectors must add up to the initial momentum. So let me model this.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: direction at angle θ above the x-axis, momentum p1.

Photon 2: direction at angle -θ below the x-axis, momentum p2.

But wait, the problem says one is upper-right and another lower-right. I think they could be symmetric about the x-axis. So perhaps their angles from the x-axis are θ and -θ. But the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. Since E = pc, and their energies are same, then their magnitudes of momentum are same: p1 = p2 = p.

So each photon has momentum p, but in directions symmetric about the x-axis.

So the total momentum after the collision is the sum of the two momentum vectors of the photons.

So the total momentum is:

p_total = p1 + p2.

But since p1 and p2 are vectors, let's break them into x and y components.

p1_x = p * cosθ

p1_y = p * sinθ

p2_x = p * cos(-θ) = p cosθ

p2_y = p * sin(-θ) = -p sinθ

So adding them together:

p_total_x = p cosθ + p cosθ = 2 p cosθ

p_total_y = p sinθ - p sinθ = 0.

So the total momentum after the collision is (2 p cosθ) in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.

But the initial total momentum was p_initial = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c in the x-direction.

So, according to conservation of momentum, the total momentum after must equal the initial.

So:

2 p cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

And since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, the y-components must cancel out, which they do because p_total_y is zero.

Now, the energy part: total energy before collision must equal the total energy after.

The initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each of their energies is E = gamma m_e c^2.

So, electron's energy E_e = 4 m_e c^2.

Positron's energy E_p = 2 m_e c^2.

Total initial energy E_initial = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

The total energy after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' energies: E1 + E2.

But the problem states that E1 = E2 = E_photon.

So E_photon = E1 = E2.

Each photon's energy is E_photon = p c, since for a photon E = pc.

So total energy after is 2 p c.

Conservation of energy gives:

2 p c = 6 m_e c^2.

Dividing both sides by c:

2 p =6 m_e c.

So p = 3 m_e c.

Wait, that's interesting. So each photon's momentum is p =3 m_e c.

Wait, but earlier we had 2 p cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

So substituting p =3 m_e c into that equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

Simplify:

6 m_e c cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Hmm, let me compute that.

Compute sqrt(15): approx 3.872.

sqrt(3): approx 1.732.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.140.

Divide by 6: 2.140 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So cosθ ≈ 0.3567.

θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ about 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420, so 0.3567 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator: arccos(0.3567). Well, let's compute it.

I can compute using a calculator: 0.3567 → theta ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact angle. But maybe I can proceed without the exact value.

Now, the question is, what is the angle between the two photons' directions.

Each photon is moving at angles θ and -θ from the x-axis. So the angle between the two photons is 2θ.

Wait, no. Because one is at +θ and the other at -θ. So the angle between them is 2θ. Because the angle between the two vectors is θ - (-θ) = 2θ.

So if θ is about 69 degrees, then 2θ is about 138 degrees.

Looking back at the options, option C is 138 degrees, and option B is 172, which is close to 180, perhaps the supplement.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck: when you have two angles θ above the x-axis and θ below, the angle between them would be 180 - 2θ? Or 2θ?

Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. Imagine photon1 is at θ above x-axis, photon2 is at θ below. The angle between them is the angle between photon1 and photon2, which is θ (from x-axis) above and θ below. So the total angle between them is 2θ.

Wait, for example, if θ is 30 degrees, then the angle between the two photons would be 60 degrees.

So in our case, θ is approximately 69 degrees, so the angle between them would be approximately 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Earlier, I thought that the angle between the two photons is 2θ, but the problem states that one is moving in the upper-right and another in the lower-right direction. So the angle between them is the angle each makes with the x-axis, and then the total angle between them is the sum of those.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the angles each photon makes with the x-axis and the angle between them.

Another approach: the two photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction. So their directions form a 'V' shape opening to the right. The angle between them would be the angle between their two direction vectors.

So, if each photon is at θ above and below the x-axis, the angle between them is 2θ.

Thus, if θ is approximately 69 degrees, the angle between them is about 138 degrees, which is option C.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculation of cosθ.

Earlier, I had:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(15) ≈3.872983346
sqrt(3)≈1.732050808

So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) = 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 ≈0.3568220897.

So cosθ = 0.35682209.

What is θ? Let's compute arccos(0.35682209).

Using a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is about 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(65 degrees) is approx 0.4226, cos(70) ≈ 0.3420.

Wait, wait, wait, 0.3568 is between cos(69) and cos(70), perhaps closer to 69. So perhaps 69 degrees.

So 2θ would be 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of momentum and energy principles.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors \( \gamma_e = 4 \) and \( \gamma_p = 2 \), respectively. Their velocities are \( v_e = \beta_e c \) and \( v_p = \beta_p c \), where \( \beta = v/c \). Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \), we calculate:

- For the electron:  
  \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/4^2} = \sqrt{15/16} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682 \).  
  Momentum:  
  \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e (\sqrt{15}/4) c = m_e \sqrt{15} c \).

- For the positron:  
  \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/2^2} = \sqrt{3/4} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660 \).  
  Momentum:  
  \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e (\sqrt{3}/2) c = m_e \sqrt{3} c \).

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

### Step 2: Final Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \) and momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c \). The photons move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the horizontal. Their momentum components are:

- Photon 1 (upper-right):  
  \( p_{1x} = p \cos\theta, \, p_{1y} = p \sin\theta \).

- Photon 2 (lower-right):  
  \( p_{2x} = p \cos\theta, \, p_{2y} = -p \sin\theta \).

The total momentum after annihilation is:  
\[
p_{\text{final}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x}, \, p_{1y} + p_{2y} = (2p \cos\theta, 0).
\]

By conservation of momentum, \( p_{\text{final}} = p_{\text{initial}} \), so:  
\[
2p \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

### Step 3: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies:  
\[
E_{\text{final}} = 2 E_{\text{photon}}.
\]

By conservation of energy:  
\[
2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

Since \( E_{\text{photon}} = p_{\text{photon}} c \), we find:  
\[
p = 3 m_e c.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta \)
Substitute \( p = 3 m_e c \) into \( 2p \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c \):  
\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

Simplify:  
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

Calculate \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):  
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]

Thus:  
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between Photons
The photons are symmetrically placed at \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:  
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read through it carefully again.

So, the setup is: an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay, I need to think about what I remember about particle physics and photon emission during annihilation.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons. But since both the electron and positron are moving, their combined momentum must be considered. Also, the conservation laws—momentum and energy—apply here.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So, their energies are equal. Let me think about the conservation of momentum and energy here.

The initial situation is that both the electron and positron are moving along the same horizontal axis but in opposite directions. So, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me calculate their momenta before collision.

The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is given for each. The electron has gamma_e =4 and the positron gamma_p=2. The rest mass of an electron is m_e, so the same for the positron.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way to express it is p = gamma * m_e * c^2 / c, because v = (momentum*c^2)/(energy). Alternatively, p = gamma m_e v, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so alternatively, p can be written as (gamma m_e) v. But another approach is to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e.

Wait, alternatively, since both are moving along the same line, their momenta are opposite in direction. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's say the electron is moving to the right (from left), so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its velocity is negative.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But wait, since they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities have opposite signs.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute their momenta using the relation between momentum and Lorentz factor. Because gamma is given, and for each particle, the momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and beta is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Alternatively, another formula: the momentum p = gamma m_e v. But v can be written as beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the relation that p = gamma m_e v. But perhaps using beta and gamma, another approach is to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and beta. Because beta = v/c, so p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but I think a better approach is to calculate the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e. Let me remember that for a particle, the total energy is E = gamma m_e c^2, and the momentum is p = gamma m_e v. But v = beta c, so p = gamma m_e beta c. Also, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), we can write beta as sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Hmm, let me compute the momentum for each.

So, for the electron: gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

So p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Wait, wait, let's do this more accurately. Let me compute the momentum for each particle.

Electron:
gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

Substituting beta_e: p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p=2.

beta_p = sqrt(1 -1/(2^2)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m_e * sqrt(3) * c.

Wait, but the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction. So the total initial momentum is the sum of these two, but considering their directions.

So the electron's momentum is positive (to the right), and the positron's is negative (to the left), so their momenta are in opposite directions.

So initial total momentum: p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction. So when adding vectors, the positron's momentum is negative.

Wait, let me think about the directions again. The electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative.

So for the positron, its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p, but since p_p is negative, it's p_e - |p_p|.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Electron's momentum: p_e = 4 * m_e * beta_e * c (since beta_e is positive, direction is right).

Positron's momentum: p_p = 2 * m_e * beta_p * c, but since it's moving left, its velocity is -beta_p c, so its momentum is -2 m_e beta_p c.

Wait, no, wait: Momentum is a vector. So electron's p = +gamma m_e beta c, positron's p is -gamma m_e beta c.

So the total initial momentum is:

p_initial = (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + (gamma_p m_e beta_p c) * (-1) 

Because the positron's direction is opposite.

So substituting:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4, gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2.

So,

p_initial = (4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c) - (2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c )

Simplify each term:

4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) = m_e * sqrt(15).

2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) = m_e * sqrt(3).

So,

p_initial = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) c.

Hmm, okay, so the initial total momentum is in the positive direction (to the right) because sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3.872 - 1.732 ≈2.14, so positive.

So, after annihilation, two photons are produced, and their momenta must sum to this initial momentum.

But wait, photons are massless and their momentum is in the direction of propagation. Also, the energy of a photon is E = pc, since for photons, E^2 = (pc)^2 c^2 (since m=0, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → E=pc for photons).

So each photon has energy E1 = pc, and E2 = pc. Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy, so E1 = E2.

But the problem also states that their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right. So the two photons are moving in the right direction but above and below the horizontal. So their angles from the horizontal are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, perhaps. Let's think about their directions.

Let me imagine the coordinate system, horizontal being the x-axis, and vertical the y-axis. The upper-right direction implies the photon is moving at some positive angle θ from the x-axis. The lower-right direction would be at an angle of -θ, but since the angle between the two photons would be 2θ.

But wait, perhaps one is at an angle θ above the x-axis, and the other is θ below, so the angle between them is 2θ. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps the angle between them is 180 - 2θ, but I'll have to work that out.

Now, since the two photons must conserve momentum, their momenta vectors must add up to the initial momentum. So let me model this.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: direction at angle θ above the x-axis, momentum p1.

Photon 2: direction at angle -θ below the x-axis, momentum p2.

But wait, the problem says one is upper-right and another lower-right. I think they could be symmetric about the x-axis. So perhaps their angles from the x-axis are θ and -θ. But the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. Since E = pc, and their energies are same, then their magnitudes of momentum are same: p1 = p2 = p.

So each photon has momentum p, but in directions symmetric about the x-axis.

So the total momentum after the collision is the sum of the two momentum vectors of the photons.

So the total momentum is:

p_total = p1 + p2.

But since p1 and p2 are vectors, let's break them into x and y components.

p1_x = p * cosθ

p1_y = p * sinθ

p2_x = p * cos(-θ) = p cosθ

p2_y = p * sin(-θ) = -p sinθ

So adding them together:

p_total_x = p cosθ + p cosθ = 2 p cosθ

p_total_y = p sinθ - p sinθ = 0.

So the total momentum after the collision is (2 p cosθ) in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.

But the initial total momentum was p_initial = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c in the x-direction.

So, according to conservation of momentum, the total momentum after must equal the initial.

So:

2 p cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

And since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, the y-components must cancel out, which they do because p_total_y is zero.

Now, the energy part: total energy before collision must equal the total energy after.

The initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each of their energies is E = gamma m_e c^2.

So, electron's energy E_e = 4 m_e c^2.

Positron's energy E_p = 2 m_e c^2.

Total initial energy E_initial = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

The total energy after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' energies: E1 + E2.

But the problem states that E1 = E2 = E_photon.

So E_photon = E1 = E2.

Each photon's energy is E_photon = p c, since for a photon E = pc.

So total energy after is 2 p c.

Conservation of energy gives:

2 p c = 6 m_e c^2.

Dividing both sides by c:

2 p =6 m_e c.

So p = 3 m_e c.

Wait, that's interesting. So each photon's momentum is p =3 m_e c.

Wait, but earlier we had 2 p cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

So substituting p =3 m_e c into that equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

Simplify:

6 m_e c cosθ = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Hmm, let me compute that.

Compute sqrt(15): approx 3.872.

sqrt(3): approx 1.732.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.140.

Divide by 6: 2.140 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So cosθ ≈ 0.3567.

θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ about 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420, so 0.3567 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator: arccos(0.3567). Well, let's compute it.

I can compute using a calculator: 0.3567 → theta ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact angle. But maybe I can proceed without the exact value.

Now, the question is, what is the angle between the two photons' directions.

Each photon is moving at angles θ and -θ from the x-axis. So the angle between the two photons is 2θ.

Wait, no. Because one is at +θ and the other at -θ. So the angle between them is 2θ. Because the angle between the two vectors is θ - (-θ) = 2θ.

So if θ is about 69 degrees, then 2θ is about 138 degrees.

Looking back at the options, option C is 138 degrees, and option B is 172, which is close to 180, perhaps the supplement.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck: when you have two angles θ above the x-axis and θ below, the angle between them would be 180 - 2θ? Or 2θ?

Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. Imagine photon1 is at θ above x-axis, photon2 is at θ below. The angle between them is the angle between photon1 and photon2, which is θ (from x-axis) above and θ below. So the total angle between them is 2θ.

Wait, for example, if θ is 30 degrees, then the angle between the two photons would be 60 degrees.

So in our case, θ is approximately 69 degrees, so the angle between them would be approximately 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Earlier, I thought that the angle between the two photons is 2θ, but the problem states that one is moving in the upper-right and another in the lower-right direction. So the angle between them is the angle each makes with the x-axis, and then the total angle between them is the sum of those.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the angles each photon makes with the x-axis and the angle between them.

Another approach: the two photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction. So their directions form a 'V' shape opening to the right. The angle between them would be the angle between their two direction vectors.

So, if each photon is at θ above and below the x-axis, the angle between them is 2θ.

Thus, if θ is approximately 69 degrees, the angle between them is about 138 degrees, which is option C.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculation of cosθ.

Earlier, I had:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(15) ≈3.872983346
sqrt(3)≈1.732050808

So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) = 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 ≈0.3568220897.

So cosθ = 0.35682209.

What is θ? Let's compute arccos(0.35682209).

Using a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is about 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(65 degrees) is approx 0.4226, cos(70) ≈ 0.3420.

Wait, wait, wait, 0.3568 is between cos(69) and cos(70), perhaps closer to 69. So perhaps 69 degrees.

So 2θ would be 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of momentum and energy principles.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors \( \gamma_e = 4 \) and \( \gamma_p = 2 \), respectively. Their velocities are \( v_e = \beta_e c \) and \( v_p = \beta_p c \), where \( \beta = v/c \). Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \), we calculate:

- For the electron:  
  \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/4^2} = \sqrt{15/16} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682 \).  
  Momentum:  
  \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e (\sqrt{15}/4) c = m_e \sqrt{15} c \).

- For the positron:  
  \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/2^2} = \sqrt{3/4} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660 \).  
  Momentum:  
  \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e (\sqrt{3}/2) c = m_e \sqrt{3} c \).

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

### Step 2: Final Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \) and momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c \). The photons move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the horizontal. Their momentum components are:

- Photon 1 (upper-right):  
  \( p_{1x} = p \cos\theta, \, p_{1y} = p \sin\theta \).

- Photon 2 (lower-right):  
  \( p_{2x} = p \cos\theta, \, p_{2y} = -p \sin\theta \).

The total momentum after annihilation is:  
\[
p_{\text{final}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x}, \, p_{1y} + p_{2y} = (2p \cos\theta, 0).
\]

By conservation of momentum, \( p_{\text{final}} = p_{\text{initial}} \), so:  
\[
2p \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

### Step 3: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies:  
\[
E_{\text{final}} = 2 E_{\text{photon}}.
\]

By conservation of energy:  
\[
2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

Since \( E_{\text{photon}} = p_{\text{photon}} c \), we find:  
\[
p = 3 m_e c.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta \)
Substitute \( p = 3 m_e c \) into \( 2p \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c \):  
\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) c.
\]

Simplify:  
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

Calculate \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):  
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]

Thus:  
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between Photons
The photons are symmetrically placed at \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:  
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
