Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The Pi is at rest, and I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy has to be conserved. So the initial energy should equal the sum of the energies of the decay products. But wait, the neutrino is tricky because it's a lepton and I think it's massless, right? Or is it? Wait, neutrinos do have mass, but for most purposes, especially in these kinds of problems, they're considered massless. I'll assume the neutrino is massless here unless stated otherwise.

The Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, the decay products must share both.

So the initial momentum of the Pi is zero because it's stationary. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. Oh wait, but since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum in units where c=1. That might be useful.

Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, right? So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic because it's massless, so E_nu = K_nu.

So, conservation of energy gives:

m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu.

And conservation of momentum gives: p_mu = -p_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu = |p_nu|. And for the muon, its energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, maybe I should just work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, let's set c=1 for simplicity. Then the equations become easier.

So, m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Energy conservation: m_pi = (m_mu + K_mu) + K_nu.

Momentum conservation: p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). And for the neutrino, E_nu = p.

So substituting into energy conservation:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

Let me write that equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

I can rearrange this to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2).

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p = 105.7^2.

Compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2. Let's compute that:

140^2 = 19600.

2*140*0.4 = 112.

0.4^2=0.16.

So 139.6^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let's compute 105^2 is 11025, plus 0.7^2=0.49, and the cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So back to equation:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 p.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16.

Then minus 172.49: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 p.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

Solve for p: p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 29.8 is 0.2 less than 30, so subtract 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

So 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Which is a little over our 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 is a bit too high.

Wait, perhaps 29.7?

Compute 279.2 *29.7.

29.7 = 30 - 0.3.

279.2 *30 = 8376.

279.2 *0.3 = 83.76.

So subtract: 8376 -83.76=8292.24.

Which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, 29.75 perhaps. Let's try 29.75.

279.2 *29.75 = 279.2*(29 +0.75) = 279.2*29 +279.2*0.75.

279.2 *29: 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 *0.75 = 209.4.

So total is 8096.8 +209.4=8306.2.

Which is still less than 8315.67.

Difference is 8315.67 -8306.2=9.47.

How much more p do we need? Each 0.1 in p adds 27.92 (279.2 *0.1=27.92) to the product.

So 9.47 /27.92 ≈ 0.34.

So p =29.75 +0.34=30.09? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29 = ?

279 *29: 279*30=8370 minus 279 → 8370-279=8091.

But 279.2 is 279 +0.2, so 279.2 *29= 8091 + (0.2 *29) → 8091 +5.8=8096.8.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me just calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 × 29.8 = ?

Calculate 279.2 × 30 =8376.

Subtract 279.2 × 0.2 =55.84.

So 8376 -55.84=8320.16, which is larger than 8315.67.

So 279.2 × 29.8 =8320.16.

But we have 8315.67. So the difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49.

So perhaps 29.8 minus (4.49/279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈29.784.

Wait, but perhaps I should just do the division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 = ?

Well, approximately 29.78.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now that I have p, let's find the energies of muon and neutrino.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.78^2: approx 29.78 *29.78.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 ≈ (30 -0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2=900 -13.2 +0.0484≈886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.8484 +11172.49 ≈12059.34.

Square root of 12059.34 is about sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.78 MeV. So K_nu=29.78 MeV.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations?

Alternative approach: Maybe there's a formula for the maximum possible KE of the muon, but given that the Pi is at rest, the muon can't have more KE than the available energy minus its rest mass.

Wait, another way: The total energy of the decay products must equal the mass of Pi. So the available energy is m_pi =139.6 MeV.

The sum of the energies of muon and neutrino is 139.6 MeV.

But the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and neutrino's energy is E_nu = p.

So, sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Which is the equation I solved earlier.

After solving, we found p≈29.78 MeV, and E_mu ≈109.81 MeV, so K_mu = E_mu - m_mu =4.11 MeV.

So the neutrino has K_nu =29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That seems correct.

But let me check other options.

Option B: 7.2 and 32.8. Wait, 7.2+32.8=40, which is bigger than 139.6? That's impossible, because the sum of kinetic energies can't exceed the rest mass. Wait, no, because the sum of the kinetic energies plus rest masses is the total. Wait, no, the sum of the energies (KE + rest) of the products is equal to the initial energy.

Wait, the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and its energy is 105.7+4.12=109.82 MeV. The neutrino has energy 29.8 MeV. So total is 109.82+29.8=139.62 MeV, which matches the Pi's rest mass.

So option D is correct.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]

Thus, energy conservation becomes:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero:
\[
\vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_{\nu} = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_{\nu}| = p.
\]

For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

For the neutrino, its energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
m_{\pi^+} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

\[
(m_{\pi^+} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the muon, its energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies are approximately \(K_{\mu^+} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(K_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The Pi is at rest, and I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy has to be conserved. So the initial energy should equal the sum of the energies of the decay products. But wait, the neutrino is tricky because it's a lepton and I think it's massless, right? Or is it? Wait, neutrinos do have mass, but for most purposes, especially in these kinds of problems, they're considered massless. I'll assume the neutrino is massless here unless stated otherwise.

The Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, the decay products must share both.

So the initial momentum of the Pi is zero because it's stationary. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. Oh wait, but since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum in units where c=1. That might be useful.

Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, right? So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic because it's massless, so E_nu = K_nu.

So, conservation of energy gives:

m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu.

And conservation of momentum gives: p_mu = -p_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu = |p_nu|. And for the muon, its energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, maybe I should just work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, let's set c=1 for simplicity. Then the equations become easier.

So, m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Energy conservation: m_pi = (m_mu + K_mu) + K_nu.

Momentum conservation: p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). And for the neutrino, E_nu = p.

So substituting into energy conservation:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

Let me write that equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

I can rearrange this to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2).

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p = 105.7^2.

Compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2. Let's compute that:

140^2 = 19600.

2*140*0.4 = 112.

0.4^2=0.16.

So 139.6^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let's compute 105^2 is 11025, plus 0.7^2=0.49, and the cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So back to equation:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 p.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16.

Then minus 172.49: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 p.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

Solve for p: p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 29.8 is 0.2 less than 30, so subtract 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

So 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Which is a little over our 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 is a bit too high.

Wait, perhaps 29.7?

Compute 279.2 *29.7.

29.7 = 30 - 0.3.

279.2 *30 = 8376.

279.2 *0.3 = 83.76.

So subtract: 8376 -83.76=8292.24.

Which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, 29.75 perhaps. Let's try 29.75.

279.2 *29.75 = 279.2*(29 +0.75) = 279.2*29 +279.2*0.75.

279.2 *29: 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 *0.75 = 209.4.

So total is 8096.8 +209.4=8306.2.

Which is still less than 8315.67.

Difference is 8315.67 -8306.2=9.47.

How much more p do we need? Each 0.1 in p adds 27.92 (279.2 *0.1=27.92) to the product.

So 9.47 /27.92 ≈ 0.34.

So p =29.75 +0.34=30.09? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29 = ?

279 *29: 279*30=8370 minus 279 → 8370-279=8091.

But 279.2 is 279 +0.2, so 279.2 *29= 8091 + (0.2 *29) → 8091 +5.8=8096.8.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me just calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 × 29.8 = ?

Calculate 279.2 × 30 =8376.

Subtract 279.2 × 0.2 =55.84.

So 8376 -55.84=8320.16, which is larger than 8315.67.

So 279.2 × 29.8 =8320.16.

But we have 8315.67. So the difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49.

So perhaps 29.8 minus (4.49/279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈29.784.

Wait, but perhaps I should just do the division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 = ?

Well, approximately 29.78.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now that I have p, let's find the energies of muon and neutrino.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.78^2: approx 29.78 *29.78.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 ≈ (30 -0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2=900 -13.2 +0.0484≈886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.8484 +11172.49 ≈12059.34.

Square root of 12059.34 is about sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.78 MeV. So K_nu=29.78 MeV.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations?

Alternative approach: Maybe there's a formula for the maximum possible KE of the muon, but given that the Pi is at rest, the muon can't have more KE than the available energy minus its rest mass.

Wait, another way: The total energy of the decay products must equal the mass of Pi. So the available energy is m_pi =139.6 MeV.

The sum of the energies of muon and neutrino is 139.6 MeV.

But the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and neutrino's energy is E_nu = p.

So, sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Which is the equation I solved earlier.

After solving, we found p≈29.78 MeV, and E_mu ≈109.81 MeV, so K_mu = E_mu - m_mu =4.11 MeV.

So the neutrino has K_nu =29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That seems correct.

But let me check other options.

Option B: 7.2 and 32.8. Wait, 7.2+32.8=40, which is bigger than 139.6? That's impossible, because the sum of kinetic energies can't exceed the rest mass. Wait, no, because the sum of the kinetic energies plus rest masses is the total. Wait, no, the sum of the energies (KE + rest) of the products is equal to the initial energy.

Wait, the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and its energy is 105.7+4.12=109.82 MeV. The neutrino has energy 29.8 MeV. So total is 109.82+29.8=139.62 MeV, which matches the Pi's rest mass.

So option D is correct.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]

Thus, energy conservation becomes:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = m_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero:
\[
\vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_{\nu} = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_{\nu}| = p.
\]

For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

For the neutrino, its energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
m_{\pi^+} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

\[
(m_{\pi^+} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the muon, its energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies are approximately \(K_{\mu^+} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(K_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), which matches **Option D**.
