Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it's decayed. But wait, this is a probability thing, so I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential model, right?

Wait, the decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes. So that must relate to the decay constant. The formula I remember is the probability of decay, P, is 1 minus e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. So P = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that P is 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange that. e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me recall exact value. Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, so λ is about 0.0038566 per minute. Now the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since we are given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we're looking for the conditional probability.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed before.

Alternatively, the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it decays by 200 minus the probability it decayed by 50.

So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Alternatively, since it's memoryless, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from time zero, multiplied by the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the conditional probability.

Wait, another approach: since the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any point, given it hasn't decayed yet.

So the formula is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the overall probability in 150 minutes. But wait, does that take into account that 50 minutes have already passed without decay? Because the process is memoryless, the probability only depends on the remaining time.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=50. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=0, given that it hasn't decayed before t=50.

Alternatively, the survival probability up to t=50 is e^(-λ*50). The survival probability up to t=200 is e^(-λ*200). The probability it decays between 50 and 200 is the difference: e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200) = e^(-λ*50) (1 - e^(-λ*150)).

But wait, since the decay process is memoryless, the conditional probability P(decays in next 150 | hasn't decayed in 50) is equal to the probability it decays in 150 minutes, because the past doesn't affect the future.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it as the conditional probability. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is (probability it decays by 200) minus (probability it decays by 50) divided by (probability it hasn't decayed by 50).

Wait, let's write that out properly.

P(decay in 50 to 200) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

The conditional probability is this value divided by (1 - P(decay by 50)), which is e^(-λ*50), because P(decay by 50)=1 - e^(-λ*50).

So, [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) / e^(-λ*50) * e^(λ*50))?

Wait, let me compute that division: [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) / e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*50) ?

Wait, no, 200 is 50 + 150. So 200 -50 is 150.

Wait, e^(-λ*200) is e^(-λ*(50+150)) = e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*150).

So substituting that into the numerator:

e^(-λ*50) - [e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*150)] = e^(-λ*50) [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

So when we divide by e^(-λ*50), the term becomes 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Thus, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the current time.

But wait, that's the same as the probability we're being asked for. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Alternatively, perhaps I should directly compute λ from the given data.

Let me re-calculate λ. We know that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking ln: -λ*100 = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). I think ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, but 0.68 is a bit less. Hmm, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me think, ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(17/25). Alternatively, using a calculator approach, but perhaps I can approximate it.

Wait, another approach: I'll just compute λ using the known value. Let me calculate ln(0.68):

Using the approximation, ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108, ln(0.68) is higher (closer to zero) than that. Let's see: 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me think in terms of taylor series or remember exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator function in my mind. Let me recall that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, I need to find P(decays in next 150 minutes), which is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.5785.

So, e^(-0.5785) ≈ ?

I remember that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute e^(-0.5785). Let me think, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can approximate using Taylor series or use a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

Wait, another approach: using e^{-x} ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 for small x, but that's only good for small x. But 0.5785 isn't that small. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a known value. Let me think that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so e^{-0.6931}=0.5. So e^(-0.5785) is higher than 0.5.

Wait, let me compute e^(-0.5785):

We can use the formula:

e^{-a} ≈ (1 - a + a²/2 - a^3/(6)) for a small a, but 0.5785 is a bit too large for a good approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that ln(0.56) is approximately what? Let's see, e^{-0.5785} ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it numerically:

We have e^{-0.5785} = 1 / e^{0.5785}.

Compute e^{0.5785}:

We know that e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.6 is about 1.82211, e^0.5785 is between these.

Let me find e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872; e^{0.5785} can be approximated as follows.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.5785 is 0.0785. Let me compute the Taylor expansion around a=0.5.

f(a + h) ≈ f(a) + h f'(a) + h² f''(a)/2.

f(a) = e^a; f'(a)=e^a, f''(a)=e^a.

So f(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^{0.5} + 0.0785 * e^{0.5} + (0.0785)^2 * e^{0.5}/2.

Calculating:

e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

0.0785 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.1300.

(0.0785)^2 ≈ 0.00616. Divided by 2: 0.00308. Multiply by 1.64872: 0.00508.

So total approximation: 1.64872 + 0.1300 + 0.00508 ≈ 1.7838.

But the actual e^{0.5785} is probably higher than this, since the expansion is around 0.5 and higher terms would contribute more. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that e^{0.5785} is approximately 1.7838, so 1/1.7838 ≈ 0.56.

Wait, but let's check with another approach. Let me compute e^{0.5785}.

We know that 0.5785 is 0.5 +0.07 +0.0085.

We have e^{0.5} = 1.64872; e^{0.07} ≈ 1.072508; e^{0.0085} ≈ 1.00856.

So e^{0.5785} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.07} * e^{0.0085} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.072508 * 1.00856.

Calculate 1.64872 * 1.072508 first.

1.64872 * 1.072508 ≈ Let me compute 1.64872 * 1.07 = approximately 1.64872 * (1 + 0.07) = 1.64872 + 0.1154104 = 1.76413. But more accurately:

1.64872 * 1.072508 = ?

Let me compute 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.07 = 0.1154104.

1.64872 * 0.002508 = approximately 0.004137.

Adding them: 1.64872 + 0.1154104 = 1.76413; + 0.004137 ≈ 1.76827.

Now multiply by 1.00856: 1.76827 * 1.00856 ≈ 1.76827 + (1.76827 * 0.00856).

1.76827 * 0.00856 ≈ 0.01522.

So total ≈ 1.76827 + 0.01522 ≈ 1.78349.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78349 → e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 / 1.78349 ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, or 44%. So the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the initial data gave a 32% chance in 100 minutes, so λ is 0.0038566 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, the exponent is 0.0038566 *150 = 0.5785. So 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute e^{-0.5785} more accurately. Maybe my approximation was a bit off. Let me consider that e^{-0.5785} is approximately 0.56, so 1-0.56=0.44.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation, but I think 44% is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model for radioactive atoms. The probability of decay by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using the approximation \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes depends only on the remaining time. The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate it as follows. We know \( e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \) and \( e^{-0.6} \approx 0.5488 \). Since \( 0.5785 \) is between \( 0.5 \) and \( 0.6 \), we interpolate to estimate \( e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.56 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
P(150) \approx 44\%
\]

Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, corresponding to option A.

Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it's decayed. But wait, this is a probability thing, so I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential model, right?

Wait, the decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes. So that must relate to the decay constant. The formula I remember is the probability of decay, P, is 1 minus e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. So P = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that P is 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange that. e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me recall exact value. Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, so λ is about 0.0038566 per minute. Now the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since we are given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we're looking for the conditional probability.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed before.

Alternatively, the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it decays by 200 minus the probability it decayed by 50.

So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Alternatively, since it's memoryless, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from time zero, multiplied by the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the conditional probability.

Wait, another approach: since the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any point, given it hasn't decayed yet.

So the formula is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the overall probability in 150 minutes. But wait, does that take into account that 50 minutes have already passed without decay? Because the process is memoryless, the probability only depends on the remaining time.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=50. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=0, given that it hasn't decayed before t=50.

Alternatively, the survival probability up to t=50 is e^(-λ*50). The survival probability up to t=200 is e^(-λ*200). The probability it decays between 50 and 200 is the difference: e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200) = e^(-λ*50) (1 - e^(-λ*150)).

But wait, since the decay process is memoryless, the conditional probability P(decays in next 150 | hasn't decayed in 50) is equal to the probability it decays in 150 minutes, because the past doesn't affect the future.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it as the conditional probability. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is (probability it decays by 200) minus (probability it decays by 50) divided by (probability it hasn't decayed by 50).

Wait, let's write that out properly.

P(decay in 50 to 200) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

The conditional probability is this value divided by (1 - P(decay by 50)), which is e^(-λ*50), because P(decay by 50)=1 - e^(-λ*50).

So, [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) / e^(-λ*50) * e^(λ*50))?

Wait, let me compute that division: [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) / e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*50) ?

Wait, no, 200 is 50 + 150. So 200 -50 is 150.

Wait, e^(-λ*200) is e^(-λ*(50+150)) = e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*150).

So substituting that into the numerator:

e^(-λ*50) - [e^(-λ*50) * e^(-λ*150)] = e^(-λ*50) [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

So when we divide by e^(-λ*50), the term becomes 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Thus, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the current time.

But wait, that's the same as the probability we're being asked for. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Alternatively, perhaps I should directly compute λ from the given data.

Let me re-calculate λ. We know that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking ln: -λ*100 = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). I think ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, but 0.68 is a bit less. Hmm, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me think, ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(17/25). Alternatively, using a calculator approach, but perhaps I can approximate it.

Wait, another approach: I'll just compute λ using the known value. Let me calculate ln(0.68):

Using the approximation, ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108, ln(0.68) is higher (closer to zero) than that. Let's see: 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me think in terms of taylor series or remember exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator function in my mind. Let me recall that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, I need to find P(decays in next 150 minutes), which is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.5785.

So, e^(-0.5785) ≈ ?

I remember that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute e^(-0.5785). Let me think, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can approximate using Taylor series or use a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

Wait, another approach: using e^{-x} ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 for small x, but that's only good for small x. But 0.5785 isn't that small. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a known value. Let me think that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so e^{-0.6931}=0.5. So e^(-0.5785) is higher than 0.5.

Wait, let me compute e^(-0.5785):

We can use the formula:

e^{-a} ≈ (1 - a + a²/2 - a^3/(6)) for a small a, but 0.5785 is a bit too large for a good approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that ln(0.56) is approximately what? Let's see, e^{-0.5785} ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it numerically:

We have e^{-0.5785} = 1 / e^{0.5785}.

Compute e^{0.5785}:

We know that e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.6 is about 1.82211, e^0.5785 is between these.

Let me find e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872; e^{0.5785} can be approximated as follows.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.5785 is 0.0785. Let me compute the Taylor expansion around a=0.5.

f(a + h) ≈ f(a) + h f'(a) + h² f''(a)/2.

f(a) = e^a; f'(a)=e^a, f''(a)=e^a.

So f(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^{0.5} + 0.0785 * e^{0.5} + (0.0785)^2 * e^{0.5}/2.

Calculating:

e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

0.0785 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.1300.

(0.0785)^2 ≈ 0.00616. Divided by 2: 0.00308. Multiply by 1.64872: 0.00508.

So total approximation: 1.64872 + 0.1300 + 0.00508 ≈ 1.7838.

But the actual e^{0.5785} is probably higher than this, since the expansion is around 0.5 and higher terms would contribute more. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that e^{0.5785} is approximately 1.7838, so 1/1.7838 ≈ 0.56.

Wait, but let's check with another approach. Let me compute e^{0.5785}.

We know that 0.5785 is 0.5 +0.07 +0.0085.

We have e^{0.5} = 1.64872; e^{0.07} ≈ 1.072508; e^{0.0085} ≈ 1.00856.

So e^{0.5785} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.07} * e^{0.0085} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.072508 * 1.00856.

Calculate 1.64872 * 1.072508 first.

1.64872 * 1.072508 ≈ Let me compute 1.64872 * 1.07 = approximately 1.64872 * (1 + 0.07) = 1.64872 + 0.1154104 = 1.76413. But more accurately:

1.64872 * 1.072508 = ?

Let me compute 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.07 = 0.1154104.

1.64872 * 0.002508 = approximately 0.004137.

Adding them: 1.64872 + 0.1154104 = 1.76413; + 0.004137 ≈ 1.76827.

Now multiply by 1.00856: 1.76827 * 1.00856 ≈ 1.76827 + (1.76827 * 0.00856).

1.76827 * 0.00856 ≈ 0.01522.

So total ≈ 1.76827 + 0.01522 ≈ 1.78349.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78349 → e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 / 1.78349 ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, or 44%. So the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the initial data gave a 32% chance in 100 minutes, so λ is 0.0038566 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, the exponent is 0.0038566 *150 = 0.5785. So 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute e^{-0.5785} more accurately. Maybe my approximation was a bit off. Let me consider that e^{-0.5785} is approximately 0.56, so 1-0.56=0.44.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation, but I think 44% is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model for radioactive atoms. The probability of decay by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using the approximation \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes depends only on the remaining time. The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate it as follows. We know \( e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \) and \( e^{-0.6} \approx 0.5488 \). Since \( 0.5785 \) is between \( 0.5 \) and \( 0.6 \), we interpolate to estimate \( e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.56 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
P(150) \approx 44\%
\]

Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, corresponding to option A.
