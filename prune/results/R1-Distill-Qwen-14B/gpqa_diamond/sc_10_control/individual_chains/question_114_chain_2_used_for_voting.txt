Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, there's something about the Strecker synthesis or maybe some kind of cyanohydrin formation. Oh wait, right! The cyanohydrin reaction. That's when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. Then the CN- attacks, and after some steps, you get a cyanohydrin. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. So A must be an acid catalyst.

Looking at the options for A: Option A is H3O+ (which is a strong acid), Option C is NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh right, sodium bisulfite is commonly used as a source of HSO3^- ions, which can act as a mild acid. But sometimes it's used in other reactions, like maybe for sulfonamides or in some substitution reactions.

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin reaction, you typically use a strong acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+. Because the mechanism involves acid catalysis. So for A, which is the reagent in the first reaction, the correct choice would be H3O+ (option A or B), or perhaps NaHSO3 (option C or D).

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The cyanohydrin formation uses an acid catalyst. So the first step is the protonation of the ketone's carbonyl oxygen. Then the nucleophilic attack by CN- occurs. So the acid should be strong enough to protonate the carbonyl. H3O+ is definitely a strong acid (from sulfuric acid, for example). NaHSO3 is a weaker acid because HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, no, wait. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+? Let me think about the pKa values. H3O+ has a pKa of about -1.7. HSO3^- has a pKa around 1.8 (since H2SO3 has pKa1 ~1.8, pKa2 ~7.2). So H3O+ is a much stronger acid. So, in the first reaction, using H3O+ would provide the necessary H+ for the acid catalysis. So A should be H3O+. So looking at the options, A is H3O+ in options A and B.

Now, the second reaction is where the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (or the substituted version in the second case), and the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Wait, to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually need to hydrolyze the nitrile. There are different ways to do this. One common method is using strong acid and water, like H2SO4 and H2O under high temperature. Another method is using a mild acid with H2O, but maybe that's for primary or secondary amines or something else.

Wait, another thing I remember: nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the conversion to carboxylic acids, you typically use strong acid and heat. Alternatively, maybe another reagent is used.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So looking at the options, B can be HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D).

Wait, but generally, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic conditions. For example, using H2SO4 as a catalyst and heating with water. But sometimes, you might use a strong acid like HCl. Alternatively, maybe using a strong base like NaOH can give a different product, like a carboxylate, which upon acid workup becomes the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and it's in the presence of H2O. So let's think about the conditions required. Starting from a nitrile (R-CN) to a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) typically requires the following steps: first, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to an amide (R-CONH2), which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under strong acidic or basic conditions, the nitrile can be converted directly to the acid.

But wait, the starting material is a 2-hydroxy-... nitrile. So maybe the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile group. So when hydrolyzed, perhaps it affects the acidity.

Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and acid, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a ketone. Wait, no, wait: nitriles hydrolyze to amides, which then can be further hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, another thought: perhaps the reagent is a strong acid that protonates the nitrile, facilitating the attack of water. So if the reaction uses HCl (a strong acid) as reagent B, that would make sense.

Wait, but the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So which is more likely?

Option A: B = HCl
Option B: B = CH3COOH
Option C: B = HCl
Option D: B = CH3COOH

So, for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid, using HCl (option A or C) would be a strong acid. But perhaps CH3COOH is a mild acid. Wait, in the presence of H2O, what happens?

Wait, I remember that nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you might use H2SO4 and H2O. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used as the acid.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you have a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps the conditions are different. Because the molecule is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you have to be careful about the neighboring group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and acid (A), it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and acid. The cyanide would add to the carbonyl, making the cyanohydrin: (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but then the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be adding a hydroxyl and cyano group to the same carbon. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Let me count the carbons. Butanone is four carbons, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have four carbons in the chain, with the nitrile on carbon 4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH(CH3)CN)C(OH)CH2? I'm not sure, but perhaps the exact structure isn't critical for the reagents.

Anyway, moving on. The second reaction is taking this nitrile and turning it into a carboxylic acid. So the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) becomes a COOH group.

So, the reagent B along with H2O is used for this transformation.

Now, the question is, which reagent is B. The options are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you typically perform a hydrolysis. The usual conditions are acidic or basic. The acidic hydrolysis of nitriles usually involves strong acids like H2SO4, and heating. Alternatively, HCl in aqueous conditions can be used, perhaps with some oxidizing agent or other conditions.

Wait, another thought: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done via the Stephen reduction, but that's using HCl and H2O with a catalyst like mercury, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis under strong acid conditions. So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. So that would correspond to options A or C.

But wait, looking at the options:

Options for B:

A) HCl

B) CH3COOH

C) HCl

D) CH3COOH

So, in this case, either option A or C has B as HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So, if A is H3O+ (as per the first reaction's need for acid), then the options for A being H3O+ are A and B. So let's see:

If A is H3O+, then for the first reaction, that's correct because H3O+ is a strong acid for the cyanohydrin formation.

Then, for the second reaction, if B is HCl (as in option A), that would make sense because HCl is a strong acid to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe another approach: think about the reagent in the second reaction. I remember that the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with concentrated HCl and water under reflux. So if B is HCl, that's correct.

Wait, but what about the other options? If B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, would that be sufficient for hydrolyzing the nitrile?

I'm not sure. I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires stronger acidic conditions, so perhaps B needs to be HCl.

So, putting it together:

First reaction: A must be H3O+.

Second reaction: B must be HCl.

Looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl?

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Yes, that's option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if the first reaction requires H3O+ as A, and the second requires HCl as B, then option A is correct.

Wait, but what about the second reaction's reagent? Another thought: perhaps the second reaction doesn't need a strong acid. Maybe it's a different reaction, like a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but then followed by acid workup. But in the question, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So perhaps the reagent is part of an acidic aqueous solution.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is done using a mild acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction produces a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So it's a cyanohydrin. Now, when you hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, you have to make sure that the adjacent hydroxyl group doesn't interfere. Maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group would affect the reaction conditions.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile is oxidized to the acid. Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in that case, the reagent would be an acid, like H2SO4. Alternatively, another oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the given reagent in the second reaction is B, and it's used with H2O. So perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis followed by oxidation.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis where the nitrile becomes an amide first, then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But the reagent is HCl, which is a strong acid. So in that case, option A would be correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: for the cyanohydrin formation, sometimes the conditions are room temperature with a mild acid. But in this case, since butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A, which is an acid, perhaps the correct reagent is H3O+ as the acid, which is a strong acid.

So, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A.

The second reaction uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but wait another point: the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, when this is treated with HCl and water, it becomes 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the hydroxyl group being deprotonated in the presence of a strong acid? Hmm. Strong acid would protonate the hydroxyl group, turning it into an O-H+ (but that's not usual). Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is part of a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is at a position that can stabilize the transition state or something during the reaction.

But perhaps that's complicating things, and I should focus on the reagents.

So, putting it all together, reagent A is H3O+ for the first reaction, and reagent B is HCl for the second. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction. NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is less likely to be effective for this step.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (along with H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and is less likely to facilitate this reaction effectively.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions: H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for the nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions: NaHSO₃ is not strong enough for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as these reagents satisfy the requirements for both reactions.

**Answer: A**

The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction. NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is less likely to be effective for this step.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (along with H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and is less likely to facilitate this reaction effectively.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions: H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for the nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions: NaHSO₃ is not strong enough for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as these reagents satisfy the requirements for both reactions.
