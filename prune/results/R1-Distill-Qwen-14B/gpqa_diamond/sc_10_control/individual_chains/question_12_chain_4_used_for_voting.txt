Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I remember that when particles collide or decay, their energy and momentum are conserved. Let me see what the question is.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, neutrinos are neutral, so they don't carry charge, but in this case, the products are mu(+) and a neutrino, maybe a neutrino of some type, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in many particle physics problems, they're considered massless. I think for this problem, we can assume the neutrino is massless.

So the pion is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino, being massless, will have energy equal to its momentum times c (but since units are in MeV, perhaps we can ignore the c factor as it's already accounted for).

Let me lay out the variables. Let me denote:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV (rest mass of pion)
m_mu = 105.7 MeV (rest mass of muon)
m_nu = 0 (approximate, since neutrino mass is negligible)

Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction. Or wait, no, if the muon has momentum p, the neutrino must have momentum -p to have their sum zero. So the magnitudes are the same.

So, for the muon, its energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, wait, no, the units here are in MeV, which I think are already in terms of energy. So perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, for the muon, energy E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and for the neutrino, E_nu = p, since it's massless.

The total energy is the sum of these two: E_total = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

But the total energy must also equal the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c^2. Since we're using units where c=1, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, so E_total = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, setting up the equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me write that down:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p here. Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) as S. So S + p = 139.6. Let's subtract p from both sides: S = 139.6 - p.

Then square both sides: S^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

But S^2 is p^2 + (105.7)^2. So,

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

Ah, the p^2 terms cancel out. So,

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p.

Let me compute these terms numerically.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Wait, but maybe more accurately:

105.7 * 105.7 = ?

Let me compute:

100 * 105.7 = 10570.

5.7 * 105.7 = 5.7 * 100 = 570, 5.7 *5.7=32.49. Wait no, wait 105.7 is 100 +5.7, so 5.7 * 105.7 = 5.7 *100 +5.7 *5.7 = 570 +32.49= 602.49.

So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me calculate 140^2 = 19600. But 139.6 is 140 -0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging these numbers in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 *p.

Let me compute 2*139.6: 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Let me rearrange:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's subtract.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49) ?

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Let me compute digit by digit.

18488.16 - 11172.49 = ?

Wait, perhaps another approach.

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49) )

19488 - 11172 = 8316.

0.16 -0.49 = -0.33.

So total is 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49: let me do it correctly.

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Start from the right:

.16 - .49: Can't do that, borrow. So it becomes 1.16 -0.49 = 0.67? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.16 minus 0.49 is negative. So:

0.16 = 16 hundredths.

0.49 = 49 hundredths.

So 16 -49 = -33 hundredths = -0.33.

So the decimal part is -0.33.

Now, the integer part: 19488 - 11172 = 8316.

So overall, 8316.00 -0.33 = 8315.67? Wait, no. Because 19488.16 is 19488 + 0.16, and 11172.49 is 11172 +0.49.

So subtracting, 19488.16 -11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49) ) = 8316 -0.33 = 8315.67.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 19488.16 is 19488 units plus 0.16 of a unit, and 11172.49 is 11172 units plus 0.49. So when you subtract, it's 8316 units (from 19488 -11172) and 0.16 -0.49 = -0.33. So the total is 8315.67? Wait, no, wait. Because 8316 units minus 0.33 is 8315.67? No, wait, wait, no. Oh, I see, it's 8316 (units) minus 0.33 (units), so 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67? No, that can't be right, because 8316 units minus 0.33 units is 8315.67 units. Oh wait, no, that's correct.

So the right-hand side is 8315.67.

So 279.2 p = 8315.67.

Thus, p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

First, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So 30 would be too high. Let me try 29.8.

Wait, let's compute 279.2 * 29.8.

279.2 * 30 = 8376.

Minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

But we have 8315.67 as the numerator.

So 8320.16 is larger than 8315.67 by about 4.5.

So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.5 higher than 8315.67.

So perhaps 29.8 - (4.5 / 279.2) → approximately 29.8 - 0.016 = 29.784.

Wait, but maybe let's compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 * 29 = 8100 + (279.2 * 9) = 279.2 *10=2792, minus 279.2 → 2512.8. So 279.2 *29= 279.2*(20+9)= 279.2*20=5584 + 2512.8 = 8096.8.

So 29 gives 8096.8.

We have 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87 left.

So 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.783.

So p ≈29.783.

Wait, let me see: 279.2 *0.783.

0.7 *279.2= 195.44.

0.08 *279.2=22.336.

0.003 *279.2=0.8376.

So sum: 195.44 + 22.336=217.776 +0.8376=218.6136.

Which is close to 218.87.

So 0.783 gives 218.6136, which is 218.87-218.6136=0.2564 left.

So maybe 0.783 + (0.2564/279.2) → 0.783 + ~0.000918 ≈0.7839.

So p ≈29.7839.

So approx 29.784.

But wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute this division.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8, as I did before.

Subtract: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

218.87 ÷279.2 = approx 0.783.

So p=29.783.

So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, because we're working in units where c=1, so the momentum is in MeV/c. Hmm, but perhaps the units are just MeV, but I'm not sure. Oh, no, because momentum is in MeV/c units. So p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculating that:

29.78² ≈ 887.0.

105.7² is 11172.49, as before.

So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.81 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is the difference: 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, let me compute that again: 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Wait, the neutrino is considered to have negligible mass, so its energy is all kinetic, because its rest mass is zero. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV. But wait, wait, the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy since it's massless. So for the muon, kinetic energy is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

So looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Another way to approach this is through the conservation of energy and momentum.

Alternatively, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are the same.

Now, the total energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c². Or in units where c=1, E_mu= sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ).

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but again, in units where c=1, E_nu =p.

So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p =139.6.

That's the same equation as before.

Hmm, solving that gives p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu =p=29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(29.78² +105.7² )= sqrt(887 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12059.49)=109.80 MeV.

So muon's kinetic energy is 109.80 -105.7=4.10 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.10 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52, 20.8 → no.

D)4.12, 29.8 → yes. So option D matches.

Wait, but the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. So that matches option D.

So I think the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon (μ⁺) and neutrino (ν) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the muon's momentum be \( p \), so the neutrino's momentum is also \( p \).

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) (since the pion is stationary). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
\]

The muon's energy is given by:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
\]

where \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) is the rest mass of the muon, and \( p \) is its momentum. The neutrino's energy is simply \( E_{\nu} = p \), as it is massless.

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6
\]

Let \( S = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} \). Then:

\[
S + p = 139.6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = 139.6 - p
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
S^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
\]

Substituting \( S^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 \):

\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
\]

Canceling \( p^2 \) and simplifying:

\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
\]

Numerically:

\[
105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 2 \cdot 139.6 = 279.2
\]

Substituting:

\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p
\]

Rearranging:

\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
279.2 \cdot p = 8315.67 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

For the muon, its energy is:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its energy since it is massless:

\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **B)** \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **C)** \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **D)** \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I remember that when particles collide or decay, their energy and momentum are conserved. Let me see what the question is.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, neutrinos are neutral, so they don't carry charge, but in this case, the products are mu(+) and a neutrino, maybe a neutrino of some type, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in many particle physics problems, they're considered massless. I think for this problem, we can assume the neutrino is massless.

So the pion is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino, being massless, will have energy equal to its momentum times c (but since units are in MeV, perhaps we can ignore the c factor as it's already accounted for).

Let me lay out the variables. Let me denote:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV (rest mass of pion)
m_mu = 105.7 MeV (rest mass of muon)
m_nu = 0 (approximate, since neutrino mass is negligible)

Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction. Or wait, no, if the muon has momentum p, the neutrino must have momentum -p to have their sum zero. So the magnitudes are the same.

So, for the muon, its energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, wait, no, the units here are in MeV, which I think are already in terms of energy. So perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, for the muon, energy E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and for the neutrino, E_nu = p, since it's massless.

The total energy is the sum of these two: E_total = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

But the total energy must also equal the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c^2. Since we're using units where c=1, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, so E_total = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, setting up the equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me write that down:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p here. Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) as S. So S + p = 139.6. Let's subtract p from both sides: S = 139.6 - p.

Then square both sides: S^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

But S^2 is p^2 + (105.7)^2. So,

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

Ah, the p^2 terms cancel out. So,

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p.

Let me compute these terms numerically.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Wait, but maybe more accurately:

105.7 * 105.7 = ?

Let me compute:

100 * 105.7 = 10570.

5.7 * 105.7 = 5.7 * 100 = 570, 5.7 *5.7=32.49. Wait no, wait 105.7 is 100 +5.7, so 5.7 * 105.7 = 5.7 *100 +5.7 *5.7 = 570 +32.49= 602.49.

So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me calculate 140^2 = 19600. But 139.6 is 140 -0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging these numbers in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 *p.

Let me compute 2*139.6: 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Let me rearrange:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's subtract.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49) ?

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Let me compute digit by digit.

18488.16 - 11172.49 = ?

Wait, perhaps another approach.

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49) )

19488 - 11172 = 8316.

0.16 -0.49 = -0.33.

So total is 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49: let me do it correctly.

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Start from the right:

.16 - .49: Can't do that, borrow. So it becomes 1.16 -0.49 = 0.67? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.16 minus 0.49 is negative. So:

0.16 = 16 hundredths.

0.49 = 49 hundredths.

So 16 -49 = -33 hundredths = -0.33.

So the decimal part is -0.33.

Now, the integer part: 19488 - 11172 = 8316.

So overall, 8316.00 -0.33 = 8315.67? Wait, no. Because 19488.16 is 19488 + 0.16, and 11172.49 is 11172 +0.49.

So subtracting, 19488.16 -11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49) ) = 8316 -0.33 = 8315.67.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 19488.16 is 19488 units plus 0.16 of a unit, and 11172.49 is 11172 units plus 0.49. So when you subtract, it's 8316 units (from 19488 -11172) and 0.16 -0.49 = -0.33. So the total is 8315.67? Wait, no, wait. Because 8316 units minus 0.33 is 8315.67? No, wait, wait, no. Oh, I see, it's 8316 (units) minus 0.33 (units), so 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67? No, that can't be right, because 8316 units minus 0.33 units is 8315.67 units. Oh wait, no, that's correct.

So the right-hand side is 8315.67.

So 279.2 p = 8315.67.

Thus, p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

First, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So 30 would be too high. Let me try 29.8.

Wait, let's compute 279.2 * 29.8.

279.2 * 30 = 8376.

Minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

But we have 8315.67 as the numerator.

So 8320.16 is larger than 8315.67 by about 4.5.

So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.5 higher than 8315.67.

So perhaps 29.8 - (4.5 / 279.2) → approximately 29.8 - 0.016 = 29.784.

Wait, but maybe let's compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 * 29 = 8100 + (279.2 * 9) = 279.2 *10=2792, minus 279.2 → 2512.8. So 279.2 *29= 279.2*(20+9)= 279.2*20=5584 + 2512.8 = 8096.8.

So 29 gives 8096.8.

We have 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87 left.

So 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.783.

So p ≈29.783.

Wait, let me see: 279.2 *0.783.

0.7 *279.2= 195.44.

0.08 *279.2=22.336.

0.003 *279.2=0.8376.

So sum: 195.44 + 22.336=217.776 +0.8376=218.6136.

Which is close to 218.87.

So 0.783 gives 218.6136, which is 218.87-218.6136=0.2564 left.

So maybe 0.783 + (0.2564/279.2) → 0.783 + ~0.000918 ≈0.7839.

So p ≈29.7839.

So approx 29.784.

But wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute this division.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8, as I did before.

Subtract: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

218.87 ÷279.2 = approx 0.783.

So p=29.783.

So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, because we're working in units where c=1, so the momentum is in MeV/c. Hmm, but perhaps the units are just MeV, but I'm not sure. Oh, no, because momentum is in MeV/c units. So p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculating that:

29.78² ≈ 887.0.

105.7² is 11172.49, as before.

So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.81 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is the difference: 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, let me compute that again: 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Wait, the neutrino is considered to have negligible mass, so its energy is all kinetic, because its rest mass is zero. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV. But wait, wait, the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy since it's massless. So for the muon, kinetic energy is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

So looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Another way to approach this is through the conservation of energy and momentum.

Alternatively, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are the same.

Now, the total energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c². Or in units where c=1, E_mu= sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ).

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but again, in units where c=1, E_nu =p.

So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p =139.6.

That's the same equation as before.

Hmm, solving that gives p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu =p=29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(29.78² +105.7² )= sqrt(887 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12059.49)=109.80 MeV.

So muon's kinetic energy is 109.80 -105.7=4.10 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.10 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52, 20.8 → no.

D)4.12, 29.8 → yes. So option D matches.

Wait, but the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. So that matches option D.

So I think the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon (μ⁺) and neutrino (ν) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the muon's momentum be \( p \), so the neutrino's momentum is also \( p \).

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) (since the pion is stationary). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
\]

The muon's energy is given by:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
\]

where \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) is the rest mass of the muon, and \( p \) is its momentum. The neutrino's energy is simply \( E_{\nu} = p \), as it is massless.

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6
\]

Let \( S = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} \). Then:

\[
S + p = 139.6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = 139.6 - p
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
S^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
\]

Substituting \( S^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 \):

\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
\]

Canceling \( p^2 \) and simplifying:

\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
\]

Numerically:

\[
105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 2 \cdot 139.6 = 279.2
\]

Substituting:

\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p
\]

Rearranging:

\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
279.2 \cdot p = 8315.67 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

For the muon, its energy is:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its energy since it is massless:

\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **B)** \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **C)** \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **D)** \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
