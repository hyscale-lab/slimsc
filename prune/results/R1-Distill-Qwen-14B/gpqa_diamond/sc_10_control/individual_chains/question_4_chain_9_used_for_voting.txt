Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. That's different from our current understanding where magnets have both poles together. So, Maxwell's equations would look different in such a case. I need to figure out which equations are affected.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in our universe are four in total. Let me recall them. The first is Gauss's law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism: divergence of B equals zero. The third is Faraday's law of induction, which is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. The fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which is the curl of H equals the time derivative of D plus the current density.

In our world, magnets can't have isolated poles, so the divergence of B is zero. But if a magnet can have isolated North or South poles, then divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So the second equation would change. That would affect Gauss's law for magnetism.

Now, what about the other equations? Faraday's law and Ampère's law involve time derivatives and curls. If isolated poles exist, does that affect the curl of B? Wait, the curl of B in our equations is about the time derivative of E, but that's Faraday's law. Wait, no, Faraday's law is about the curl of E. Oh right, the curl of E equals -dB/dt. So if B's divergence can be non-zero, does that affect this equation?

Wait, the existence of isolated poles would change the source terms in the equations. Let's think: In our case, divergence of B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. If there were monopoles, divergence of B would be proportional to the density of the monopoles, similar to how divergence of E is proportional to charge density.

So the second equation (Gauss's law for magnetism) would change. But the question is about which equations are different in that universe. The options are about which of Maxwell's equations are altered.

So the first equation (electric Gauss) remains the same. The second equation (magnetic Gauss) would change. What about the others?

Faraday's law is about the curl of E, which is about the changing B. That doesn't directly depend on whether B has divergence, unless the presence of monopoles affects B's behavior. Hmm, but maybe the other equations are more about the dynamics of fields and not the sources.

Wait, the third equation is about the curl of E being -dB/dt. If B can have divergence, does that affect this equation? I don't think so because this equation is about the relation between E and the time change of B, not the sources. So Faraday's law remains the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law: curl H = dD/dt + J. That's about the sources for the magnetic field, but in Ampère's law, the sources are currents. The presence of magnetic monopoles would affect Gauss's law for B but not Ampère's law. Or wait, maybe Ampère's law would change if there are magnetic currents as well? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, so the divergence of B is zero. If they exist, then Ampère's law might have another term. Or maybe Maxwell's equations would include additional terms for magnetic charge currents. Let me think. Oh, right, if magnetic monopoles exist, then Maxwell's equations would have a magnetic current in Ampère's law and a electric current in Gauss's law for magnetism.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The four equations would change as follows. Gauss's law for electricity (div E) would remain the same. Gauss's law for magnetism (div B) would be rho_m (magnetic charge density) over some constant. Faraday's law (curl E) would have a term involving the time derivative of B, but wait, in our world, it's - dB/dt. But if B has divergence, would Faraday's law change? I'm not sure. I think Faraday's law is about the curl of E, and it's about the rate of change of B. So if B can have a divergence, but the curl of E is still about the change in B, I don't think Faraday's law itself changes. So Faraday's law remains the same.

Then Ampère's law (curl H) would have a term involving the current density J, and possibly a magnetic current. Wait, in the standard equations, Ampère's law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations are modified to include magnetic charge and current. So, the fourth equation (Ampère's law) would have an additional term for the magnetic current, similar to how the first equation has charge density.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, there are two modifications to Maxwell's equations:

1. Gauss's law for magnetism: div B = rho_m / epsilon_0 (something like that, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density).

2. Ampère's law would include a term for the magnetic current. So Ampère's law would have curl H = J_m + dD/dt? Or wait, I think Ampère's law would have a term involving the magnetic current density, J_m, similar to how Gauss's law includes J and rho.

Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall. The modified Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are usually presented as:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / epsilon_0 (changed from zero)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (wait, or is it a different term?)
4. curl H = J_e + dD/dt (unchanged except perhaps if there are magnetic currents, but I thought Ampère's law would include J_m as well?)

Hmm, maybe I should look this up in my notes. Oh wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are:

- Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = rho_m / mu_0
- Faraday's Law: curl E = - (1/c²) * (partial B/partial t) - J_m
- Ampère's Law: curl H = (1/c²) * (partial D/partial t) + J_e

Wait, no, I think the standard modification adds a term with the magnetic current in Faraday's law and the electric current in Ampère's law, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that with magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric. So:

- div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- div B = rho_m / mu_0
- curl E = - (1/c) * dB/dt - J_m
- curl H = (1/c) * dE/dt + J_e

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but the point is, Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampère's law would both change. Or maybe Ampère's law already includes J_e and if J_m exists, then it's a new term.

Wait, in our universe, Ampère's law is:

curl H = J + dD/dt

If magnetic currents exist, perhaps there's an additional term for J_m. Or maybe Ampère's law remains the same if J is a combination of electric and magnetic currents. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of magnetic monopoles would only affect the Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law.

Wait, in the scenario presented, the question is which Maxwell's equations are different. So the options are about which equations are modified.

In our universe, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = -dB/dt
4. curl H = J + dD/dt

In the universe with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and perhaps 4 would change. Or maybe 2 and 3?

Wait, if the divergence of B is non-zero, equation 2 changes. What about equation 4? If there's a magnetic current, then Ampère's law (equation 4) would have an additional term, perhaps. So equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, but Ampère's law involves the curl of H, which is related to the current J (electric current). If we have magnetic monopoles, I'm not sure if that would affect Ampère's law. Or perhaps Ampère's law remains unchanged because it's about the currents of electric charges.

Wait, maybe the flux of E comes into play. Let me think about the options again.

The options given are:

A) The one related to divergence of magnetic field. So equation 2 changes.

B) The ones related to circulation of electric field and divergence of magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2.

C) The one related to circulation of magnetic field and flux of electric field. Hmm, flux of E is Gauss's law for E, which is equation 1. So equation 1 and 3?

Wait, flux of E is equation 1. Circulation of E is equation 3. Circulation of B is equation 4?

Wait, no. Faraday's law is about curl E, which is equation 3. Ampère's law is about curl H, equation 4.

Option C says the ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) and flux of E (equation 1). But equation 1 is Gauss's law for E, and that's not affected by the existence of monopoles. So option C is probably not correct.

Option D: ones related to divergence and curl of magnetic field. Equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of H. Wait, equation 4 is curl H, which is part of Ampère's law. If there are magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would change if there's a magnetic current.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In our universe, equation 2: div B = 0. If monopoles exist, equation 2 becomes div B = something (non-zero). So equation 2 changes.

What about equation 3: curl E = -dB/dt. Does that change? If B has a divergence, but curl E is about the local change, I don't think equation 3 changes. It's more about the time variation of B than the sources.

Equation 4: curl H = J + dD/dt. If there are magnetic monopoles, would this equation change? I think Ampère's law remains the same because it's about the electric current. Unless there's a magnetic current term added.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, besides equation 2, equation 4 (Ampère's law) would have another term if there's a magnetic current. Or maybe equation 3 (Faraday's law) would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law (equation 4) would include a term for the magnetic current, J_m.

Wait, I've heard that with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric, so Ampère's law would have a term for J_e and J_m. No, that's not exactly right. Let me think: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations would be:

- Gauss's law for E: same.
- Gauss's law for B: div B = rho_m.
- Faraday's law: curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current density).
- Ampère's law: curl H = J_e + dD/dt (but I'm not sure if J_e would include anything else).

Wait, that might mean that equation 3 (Faraday's law) would change because it would have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current. So in this scenario, both equations 2 and 3 would change.

But the question says that in this universe, a magnet can have an isolated pole. So it's about static monopoles, not currents. Hmm, magnetic monopoles would have a rho_m (charge density), but do they have a current J_m?

Wait, monopoles would have a current if they move. So if in this universe, monopoles can exist, then magnetic currents would exist. So Maxwell's equations would have to account for J_m as well.

So equation 3 (curl E) would now have a term involving J_m. So equation 3 is modified. Equation 2 is modified as well.

So which equations are different? Equations 2 and 3.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to circulation of electric field (equation 3) and divergence of magnetic field (equation 2). So that's two equations.

Wait, option B says: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 3.

So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another point: Maxwell's equations in our universe include the term for displacement current in Ampère's law. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Ampère's law? Or does it only affect Gauss's law for B and Faraday's law?

Hmm, I think Ampère's law may not change because it's about the curl of H and the sources are electric currents. But I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, some sources say that with magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric, leading to:

- div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- div B = rho_m / mu_0
- curl E = - (1/c) * dB/dt - J_m
- curl H = (1/c) * dE/dt + J_e

So in this case, equations 2, 3, and 4 would have changes.

Wait, but equation 4 is Ampère's law, which would then have J_e and J_m? Or maybe it's only J_e?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Ampère's law (curl H) would include the electric current J_e, and perhaps not the magnetic current J_m. Because J_m is a magnetic current, which would appear in the Faraday's law.

So perhaps, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, only equations 2 (Gauss's B) and 3 (Faraday's law) change. Ampère's law would remain the same, only involving J_e and displacement current.

So, the modified equations would be equations 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, option B says that the equations related to circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different. So the answer is B.

Wait, the question says which of the equations are different. So options are:

A) Only equation about divergence of B.

B) Equations about circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Equations about circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Equations about divergence and curl of B.

Wait, option D says the divergence and curl of B. The curl of B is equation 3 in our universe, which is Faraday's law. But in the modified case, equation 3 changes. So equation 3 (curl E) is different, and equation 2 (div B) is different. So the equations that are different are the ones related to div B and curl E.

Wait, no. The equations are:

1. Gauss's E (div E) → same.

2. Gauss's B → different.

3. Faraday's law (curl E) → different.

4. Ampère's law (curl H) → same?

Wait, according to the symmetric Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and 3 change, but equation 4 (Ampère's law) also changes if there are magnetic currents.

Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 and 3 are different. Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 is different, and equation 3's form remains the same, but the presence of J_m is considered in another equation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me recall the standard modifications. Without getting into the details, the usual way to modify Maxwell's equations with monopoles is to have:

div B = rho_m / mu_0

and

curl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - J_m.

So, two equations are modified.

Which options reflect that?

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2.

So the answer would be option B.

In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from our standard understanding. The key modifications arise because the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces sources for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges serve as sources for the electric field. Let us analyze the implications for each of Maxwell's equations:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity (div E = ρₑ/ε₀):** This equation remains unchanged because it governs the electric field and is not affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (div B = 0):** In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to reflect the presence of magnetic charge density, such as **div B = ρₘ/μ₀**, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density. Thus, this equation is modified.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction (curl E = -∂B/∂t):** In our universe, this equation describes the relationship between the curl of the electric field and the time-varying magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, if magnetic currents exist, this equation would also change to include a term for the magnetic current density, such as **curl E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ**, where Jₘ is the magnetic current density. Therefore, this equation is modified.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (curl H = ∂D/∂t + Jₑ):** This equation governs the relationship between the curl of the magnetic field and the electric current density. While the presence of magnetic monopoles might introduce magnetic currents, Ampère's law primarily deals with electric currents and displacement currents. Thus, this equation is not directly modified by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

From this analysis, the equations that are different in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:

- **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (div B):** This equation changes due to the presence of magnetic charge density.
- **Faraday's Law (curl E):** This equation changes due to the presence of magnetic current density.

Thus, the correct option is **B**, as it corresponds to the equations related to the circulation of the electric field (Faraday's law) and the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's law for magnetism).

Answer: B

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. That's different from our current understanding where magnets have both poles together. So, Maxwell's equations would look different in such a case. I need to figure out which equations are affected.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in our universe are four in total. Let me recall them. The first is Gauss's law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism: divergence of B equals zero. The third is Faraday's law of induction, which is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. The fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which is the curl of H equals the time derivative of D plus the current density.

In our world, magnets can't have isolated poles, so the divergence of B is zero. But if a magnet can have isolated North or South poles, then divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So the second equation would change. That would affect Gauss's law for magnetism.

Now, what about the other equations? Faraday's law and Ampère's law involve time derivatives and curls. If isolated poles exist, does that affect the curl of B? Wait, the curl of B in our equations is about the time derivative of E, but that's Faraday's law. Wait, no, Faraday's law is about the curl of E. Oh right, the curl of E equals -dB/dt. So if B's divergence can be non-zero, does that affect this equation?

Wait, the existence of isolated poles would change the source terms in the equations. Let's think: In our case, divergence of B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. If there were monopoles, divergence of B would be proportional to the density of the monopoles, similar to how divergence of E is proportional to charge density.

So the second equation (Gauss's law for magnetism) would change. But the question is about which equations are different in that universe. The options are about which of Maxwell's equations are altered.

So the first equation (electric Gauss) remains the same. The second equation (magnetic Gauss) would change. What about the others?

Faraday's law is about the curl of E, which is about the changing B. That doesn't directly depend on whether B has divergence, unless the presence of monopoles affects B's behavior. Hmm, but maybe the other equations are more about the dynamics of fields and not the sources.

Wait, the third equation is about the curl of E being -dB/dt. If B can have divergence, does that affect this equation? I don't think so because this equation is about the relation between E and the time change of B, not the sources. So Faraday's law remains the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law: curl H = dD/dt + J. That's about the sources for the magnetic field, but in Ampère's law, the sources are currents. The presence of magnetic monopoles would affect Gauss's law for B but not Ampère's law. Or wait, maybe Ampère's law would change if there are magnetic currents as well? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, so the divergence of B is zero. If they exist, then Ampère's law might have another term. Or maybe Maxwell's equations would include additional terms for magnetic charge currents. Let me think. Oh, right, if magnetic monopoles exist, then Maxwell's equations would have a magnetic current in Ampère's law and a electric current in Gauss's law for magnetism.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The four equations would change as follows. Gauss's law for electricity (div E) would remain the same. Gauss's law for magnetism (div B) would be rho_m (magnetic charge density) over some constant. Faraday's law (curl E) would have a term involving the time derivative of B, but wait, in our world, it's - dB/dt. But if B has divergence, would Faraday's law change? I'm not sure. I think Faraday's law is about the curl of E, and it's about the rate of change of B. So if B can have a divergence, but the curl of E is still about the change in B, I don't think Faraday's law itself changes. So Faraday's law remains the same.

Then Ampère's law (curl H) would have a term involving the current density J, and possibly a magnetic current. Wait, in the standard equations, Ampère's law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations are modified to include magnetic charge and current. So, the fourth equation (Ampère's law) would have an additional term for the magnetic current, similar to how the first equation has charge density.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, there are two modifications to Maxwell's equations:

1. Gauss's law for magnetism: div B = rho_m / epsilon_0 (something like that, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density).

2. Ampère's law would include a term for the magnetic current. So Ampère's law would have curl H = J_m + dD/dt? Or wait, I think Ampère's law would have a term involving the magnetic current density, J_m, similar to how Gauss's law includes J and rho.

Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall. The modified Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are usually presented as:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / epsilon_0 (changed from zero)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (wait, or is it a different term?)
4. curl H = J_e + dD/dt (unchanged except perhaps if there are magnetic currents, but I thought Ampère's law would include J_m as well?)

Hmm, maybe I should look this up in my notes. Oh wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are:

- Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = rho_m / mu_0
- Faraday's Law: curl E = - (1/c²) * (partial B/partial t) - J_m
- Ampère's Law: curl H = (1/c²) * (partial D/partial t) + J_e

Wait, no, I think the standard modification adds a term with the magnetic current in Faraday's law and the electric current in Ampère's law, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that with magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric. So:

- div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- div B = rho_m / mu_0
- curl E = - (1/c) * dB/dt - J_m
- curl H = (1/c) * dE/dt + J_e

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but the point is, Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampère's law would both change. Or maybe Ampère's law already includes J_e and if J_m exists, then it's a new term.

Wait, in our universe, Ampère's law is:

curl H = J + dD/dt

If magnetic currents exist, perhaps there's an additional term for J_m. Or maybe Ampère's law remains the same if J is a combination of electric and magnetic currents. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of magnetic monopoles would only affect the Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law.

Wait, in the scenario presented, the question is which Maxwell's equations are different. So the options are about which equations are modified.

In our universe, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = -dB/dt
4. curl H = J + dD/dt

In the universe with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and perhaps 4 would change. Or maybe 2 and 3?

Wait, if the divergence of B is non-zero, equation 2 changes. What about equation 4? If there's a magnetic current, then Ampère's law (equation 4) would have an additional term, perhaps. So equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, but Ampère's law involves the curl of H, which is related to the current J (electric current). If we have magnetic monopoles, I'm not sure if that would affect Ampère's law. Or perhaps Ampère's law remains unchanged because it's about the currents of electric charges.

Wait, maybe the flux of E comes into play. Let me think about the options again.

The options given are:

A) The one related to divergence of magnetic field. So equation 2 changes.

B) The ones related to circulation of electric field and divergence of magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2.

C) The one related to circulation of magnetic field and flux of electric field. Hmm, flux of E is Gauss's law for E, which is equation 1. So equation 1 and 3?

Wait, flux of E is equation 1. Circulation of E is equation 3. Circulation of B is equation 4?

Wait, no. Faraday's law is about curl E, which is equation 3. Ampère's law is about curl H, equation 4.

Option C says the ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) and flux of E (equation 1). But equation 1 is Gauss's law for E, and that's not affected by the existence of monopoles. So option C is probably not correct.

Option D: ones related to divergence and curl of magnetic field. Equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of H. Wait, equation 4 is curl H, which is part of Ampère's law. If there are magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would change if there's a magnetic current.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In our universe, equation 2: div B = 0. If monopoles exist, equation 2 becomes div B = something (non-zero). So equation 2 changes.

What about equation 3: curl E = -dB/dt. Does that change? If B has a divergence, but curl E is about the local change, I don't think equation 3 changes. It's more about the time variation of B than the sources.

Equation 4: curl H = J + dD/dt. If there are magnetic monopoles, would this equation change? I think Ampère's law remains the same because it's about the electric current. Unless there's a magnetic current term added.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, besides equation 2, equation 4 (Ampère's law) would have another term if there's a magnetic current. Or maybe equation 3 (Faraday's law) would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law (equation 4) would include a term for the magnetic current, J_m.

Wait, I've heard that with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric, so Ampère's law would have a term for J_e and J_m. No, that's not exactly right. Let me think: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations would be:

- Gauss's law for E: same.
- Gauss's law for B: div B = rho_m.
- Faraday's law: curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current density).
- Ampère's law: curl H = J_e + dD/dt (but I'm not sure if J_e would include anything else).

Wait, that might mean that equation 3 (Faraday's law) would change because it would have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current. So in this scenario, both equations 2 and 3 would change.

But the question says that in this universe, a magnet can have an isolated pole. So it's about static monopoles, not currents. Hmm, magnetic monopoles would have a rho_m (charge density), but do they have a current J_m?

Wait, monopoles would have a current if they move. So if in this universe, monopoles can exist, then magnetic currents would exist. So Maxwell's equations would have to account for J_m as well.

So equation 3 (curl E) would now have a term involving J_m. So equation 3 is modified. Equation 2 is modified as well.

So which equations are different? Equations 2 and 3.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to circulation of electric field (equation 3) and divergence of magnetic field (equation 2). So that's two equations.

Wait, option B says: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 3.

So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another point: Maxwell's equations in our universe include the term for displacement current in Ampère's law. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Ampère's law? Or does it only affect Gauss's law for B and Faraday's law?

Hmm, I think Ampère's law may not change because it's about the curl of H and the sources are electric currents. But I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, some sources say that with magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric, leading to:

- div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
- div B = rho_m / mu_0
- curl E = - (1/c) * dB/dt - J_m
- curl H = (1/c) * dE/dt + J_e

So in this case, equations 2, 3, and 4 would have changes.

Wait, but equation 4 is Ampère's law, which would then have J_e and J_m? Or maybe it's only J_e?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Ampère's law (curl H) would include the electric current J_e, and perhaps not the magnetic current J_m. Because J_m is a magnetic current, which would appear in the Faraday's law.

So perhaps, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, only equations 2 (Gauss's B) and 3 (Faraday's law) change. Ampère's law would remain the same, only involving J_e and displacement current.

So, the modified equations would be equations 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, option B says that the equations related to circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different. So the answer is B.

Wait, the question says which of the equations are different. So options are:

A) Only equation about divergence of B.

B) Equations about circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Equations about circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Equations about divergence and curl of B.

Wait, option D says the divergence and curl of B. The curl of B is equation 3 in our universe, which is Faraday's law. But in the modified case, equation 3 changes. So equation 3 (curl E) is different, and equation 2 (div B) is different. So the equations that are different are the ones related to div B and curl E.

Wait, no. The equations are:

1. Gauss's E (div E) → same.

2. Gauss's B → different.

3. Faraday's law (curl E) → different.

4. Ampère's law (curl H) → same?

Wait, according to the symmetric Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and 3 change, but equation 4 (Ampère's law) also changes if there are magnetic currents.

Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 and 3 are different. Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 is different, and equation 3's form remains the same, but the presence of J_m is considered in another equation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me recall the standard modifications. Without getting into the details, the usual way to modify Maxwell's equations with monopoles is to have:

div B = rho_m / mu_0

and

curl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - J_m.

So, two equations are modified.

Which options reflect that?

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2.

So the answer would be option B.


In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from our standard understanding. The key modifications arise because the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces sources for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges serve as sources for the electric field. Let us analyze the implications for each of Maxwell's equations:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity (div E = ρₑ/ε₀):** This equation remains unchanged because it governs the electric field and is not affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (div B = 0):** In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to reflect the presence of magnetic charge density, such as **div B = ρₘ/μ₀**, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density. Thus, this equation is modified.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction (curl E = -∂B/∂t):** In our universe, this equation describes the relationship between the curl of the electric field and the time-varying magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, if magnetic currents exist, this equation would also change to include a term for the magnetic current density, such as **curl E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ**, where Jₘ is the magnetic current density. Therefore, this equation is modified.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (curl H = ∂D/∂t + Jₑ):** This equation governs the relationship between the curl of the magnetic field and the electric current density. While the presence of magnetic monopoles might introduce magnetic currents, Ampère's law primarily deals with electric currents and displacement currents. Thus, this equation is not directly modified by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

From this analysis, the equations that are different in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:

- **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (div B):** This equation changes due to the presence of magnetic charge density.
- **Faraday's Law (curl E):** This equation changes due to the presence of magnetic current density.

Thus, the correct option is **B**, as it corresponds to the equations related to the circulation of the electric field (Faraday's law) and the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's law for magnetism).
