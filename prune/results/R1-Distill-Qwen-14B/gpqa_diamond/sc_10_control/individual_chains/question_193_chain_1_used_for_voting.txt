Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck on how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/plx^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So if distance increases, parallax decreases. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/r gives me N ∝ (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question asks about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. So I need to find dN/dr.

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But the options don't have a 5, so they're probably looking for the dependence, not the exact coefficient.

Wait no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Oh, maybe it's not the derivative. Because the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps we're thinking about the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a region is a function of the volume, but how? Because stars are spread out in space, so the number density (stars per volume) would matter. But here, the relation is given as N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Since plx = 1/r, this is N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but what is N here? Is N the number of stars per unit volume, or the total number in a volume? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think about how the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would depend on r. So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr, and if the number of stars is proportional to the volume, then N_shell = k * 4π r² dr.

But wait, in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me think: Let's express N in terms of r.

Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So N = K * r^5, where K is some constant.

Wait, but if N is the number per unit volume, then maybe that's different. Wait, no, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is the total number in a sphere of radius r. Because if you have a sphere of radius r, the number of stars would depend on r^5 in this case.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: In astronomy, when you observe stars, the number you see depends on their density and how far away they are. The flux or the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume up to that distance.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this. Let's say the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is dN. The volume of that shell is 4π r² dr. If the number density (stars per unit volume) is n, then dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But according to the question, the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = K * r^5, where K is a constant.

Wait, but if N is the total number of stars up to distance r, then N_total = ∫ n(r') * 4π r'^2 dr' from 0 to r.

But according to the question, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so for each shell, dN = K * r^5 dr? No, that doesn't make sense because integrating r^5 would give a higher dependence. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which would be r^5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But plx = 1/r → plx^5 = 1/r^5 → 1/plx^5 = r^5.

So N ∝ r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr = 5 r^4.

But wait, in the context of stars in a region, the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be proportional to the surface area (4π r²) times the thickness dr, times the number density. But if the number density is n, then dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But according to the given, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number density n(r) is proportional to r^5.

Wait, that would mean n(r) = K r^5.

So then, the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be dN = K r^5 * 4π r² dr = 4π K r^7 dr.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit distance, which is dN/dr. So dN/dr = 4π K r^7 * 1 (since dr is 1).

But that would imply dN/dr is proportional to r^7, which is not one of the options. Hmmm, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars observed is not considering the volume but just the count. Or maybe it's a function of the flux, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given relation N ∝ 1/plx^5 is the total number of stars up to a certain distance. So N_total = K (r)^5.

Then, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be 5 K r^4.

But looking at the options, the options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait, so if the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4, that would be option C, which is r^4.

But wait, the question asks "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, so maybe it's the number per unit distance, so dN/dr.

In that case, if N_total is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because if N is the total number up to r, then dN/dr is the rate at which stars are added per unit distance. So dN/dr = 5 K r^4, so it's proportional to r^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

But wait, another way to think: If N varies as 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, then N = K r^5. So N is the total number of stars up to radius r. So the rate of change (dN/dr) is 5 K r^4, so option C.

So the correct answer should be option C, ~r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/r \)), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars up to a distance \( r \) increases as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( dN/dr \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( dN/dr \propto 5r^4 \). The proportionality \( \propto r^4 \) indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
