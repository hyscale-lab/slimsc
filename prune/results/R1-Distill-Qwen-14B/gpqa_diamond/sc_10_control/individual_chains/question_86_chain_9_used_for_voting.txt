Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Hmm, let's see. The question involves a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and getting specific products. The products are enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with (R) and (S) configurations.

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, and BH3 is also a reducing agent, maybe for different substrates. Oh, wait, no, BH3 is often used for ketones as well, but maybe the reaction conditions or the starting materials matter here. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester or something else.

The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R and the other S. So the configuration of the stereocenter is opposite in each product. That suggests that the starting material must have a certain configuration that would lead to opposite products when reduced with different agents.

Wait, wait, no. The reducing agents might not affect the configuration of the product directly, unless the starting material is a chiral ketone. But wait, in ketone reductions, if the starting ketone is prochiral, the reduction can lead to a chiral center with a specific configuration based on the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, so for ketones, when you reduce them with a hydride agent, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to either R or S configuration. But wait, no, if the ketone is symmetric, the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the starting ketone is chiral, then maybe the configuration of the product depends on the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are not ketones but something else, like esters or amides. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but wait, wait, wait. Let me think about this again.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure is a cyclic ketone, a cyclic hemiacetal or something? Or maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one: pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro means it's a fully saturated ring, so it's a cyclic ether with four CH2 groups and an oxygen. The 2-one means a ketone at position 2. So the structure is a six-membered ring, oxygen at position 1, and a ketone at position 2. And there's an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone or an ester that upon reduction gives this product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Or perhaps they are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides that are being reduced. No, LiBH4 usually doesn't reduce epoxides; that's more for things like H2 and catalysts.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, which upon reduction would open the ester and form a diol, but wait, that doesn't seem to lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones that are being reduced, but that doesn't make sense because a ketone would become a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait a minute, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Because when you reduce an acetal, you can get a carbonyl group. Wait, no, reducing an acetal typically gives an alcohol because the acetal is a protecting group for a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals that upon acid work-up (as in the product equations, which show H+) form the ketone again. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The product is (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the chiral center is at position 2, perhaps. Let's imagine the structure: The ring is O at position 1, then CH2 at 2, which is a carbonyl. Wait, no: tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is O, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. Position 2 has the carbonyl, so it's a cyclic ketone. So the structure is:

O
||
C - (CH2) groups.

Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring where position 2 is the carbonyl, position 4 has an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a certain structure. Let's think about the reaction: when a cyclic ester (lactone) is reduced, perhaps with LiBH4 or BH3, it would open up and form a diol, but that doesn't seem to form a ketone.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals, which upon hydrolysis would give a carbonyl. But the reactions here are with reducing agents, not acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the product.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones with certain protecting groups. For example, if the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something that upon reduction leads to the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal. Let me think: a cyclic ketal would be derived from a diol and a ketone or aldehyde. When you reduce a ketal, you might not get much because ketals are typically stable to reductions. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of alpha-hydroxy esters. When you reduce an ester, it can form a diol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters to the corresponding alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester with a neighboring carbonyl, perhaps the reduction would affect both groups.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are beta-keto esters. Because beta-keto esters can undergo reduction, perhaps with LiBH4 or BH3, in a way that affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then reduction might break it down into a diol, but perhaps in a way that forms a chiral center.

Wait, let me think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has a ketone at position 2, an ethyl group at position 4, and the rest are CH2 groups.

So the ring is six-membered, with O at position 1, ketone at 2, ethyl at 4. So the structure is O in position 1, then positions 2 (C=O), 3, 4 (CH2CH2CH2CH2?), wait, no, ethyl is at 4, which is two carbons away.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that, upon acid treatment, form the pyranone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers that upon some reaction form the ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which upon reduction give the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetal protected ketones. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals that upon reduction give the pyranone. Let me think: Suppose the starting material is a cyclic acetal, like a five-membered ring, and upon reduction, it forms a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and when reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, they open up to form an alcohol. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce epoxides to vicinal diols. But that would give a diol, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers that, upon acid, form the ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the formation of the pyranone via a ring-opening reaction. For example, if the starting material is a gamma-lactone (a five-membered cyclic ester), perhaps upon reduction, it would open into a diol, but then I don't see how that would form a pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones, but I'm stuck.

Wait, I think I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the reactions. For reaction A, the reagent is LiBH4 and H+. For reaction B, it's BH3 and H+.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones and esters. BH3, especially when used with a Lewis acid like THF (as in BH3·THF), is commonly used for the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes, but in some cases, BH3 can reduce esters as well, but maybe under different conditions.

Wait, but if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. Alternatively, using BH3·THF on an ester might not do much, unless under certain conditions, like with H2O or another proton source.

Wait, but the product in both cases is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are not being reduced to a ketone, but perhaps they are being transformed into the ketone via some reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides that, upon acid treatment, undergo ring-opening to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of hemiacetals or acetals that, upon reduction, form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. So, imagine a cyclic ketal derived from a diol and a ketone. When you reduce the ketal, perhaps it opens up and forms a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that would result in the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which, upon reduction, form the pyranone. But reducing a lactone would typically form a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters that, upon ring-opening, form a gamma-hydroxy ester, which then undergoes aldol condensation to form the pyranone. But that seems complicated, and the reactions shown here don't mention any additional reagents beyond the reducing agents and H+.

Hmm, maybe I'm completely off track. Let's think about the configuration again. The products are R and S enantiomers. So the starting materials must have been such that the reduction leads to the opposite configurations when treated with different reagents.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with a certain stereochemistry, and the reducing agents cause different ring-opening paths. For example, BH3 (or other borohydrides) can cause epoxides to open in a certain way, while LiBH4 might do it differently.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then somehow cyclizes into the pyranone. But I'm not clear on the exact mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the configuration of the starting materials. The options given are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a long name. Let me parse that.

3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at position 3 and 5.

At position 3, an ethyl group (-CH2CH2CH3?), wait, 3-ethyl means on the third carbon of the pentanoic acid, which is the third carbon from the COOH group.

At position 5, an isobutoxy group (-O-CH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo group).

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl?

Wait, wait, the formula for 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would be:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH(O-C(CH2CH3)3)-CO-O-isobutyl? Wait, no, wait, pentanoic acid has five carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C(O-isobutyl)

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C(=O)-O-isobutyl

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but correct would be CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait:

The structure is:

CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 COOH ?

Wait, no, wait: Carboxylic acid is at the end, so the carbon chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid: The parent chain is pentanoic acid (5 carbons in total, with the COOH on C-1). So:

C-1: COOH

C-2: CH2

C-3: CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)

C-4: CH2

C-5: C(O-isobutyl)=O (since it's 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy)

Wait, that would make C-5 have both an oxo group and an isobutoxy group. But that's not possible because the same carbon can't have both. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl?

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, since COOH is C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH with ethyl, C4 is CO-O-isobutyl. But that's butanoic acid, not pentanoic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon, which would be carbon 5. So:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O-O-iBu) ?

Wait, but that's only four carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not necessary for solving the problem.

The key point is that the starting materials are (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So they have a chiral center at C3 (due to the ethyl group) and another possible chiral center at C5? Wait, because C5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone. Wait, no, a ketone is a carbonyl, so C5 is a carbonyl carbon, which is trigonal planar, so not a chiral center.

Wait, only C3 is a chiral center because it's attached to four different groups: COOH chain, ethyl, hydrogen, and another carbon? Or is it?

Wait, in 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(=O)-O-isobutyl

Wait, so carbon 3 is connected to:

- Carbon 2 (CH2-)

- Carbon 4 (CH2-)

- Ethyl group (CH2CH3)

- And a hydrogen? Wait, no, in a CH group, it's CH2. Wait, no: structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, that would be four carbons in the chain (since COOH is C1, then CH2, CH(CH2CH3), then CO-O-iBu). But that's four carbons, making it butanoic acid, not pentanoic. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not the main point.

The main point is that when these starting materials are reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, they form the (R) or (S) pyranone.

So, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when you reduce a beta-keto ester with a hydride agent, you can get a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. But then, LiBH4 and BH3 would be involved in that process.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials undergo a reduction that leads to the ring formation.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or a cyclic ether. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-diketones, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals that, upon reduction, form the pyranone. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must have opposite configurations. Let's see the options.

Option D: A is (R), B is (S). Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Because when A is (R) and reacts with LiBH4, it produces (R) product. When B is (S) and reacts with BH3, it produces (S) product.

Wait, no, because the products are (R) and (S). So if starting material A leads to (R) product, and starting material B leads to (S), then perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 could influence the configuration of the product based on the starting material's configuration. But how?

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to either R or S configuration. But if the starting ketone is not chiral, the product would be a racemic mixture. However, if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction could lead to a specific configuration based on the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction leads to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. In that case, the stereochemistry of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, here's a thought: The starting materials are epoxides, and when reduced, they form vicinal diols. The configuration of the diol would depend on the approach of the hydride. Depending on the reducing agent, the stereochemistry of the diol could be different, which would lead to different configurations in the product after cyclization.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would lead to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon acid work-up becomes the pyranone.

Wait, another angle: The starting materials are cyclic acetals or esters that, when reduced, form a diol which undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the diol's configuration, which in turn affects the product's configuration.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

Options A and B have both starting materials as the same enantiomer. Options C and D have A and B as opposite enantiomers.

So, if the starting materials are the same, then why would the products be different? Because they're reduced with different reagents. So, perhaps the reagents cause different stereochemistry in the product, even from the same starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

Wait, I think I need to think about the reaction mechanisms. So, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters to alcohols. But when esters are reduced, it's usually via a two-step process where the ester is first converted to an acid (under acidic conditions), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that, upon reduction, open to form diols. The diol could then cyclize under certain conditions to form the pyranone. The stereochemistry of the starting lactone would influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn affects the product's configuration.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration to form the ketone, but that would require elimination, not reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a neighboring carbonyl group, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of esters to alcohols, and then some kind of cyclization occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation scenario, but that involves base, not reduction.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of each step.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with O at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

If the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, perhaps the reaction forms the ring by connecting certain carbons.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, but that would be an ester if it's an acid. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like:

RC-O-CO-R'

Then, reducing it with LiBH4 or BH3 could lead to different products. But I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a gamma-lactone. When reduced with LiBH4, it would open to form a diol, which then could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, the gamma-lactone would have four members in the ring. Upon reduction with LiBH4, it would form a 1,4-diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form a five-membered ring. But the product is a six-membered ring, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the starting material is a cyclic ester with five members, which upon reduction would form a diol that can cyclize into a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a delta-lactone (five-membered ring). When LiBH4 reduces it, the ester group is converted into a diol, which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not exactly clear on the exact mechanism, but perhaps the key is in the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, another thought: The starting materials are (R) and (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. When treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, the configurations of the resulting product are R and S.

Assuming that the starting material is a chiral beta-keto ester, the reduction would lead to a new chiral center. The configuration of this new center would depend on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, beta-keto esters can undergo reduction to form secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry of the reduction depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is (R), the hydride approach could lead to (R) or (S) in the product, depending on the reagent.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the approach of the hydride in the reduction, leading to different enantiomers.

Wait, if the starting material is (R)-configured, and when reduced with LiBH4, the hydride approaches from the less hindered face, leading to (R) in the product. But when the same starting material is reduced with BH3, the hydride approaches from the opposite face, leading to (S) in the product.

But wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both hydride sources. However, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may have different reaction mechanisms. Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions (like solvent or presence of acid) influence the approach.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the stereochemistry of the product because they approach the carbonyl group from different faces. If the starting material's configuration determines the face from which the hydride approaches, then the product's configuration would depend on both the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent.

But for the given problem, the products are (R) and (S), so one reaction must have given (R) and the other (S). So if A is treated with LiBH4 and gives (R), and B is treated with BH3 and gives (S), then the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

Wait, no. If the same starting material, say (R), when reduced with LiBH4 gives (R), and when reduced with BH3 gives (S), then the starting materials must be the same, but the reagents dictate the product's configuration. But the options don't have the same starting material for A and B except options A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and each reagent reduces them to form opposite configurations. So if A is (R), treated with LiBH4 gives (R) product, and B is (S), treated with BH3 gives (S) product.

Wait, but the products are (R) and (S), so perhaps the starting materials are the opposite enantiomers.

Looking back at the options, option D has A as (R) and B as (S), and option C has A as (S) and B as (R).

So, if the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration, and the reagents determine the approach, perhaps the correct option is where A and B are opposite enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of model reactions.

In the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can approach from either face. If the ketone is prochiral (like acetone), the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the ketone is already chiral, the approach of the hydride can be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to specific diastereomers or enantiomers.

But in this problem, the starting materials are the same molecule but with different configurations. So, if A is (R) and B is (S), and each is reduced with a different hydride reagent, the products would be (R) and (S) respectively.

Wait, but then why would the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs BH3) cause the products to have opposite configurations?

Ah, perhaps because LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and causes the hydride to approach one face, while BH3 under certain conditions approaches the opposite face.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (like acid) influence the approach direction, leading to the opposite configuration when the starting material is an enantiomer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a certain configuration, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol with a specific stereochemistry based on the reagent. Then, upon cyclization, the product's configuration is determined.

But I'm not making much progress on the exact mechanism. Let me think about the possible options.

If the correct answer is option D: A is (R), B is (S), then when A is reduced with LiBH4, it gives the (R) product, and when B is reduced with BH3, it gives the (S) product.

Alternatively, if the starting materials are enantiomers, their reductions might lead to the same product, but that's not the case here.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about how the configuration of the starting material affects the product.

In the reduction of a prochiral ketone, the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the starting ketone is chiral, the product's configuration could be influenced by the starting material's configuration and the approach of the hydride.

Assuming that the starting materials are chiral and their configurations affect the product's configuration when reduced with different agents.

If A is (R) and reduces to (R) product with LiBH4, and B is (S) and reduces to (S) product with BH3, then the correct option would have A and B as opposite enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D has A as (R), B as (S), which fits this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's strength or reaction mechanism leads to opposite configurations when the same enantiomer is used. But the options don't have A and B as the same enantiomer except options A and B.

Wait, but if the starting materials are the same enantiomer, and the reagents cause opposite configurations, then the products would be enantiomers, which is the case here. So, perhaps A and B are the same enantiomer, and the reagents cause the product to form opposite configurations.

But that doesn't fit the options. Because in options A and B, both A and B are same enantiomers. So if option A is both (S), and the reagents cause the product to be R and S, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are the same, and the reagents cause the products to be enantiomers.

Wait, but the problem states that two different reactions were performed on two unknown compounds. So each reaction has a different starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and each leads to the opposite product upon reduction with different reagents.

So, if A is (R) and is reduced with LiBH4 to (R), and B is (S) and is reduced with BH3 to (S), then option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the products to be enantiomers regardless of the starting material, but that's not the case here.

Hmm. I think I've thought this through as much as I can. Given the options, the correct starting materials must be enantiomers, and the correct option is D: A is (R), B is (S).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use two different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key lies in understanding how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a chiral center at position 2. The stereochemistry of this center depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the approach of the hydride during reduction. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which are enantiomers differing in the configuration of the chiral center at position 3.

When a chiral starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. LiBH4 and BH3 may approach the carbonyl group from opposite faces due to differences in reaction mechanisms, leading to products with opposite configurations if the starting materials are enantiomers.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This cannot produce enantiomeric products, as identical starting materials would yield the same product configuration.
- **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Similarly, identical starting materials cannot produce enantiomeric products.
- **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This combination of enantiomeric starting materials could produce enantiomeric products, but the stereochemical outcome depends on the reducing agents.
- **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is the correct combination, as enantiomeric starting materials, when reduced with different reagents, can produce enantiomeric products.

Given that LiBH4 and BH3 likely induce opposite configurations in the product when starting from enantiomeric substrates, the correct answer is **Option D**, where A and B are enantiomers of the starting material.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Hmm, let's see. The question involves a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and getting specific products. The products are enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with (R) and (S) configurations.

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, and BH3 is also a reducing agent, maybe for different substrates. Oh, wait, no, BH3 is often used for ketones as well, but maybe the reaction conditions or the starting materials matter here. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester or something else.

The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R and the other S. So the configuration of the stereocenter is opposite in each product. That suggests that the starting material must have a certain configuration that would lead to opposite products when reduced with different agents.

Wait, wait, no. The reducing agents might not affect the configuration of the product directly, unless the starting material is a chiral ketone. But wait, in ketone reductions, if the starting ketone is prochiral, the reduction can lead to a chiral center with a specific configuration based on the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, so for ketones, when you reduce them with a hydride agent, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to either R or S configuration. But wait, no, if the ketone is symmetric, the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the starting ketone is chiral, then maybe the configuration of the product depends on the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are not ketones but something else, like esters or amides. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but wait, wait, wait. Let me think about this again.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure is a cyclic ketone, a cyclic hemiacetal or something? Or maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one: pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro means it's a fully saturated ring, so it's a cyclic ether with four CH2 groups and an oxygen. The 2-one means a ketone at position 2. So the structure is a six-membered ring, oxygen at position 1, and a ketone at position 2. And there's an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone or an ester that upon reduction gives this product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Or perhaps they are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides that are being reduced. No, LiBH4 usually doesn't reduce epoxides; that's more for things like H2 and catalysts.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, which upon reduction would open the ester and form a diol, but wait, that doesn't seem to lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones that are being reduced, but that doesn't make sense because a ketone would become a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait a minute, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Because when you reduce an acetal, you can get a carbonyl group. Wait, no, reducing an acetal typically gives an alcohol because the acetal is a protecting group for a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals that upon acid work-up (as in the product equations, which show H+) form the ketone again. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The product is (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the chiral center is at position 2, perhaps. Let's imagine the structure: The ring is O at position 1, then CH2 at 2, which is a carbonyl. Wait, no: tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is O, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. Position 2 has the carbonyl, so it's a cyclic ketone. So the structure is:

O
||
C - (CH2) groups.

Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring where position 2 is the carbonyl, position 4 has an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a certain structure. Let's think about the reaction: when a cyclic ester (lactone) is reduced, perhaps with LiBH4 or BH3, it would open up and form a diol, but that doesn't seem to form a ketone.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals, which upon hydrolysis would give a carbonyl. But the reactions here are with reducing agents, not acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the product.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones with certain protecting groups. For example, if the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something that upon reduction leads to the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal. Let me think: a cyclic ketal would be derived from a diol and a ketone or aldehyde. When you reduce a ketal, you might not get much because ketals are typically stable to reductions. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of alpha-hydroxy esters. When you reduce an ester, it can form a diol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters to the corresponding alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester with a neighboring carbonyl, perhaps the reduction would affect both groups.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are beta-keto esters. Because beta-keto esters can undergo reduction, perhaps with LiBH4 or BH3, in a way that affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then reduction might break it down into a diol, but perhaps in a way that forms a chiral center.

Wait, let me think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has a ketone at position 2, an ethyl group at position 4, and the rest are CH2 groups.

So the ring is six-membered, with O at position 1, ketone at 2, ethyl at 4. So the structure is O in position 1, then positions 2 (C=O), 3, 4 (CH2CH2CH2CH2?), wait, no, ethyl is at 4, which is two carbons away.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that, upon acid treatment, form the pyranone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers that upon some reaction form the ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which upon reduction give the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetal protected ketones. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals that upon reduction give the pyranone. Let me think: Suppose the starting material is a cyclic acetal, like a five-membered ring, and upon reduction, it forms a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and when reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, they open up to form an alcohol. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce epoxides to vicinal diols. But that would give a diol, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers that, upon acid, form the ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the formation of the pyranone via a ring-opening reaction. For example, if the starting material is a gamma-lactone (a five-membered cyclic ester), perhaps upon reduction, it would open into a diol, but then I don't see how that would form a pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones, but I'm stuck.

Wait, I think I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the reactions. For reaction A, the reagent is LiBH4 and H+. For reaction B, it's BH3 and H+.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones and esters. BH3, especially when used with a Lewis acid like THF (as in BH3·THF), is commonly used for the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes, but in some cases, BH3 can reduce esters as well, but maybe under different conditions.

Wait, but if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. Alternatively, using BH3·THF on an ester might not do much, unless under certain conditions, like with H2O or another proton source.

Wait, but the product in both cases is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are not being reduced to a ketone, but perhaps they are being transformed into the ketone via some reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides that, upon acid treatment, undergo ring-opening to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of hemiacetals or acetals that, upon reduction, form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. So, imagine a cyclic ketal derived from a diol and a ketone. When you reduce the ketal, perhaps it opens up and forms a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that would result in the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which, upon reduction, form the pyranone. But reducing a lactone would typically form a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters that, upon ring-opening, form a gamma-hydroxy ester, which then undergoes aldol condensation to form the pyranone. But that seems complicated, and the reactions shown here don't mention any additional reagents beyond the reducing agents and H+.

Hmm, maybe I'm completely off track. Let's think about the configuration again. The products are R and S enantiomers. So the starting materials must have been such that the reduction leads to the opposite configurations when treated with different reagents.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with a certain stereochemistry, and the reducing agents cause different ring-opening paths. For example, BH3 (or other borohydrides) can cause epoxides to open in a certain way, while LiBH4 might do it differently.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then somehow cyclizes into the pyranone. But I'm not clear on the exact mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the configuration of the starting materials. The options given are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a long name. Let me parse that.

3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at position 3 and 5.

At position 3, an ethyl group (-CH2CH2CH3?), wait, 3-ethyl means on the third carbon of the pentanoic acid, which is the third carbon from the COOH group.

At position 5, an isobutoxy group (-O-CH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo group).

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl?

Wait, wait, the formula for 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would be:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH(O-C(CH2CH3)3)-CO-O-isobutyl? Wait, no, wait, pentanoic acid has five carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C(O-isobutyl)

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C(=O)-O-isobutyl

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but correct would be CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait:

The structure is:

CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 COOH ?

Wait, no, wait: Carboxylic acid is at the end, so the carbon chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid: The parent chain is pentanoic acid (5 carbons in total, with the COOH on C-1). So:

C-1: COOH

C-2: CH2

C-3: CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)

C-4: CH2

C-5: C(O-isobutyl)=O (since it's 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy)

Wait, that would make C-5 have both an oxo group and an isobutoxy group. But that's not possible because the same carbon can't have both. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl?

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, since COOH is C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH with ethyl, C4 is CO-O-isobutyl. But that's butanoic acid, not pentanoic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon, which would be carbon 5. So:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O-O-iBu) ?

Wait, but that's only four carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not necessary for solving the problem.

The key point is that the starting materials are (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So they have a chiral center at C3 (due to the ethyl group) and another possible chiral center at C5? Wait, because C5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone. Wait, no, a ketone is a carbonyl, so C5 is a carbonyl carbon, which is trigonal planar, so not a chiral center.

Wait, only C3 is a chiral center because it's attached to four different groups: COOH chain, ethyl, hydrogen, and another carbon? Or is it?

Wait, in 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(=O)-O-isobutyl

Wait, so carbon 3 is connected to:

- Carbon 2 (CH2-)

- Carbon 4 (CH2-)

- Ethyl group (CH2CH3)

- And a hydrogen? Wait, no, in a CH group, it's CH2. Wait, no: structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, that would be four carbons in the chain (since COOH is C1, then CH2, CH(CH2CH3), then CO-O-iBu). But that's four carbons, making it butanoic acid, not pentanoic. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not the main point.

The main point is that when these starting materials are reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, they form the (R) or (S) pyranone.

So, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when you reduce a beta-keto ester with a hydride agent, you can get a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. But then, LiBH4 and BH3 would be involved in that process.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials undergo a reduction that leads to the ring formation.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or a cyclic ether. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-diketones, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals that, upon reduction, form the pyranone. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must have opposite configurations. Let's see the options.

Option D: A is (R), B is (S). Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Because when A is (R) and reacts with LiBH4, it produces (R) product. When B is (S) and reacts with BH3, it produces (S) product.

Wait, no, because the products are (R) and (S). So if starting material A leads to (R) product, and starting material B leads to (S), then perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 could influence the configuration of the product based on the starting material's configuration. But how?

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to either R or S configuration. But if the starting ketone is not chiral, the product would be a racemic mixture. However, if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction could lead to a specific configuration based on the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction leads to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. In that case, the stereochemistry of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, here's a thought: The starting materials are epoxides, and when reduced, they form vicinal diols. The configuration of the diol would depend on the approach of the hydride. Depending on the reducing agent, the stereochemistry of the diol could be different, which would lead to different configurations in the product after cyclization.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would lead to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon acid work-up becomes the pyranone.

Wait, another angle: The starting materials are cyclic acetals or esters that, when reduced, form a diol which undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the diol's configuration, which in turn affects the product's configuration.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

Options A and B have both starting materials as the same enantiomer. Options C and D have A and B as opposite enantiomers.

So, if the starting materials are the same, then why would the products be different? Because they're reduced with different reagents. So, perhaps the reagents cause different stereochemistry in the product, even from the same starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

Wait, I think I need to think about the reaction mechanisms. So, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters to alcohols. But when esters are reduced, it's usually via a two-step process where the ester is first converted to an acid (under acidic conditions), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that, upon reduction, open to form diols. The diol could then cyclize under certain conditions to form the pyranone. The stereochemistry of the starting lactone would influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn affects the product's configuration.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration to form the ketone, but that would require elimination, not reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a neighboring carbonyl group, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of esters to alcohols, and then some kind of cyclization occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation scenario, but that involves base, not reduction.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of each step.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with O at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

If the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, perhaps the reaction forms the ring by connecting certain carbons.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, but that would be an ester if it's an acid. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like:

RC-O-CO-R'

Then, reducing it with LiBH4 or BH3 could lead to different products. But I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a gamma-lactone. When reduced with LiBH4, it would open to form a diol, which then could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, the gamma-lactone would have four members in the ring. Upon reduction with LiBH4, it would form a 1,4-diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form a five-membered ring. But the product is a six-membered ring, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the starting material is a cyclic ester with five members, which upon reduction would form a diol that can cyclize into a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a delta-lactone (five-membered ring). When LiBH4 reduces it, the ester group is converted into a diol, which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the pyranone.

But I'm not exactly clear on the exact mechanism, but perhaps the key is in the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, another thought: The starting materials are (R) and (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. When treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, the configurations of the resulting product are R and S.

Assuming that the starting material is a chiral beta-keto ester, the reduction would lead to a new chiral center. The configuration of this new center would depend on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, beta-keto esters can undergo reduction to form secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry of the reduction depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is (R), the hydride approach could lead to (R) or (S) in the product, depending on the reagent.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the approach of the hydride in the reduction, leading to different enantiomers.

Wait, if the starting material is (R)-configured, and when reduced with LiBH4, the hydride approaches from the less hindered face, leading to (R) in the product. But when the same starting material is reduced with BH3, the hydride approaches from the opposite face, leading to (S) in the product.

But wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both hydride sources. However, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may have different reaction mechanisms. Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions (like solvent or presence of acid) influence the approach.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the stereochemistry of the product because they approach the carbonyl group from different faces. If the starting material's configuration determines the face from which the hydride approaches, then the product's configuration would depend on both the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent.

But for the given problem, the products are (R) and (S), so one reaction must have given (R) and the other (S). So if A is treated with LiBH4 and gives (R), and B is treated with BH3 and gives (S), then the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

Wait, no. If the same starting material, say (R), when reduced with LiBH4 gives (R), and when reduced with BH3 gives (S), then the starting materials must be the same, but the reagents dictate the product's configuration. But the options don't have the same starting material for A and B except options A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and each reagent reduces them to form opposite configurations. So if A is (R), treated with LiBH4 gives (R) product, and B is (S), treated with BH3 gives (S) product.

Wait, but the products are (R) and (S), so perhaps the starting materials are the opposite enantiomers.

Looking back at the options, option D has A as (R) and B as (S), and option C has A as (S) and B as (R).

So, if the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration, and the reagents determine the approach, perhaps the correct option is where A and B are opposite enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of model reactions.

In the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can approach from either face. If the ketone is prochiral (like acetone), the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the ketone is already chiral, the approach of the hydride can be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to specific diastereomers or enantiomers.

But in this problem, the starting materials are the same molecule but with different configurations. So, if A is (R) and B is (S), and each is reduced with a different hydride reagent, the products would be (R) and (S) respectively.

Wait, but then why would the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs BH3) cause the products to have opposite configurations?

Ah, perhaps because LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and causes the hydride to approach one face, while BH3 under certain conditions approaches the opposite face.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (like acid) influence the approach direction, leading to the opposite configuration when the starting material is an enantiomer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a certain configuration, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol with a specific stereochemistry based on the reagent. Then, upon cyclization, the product's configuration is determined.

But I'm not making much progress on the exact mechanism. Let me think about the possible options.

If the correct answer is option D: A is (R), B is (S), then when A is reduced with LiBH4, it gives the (R) product, and when B is reduced with BH3, it gives the (S) product.

Alternatively, if the starting materials are enantiomers, their reductions might lead to the same product, but that's not the case here.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about how the configuration of the starting material affects the product.

In the reduction of a prochiral ketone, the product would be a racemic mixture. But if the starting ketone is chiral, the product's configuration could be influenced by the starting material's configuration and the approach of the hydride.

Assuming that the starting materials are chiral and their configurations affect the product's configuration when reduced with different agents.

If A is (R) and reduces to (R) product with LiBH4, and B is (S) and reduces to (S) product with BH3, then the correct option would have A and B as opposite enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D has A as (R), B as (S), which fits this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's strength or reaction mechanism leads to opposite configurations when the same enantiomer is used. But the options don't have A and B as the same enantiomer except options A and B.

Wait, but if the starting materials are the same enantiomer, and the reagents cause opposite configurations, then the products would be enantiomers, which is the case here. So, perhaps A and B are the same enantiomer, and the reagents cause the product to form opposite configurations.

But that doesn't fit the options. Because in options A and B, both A and B are same enantiomers. So if option A is both (S), and the reagents cause the product to be R and S, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are the same, and the reagents cause the products to be enantiomers.

Wait, but the problem states that two different reactions were performed on two unknown compounds. So each reaction has a different starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and each leads to the opposite product upon reduction with different reagents.

So, if A is (R) and is reduced with LiBH4 to (R), and B is (S) and is reduced with BH3 to (S), then option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the products to be enantiomers regardless of the starting material, but that's not the case here.

Hmm. I think I've thought this through as much as I can. Given the options, the correct starting materials must be enantiomers, and the correct option is D: A is (R), B is (S).


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use two different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key lies in understanding how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a chiral center at position 2. The stereochemistry of this center depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the approach of the hydride during reduction. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which are enantiomers differing in the configuration of the chiral center at position 3.

When a chiral starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. LiBH4 and BH3 may approach the carbonyl group from opposite faces due to differences in reaction mechanisms, leading to products with opposite configurations if the starting materials are enantiomers.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This cannot produce enantiomeric products, as identical starting materials would yield the same product configuration.
- **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Similarly, identical starting materials cannot produce enantiomeric products.
- **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This combination of enantiomeric starting materials could produce enantiomeric products, but the stereochemical outcome depends on the reducing agents.
- **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is the correct combination, as enantiomeric starting materials, when reduced with different reagents, can produce enantiomeric products.

Given that LiBH4 and BH3 likely induce opposite configurations in the product when starting from enantiomeric substrates, the correct answer is **Option D**, where A and B are enantiomers of the starting material.

Answer: D
