Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so they're both scaled up by the same factor in radius and mass. But wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context, unless it's about something else like temperature or something else. But the problem says they radiate as black bodies, so I guess I should focus on the blackbody radiation formulas.

The astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found them the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's useful.

Next, they calculated the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity... that's the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, Doppler shift! The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength would be different from the actual emitted one.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted peak λ is shifted, but the observed λ is the same as Star_1's. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

So let me think: Star_1 isn't moving (radial velocity 0), so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards or away from us. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but I might have the formula a bit wrong. Alternatively, the formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), but that's a linear approximation. However, since v_r is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s), maybe the relativistic Doppler shift is needed.

Wait, the exact Doppler shift formula is a bit complicated. Let me recall. For the Doppler effect when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed wavelength λ' is given by:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving away, v is positive, and that would make λ' longer (redshift). If it's moving towards, v is negative, so λ' is shorter (blueshift). But in our case, Star_2's observed peak λ is the same as Star_1's, which is emitted at λ_max (since Star_1 isn't moving). So Star_2's emitted peak must be shifted such that when we apply the Doppler shift, we get the same λ_max as Star_1.

Wait, but let me get this straight. Let me denote:

For Star_1: No radial velocity (v1 = 0), so λ1_emit = λ1_obs = λ_max.

For Star_2: It has a radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so v2 is positive. Then, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we have λ2_emit = λ1_obs / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ1_obs is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, which is λ1_emit = b / T1. Similarly, λ2_emit = b / T2. Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because λ1_emit = λ2_emit? No, wait, no. Because Star_2's λ2_emit is different, but when observed, it's shifted to λ2_obs, which equals λ1_obs.

Wait, no. Let me re-express this.

From the problem statement, the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same when observed. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since its radial velocity is zero).

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Thus:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So, λ2_emit = λ1_emit / Doppler factor.

But since λ = b / T, then T2_emit = T1_emit * Doppler factor.

Wait, no, let's see:

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So, if λ1_emit = λ2_obs, and λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor, then:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Which gives (b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

Which would mean T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), which is greater than 1 if v is positive (moving away). So T2 would be higher than T1 if Star_2 is moving away, because Doppler factor is greater than 1. Wait, let me see.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me rephrase:

We have for Star_2, the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

But since λ2_obs = λ1_emit (because they have the same observed brightness peak), we can write:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Cancel out the b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

=> T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But since v_r is positive (if moving away), the term inside the square root is greater than 1, so T2 > T1.

Wait, but that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, does that make sense? Because if Star_2 is moving away, then from our perspective, its light is redshifted. So the peak wavelength we observe is longer. But if the peak wavelengths observed are the same for both stars, then Star_2 must have a higher temperature (to emit a shorter wavelength, which when redshifted, appears the same as Star_1's longer wavelength. Hmm, perhaps I should think it through with an example.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as: Star_2's emitted light is redshifted. So when observed, its peak is at the same wavelength as Star_1's, which isn't moving. So the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter (because when redshifted, it becomes the same as Star_1's longer wavelength). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if a star is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted. So the peak wavelength observed is longer. But we're told that both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So Star_2, which is moving away, emits at a shorter wavelength. Because when you redshift it, it becomes the same λ_max as Star_1.

So, Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than Star_1's emitted λ. But because of the Doppler shift, when observed, both have the same λ_max.

So, let me compute the Doppler shift factor.

v = 700 km/s. c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So, the Doppler shift factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Plugging in the numbers:

(1+0.002333)/(1-0.002333) = (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.0047.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately.

1.002333 / 0.997667 = Let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.002333.

Denominator: 0.997667.

Dividing them: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047.

So sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.00235.

Wait, because sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x. Here x is about 0.0047, so x/2 is about 0.00235. So the square root is approximately 1.00235.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00235. So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor ≈ T1 * 1.00235.

Wait, but wait, earlier from the equation:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2 is about 1.00235 * T1.

Hmm. So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

Wait, but why? Because from our perspective, Star_2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. But since the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_2 must have a higher temperature. Because T is inversely proportional to λ. So if Star_2's emitted λ is smaller (bluer), then T is higher. When you redshift it, the observed λ becomes larger (red), matching Star_1's.

So now, the temperatures are T1 and T2 = T1 * 1.00235 approximately.

Now, the problem is about the luminosities. The luminosity of a star (assuming blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since we're comparing the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, the 4π and σ terms will cancel out when taking the ratio. So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R2 = R1 / 1.5.

Wait, no: R1 = 1.5 R2 => R2 = R1 / 1.5. So R1² / R2² = (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

So the R² term gives 2.25.

Now, the T term is T1⁴ / T2⁴.

Earlier, we found that T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00235. So T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 1.00235 ≈ 0.99766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4.

Let me compute that. (0.99766)^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00234 = 0.99532. Then, squaring that again: (0.99532)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00468)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 *0.00468 = 0.99064.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 0.99766^4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (1 / 1.00235)^4.

1.00235 is approximately 1 + 0.00235. So 1/(1.00235) ≈ 1 - 0.00235 + (0.00235)^2 - ... So approximately 0.99766.

But perhaps I should just compute (0.99766)^4.

Alternatively, using T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ?

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck in the calculations, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler factor.

Wait, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) = sqrt(1.004666/0.997667) = sqrt(1.007049) ≈ 1.00352.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.0023333...

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333.

1 - v/c = 0.9976667.

So (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) = let's compute that.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to make it easier: 1002333.3 / 997666.7 ≈ (approx 1002333.3 ÷ 997666.7).

Let me compute that division:

997666.7 * 1.0047 ≈ 997666.7 + (997666.7 * 0.0047) ≈ 997666.7 + approx 4688.35 ≈ 1,002,355.05.

But the numerator is 1,002,333.3. So 1.0047 would give 1,002,355, which is a bit higher than 1,002,333. So perhaps the ratio is about 1.00466 instead.

So sqrt(1.00466) ≈ Let me compute that.

We know that sqrt(1.00466) is about 1.002325, because (1.002325)^2 ≈ 1.00466.

Because (1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2. For x=0.002325, 2x=0.00465, which is close to 0.00466.

So sqrt(1.00466)= approx 1.002325.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.002325.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002325.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002325 ≈ 0.99768.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me compute (0.99768)^2 first.

0.99768^2 = (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 = 0.99536.

But more accurately, (0.99768)^2 = 0.99768 * 0.99768.

Let me compute:

0.99768 * 0.99768.

Approximate:

= (1 - 0.00232) * (1 - 0.00232) = 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.99536538.

So (0.99768)^2 ≈ 0.995365.

Now, compute (0.995365)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004635 + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.0000214 ≈ 0.99075.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, putting it all together:

L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99075.

Let me calculate:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So 2.2275 + 0.0016875 = approx 2.2291875.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 * 0.99075 more accurately.

Alternatively, 2.25 * 0.99075 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So adding them, 2.2275 + 0.0016875 = 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.229. So L1 is about 2.23 times L2.

Wait, but let's check the options. Option D is ~2.23, and option C is ~2.35. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the T ratio.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the T ratio. Because earlier, T2 is T1 * Doppler factor, which was approximately 1.002325.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002325.

So when computing T1^4 / T2^4, it's (T1/T2)^4 = (1/1.002325)^4 ≈ (0.997678)^4.

Wait, earlier I computed that as approximately 0.99075. Let me confirm that.

0.997678^2 = ?

Well, 0.997678 * 0.997678.

= (1 - 0.002322)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002322 = 0.995356.

Then, (0.995356)^2 = (approx 0.99075).

So yes, that part is correct.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So our calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is closest to option D, ~2.23.

But wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation of the Doppler shift factor because earlier, I might have approximated too much.

Let me compute the Doppler shift factor exactly.

v =700 km/s. c=3e5 km/s.

v/c =700 / 3e5= 0.00233333333.

So (1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

Ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = 1.002333333 / 0.997666667 = let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute this division:

1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667 = ?

Let me compute it numerically.

Let me write this as:

n = 1.002333333.

d = 0.997666667.

Compute n/d.

Let me compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Well, 0.997666667 is approximately 0.9976667.

So, 1.002333333 / 0.9976667 = ?

Let me compute 0.9976667 * 1.005 = ?

0.9976667 * 1.005 = 0.9976667 * (1 + 0.005) = 0.9976667 + 0.0049883335 = 1.0026550335.

That's higher than 1.002333333. So 1.005 gives a product higher than n. Let's try 1.004.

0.9976667 * 1.004 = 0.9976667 * (1 +0.004) = 0.9976667 + 0.0039906668 = 1.001657367.

Still lower than n=1.002333333.

How about 1.0045.

0.9976667 * 1.0045 = ?

0.9976667 * 1.0045 = 0.9976667 * 1 + 0.9976667 * 0.0045.

= 0.9976667 + (0.9976667 *0.0045).

Compute 0.9976667 *0.0045.

0.0045 *1=0.0045.

0.0045 *0.9976667 ≈ 0.0044900005.

So total is 0.9976667 + 0.0044900005 = 1.0021567.

Closer to 1.002333333.

The difference between 1.0021567 and 1.002333333 is 0.000176633.

How much more do we need to add to 1.0045 to get that extra.

At x=1.0045 + delta, the product is approximately 0.9976667 * (1.0045 + delta) = 1.0021567 + 0.9976667 * delta.

Set this equal to 1.002333333.

So 1.0021567 + 0.9976667 * delta = 1.002333333.

So 0.9976667 * delta = 0.000176633.

So delta = 0.000176633 / 0.9976667 ≈ 0.00017705.

So x ≈ 1.0045 + 0.00017705 ≈ 1.00467705.

So the ratio is approximately 1.004677.

Thus, the Doppler factor sqrt(1.004677) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(1.004677).

We can write this as sqrt(1 + 0.004677).

Using the Taylor expansion sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/(8) for small x.

x=0.004677.

So sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.004677/2 - (0.004677)^2 /8.

Compute each term:

0.004677/2 = 0.0023385.

(0.004677)^2 = approx 0.00002187 (since 0.004^2=0.000016, 0.0046^2=0.00002116).

So (0.004677)^2 = approx 0.00002187.

Divided by 8: 0.00002187 /8 ≈ 0.000002734.

So sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.0023385 - 0.000002734 ≈ 1.002335766.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.0023358.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0023358.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023358 ≈ 0.997668.

Now, compute (T1/T2)^4.

= (0.997668)^4.

Let me compute this accurately.

First, compute (0.997668)^2.

0.997668^2 = ?

Compute 0.997668 * 0.997668.

= (1 - 0.002332)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.002332 + (0.002332)^2.

= 1 - 0.004664 + 0.000005435.

= 0.995341435.

Now, compute (0.995341435)^2.

= (1 - 0.004658565)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.004658565 + (0.004658565)^2.

Approximately:

= 1 - 0.00931713 + 0.0000217.

= 0.99068457.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99068457.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So, 2.25 * 0.99068457 = ?

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99068457 = 2.25 * (1 - 0.00931543) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.00931543).

2.25 * 0.00931543 = approximately 0.0209225.

So 2.25 - 0.0209225 = 2.2290775.

Approximately 2.229.

So, the ratio L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this value.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and blackbody radiation principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 \, M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity in this context)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \)

2. **Blackbody Radiation**:
   - Luminosity: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \)
   - Peak wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \) (Wien's law)

### Step 1: Temperature Relationship
Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \)), the emitted wavelengths must differ due to the Doppler effect. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted because \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (positive for motion away from the observer). Thus:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2, emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
Rearranging and using \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), we find:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
Substituting \( v/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.00466, \quad \sqrt{1.00466} \approx 1.00233
\]
Thus:
\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]
\[
T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Taking the ratio of luminosities:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = 2.25 \), and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]
First, compute \( \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \):
\[
\left( 0.99767 \right)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad \left( 0.99534 \right)^2 \approx 0.99073
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99073 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times that of Star_2. Comparing with the options:
- A) ~2.25
- B) ~2.32
- C) ~2.35
- D) ~2.23

The closest match is **D) ~2.23**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so they're both scaled up by the same factor in radius and mass. But wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context, unless it's about something else like temperature or something else. But the problem says they radiate as black bodies, so I guess I should focus on the blackbody radiation formulas.

The astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found them the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's useful.

Next, they calculated the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity... that's the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, Doppler shift! The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength would be different from the actual emitted one.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted peak λ is shifted, but the observed λ is the same as Star_1's. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

So let me think: Star_1 isn't moving (radial velocity 0), so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards or away from us. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but I might have the formula a bit wrong. Alternatively, the formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), but that's a linear approximation. However, since v_r is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s), maybe the relativistic Doppler shift is needed.

Wait, the exact Doppler shift formula is a bit complicated. Let me recall. For the Doppler effect when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed wavelength λ' is given by:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving away, v is positive, and that would make λ' longer (redshift). If it's moving towards, v is negative, so λ' is shorter (blueshift). But in our case, Star_2's observed peak λ is the same as Star_1's, which is emitted at λ_max (since Star_1 isn't moving). So Star_2's emitted peak must be shifted such that when we apply the Doppler shift, we get the same λ_max as Star_1.

Wait, but let me get this straight. Let me denote:

For Star_1: No radial velocity (v1 = 0), so λ1_emit = λ1_obs = λ_max.

For Star_2: It has a radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so v2 is positive. Then, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we have λ2_emit = λ1_obs / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ1_obs is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, which is λ1_emit = b / T1. Similarly, λ2_emit = b / T2. Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because λ1_emit = λ2_emit? No, wait, no. Because Star_2's λ2_emit is different, but when observed, it's shifted to λ2_obs, which equals λ1_obs.

Wait, no. Let me re-express this.

From the problem statement, the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same when observed. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since its radial velocity is zero).

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Thus:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So, λ2_emit = λ1_emit / Doppler factor.

But since λ = b / T, then T2_emit = T1_emit * Doppler factor.

Wait, no, let's see:

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So, if λ1_emit = λ2_obs, and λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor, then:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Which gives (b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

Which would mean T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), which is greater than 1 if v is positive (moving away). So T2 would be higher than T1 if Star_2 is moving away, because Doppler factor is greater than 1. Wait, let me see.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me rephrase:

We have for Star_2, the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

But since λ2_obs = λ1_emit (because they have the same observed brightness peak), we can write:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Cancel out the b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

=> T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But since v_r is positive (if moving away), the term inside the square root is greater than 1, so T2 > T1.

Wait, but that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, does that make sense? Because if Star_2 is moving away, then from our perspective, its light is redshifted. So the peak wavelength we observe is longer. But if the peak wavelengths observed are the same for both stars, then Star_2 must have a higher temperature (to emit a shorter wavelength, which when redshifted, appears the same as Star_1's longer wavelength. Hmm, perhaps I should think it through with an example.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as: Star_2's emitted light is redshifted. So when observed, its peak is at the same wavelength as Star_1's, which isn't moving. So the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter (because when redshifted, it becomes the same as Star_1's longer wavelength). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if a star is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted. So the peak wavelength observed is longer. But we're told that both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So Star_2, which is moving away, emits at a shorter wavelength. Because when you redshift it, it becomes the same λ_max as Star_1.

So, Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than Star_1's emitted λ. But because of the Doppler shift, when observed, both have the same λ_max.

So, let me compute the Doppler shift factor.

v = 700 km/s. c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So, the Doppler shift factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Plugging in the numbers:

(1+0.002333)/(1-0.002333) = (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.0047.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately.

1.002333 / 0.997667 = Let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.002333.

Denominator: 0.997667.

Dividing them: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047.

So sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.00235.

Wait, because sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x. Here x is about 0.0047, so x/2 is about 0.00235. So the square root is approximately 1.00235.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00235. So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor ≈ T1 * 1.00235.

Wait, but wait, earlier from the equation:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2 is about 1.00235 * T1.

Hmm. So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

Wait, but why? Because from our perspective, Star_2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. But since the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_2 must have a higher temperature. Because T is inversely proportional to λ. So if Star_2's emitted λ is smaller (bluer), then T is higher. When you redshift it, the observed λ becomes larger (red), matching Star_1's.

So now, the temperatures are T1 and T2 = T1 * 1.00235 approximately.

Now, the problem is about the luminosities. The luminosity of a star (assuming blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since we're comparing the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, the 4π and σ terms will cancel out when taking the ratio. So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R2 = R1 / 1.5.

Wait, no: R1 = 1.5 R2 => R2 = R1 / 1.5. So R1² / R2² = (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

So the R² term gives 2.25.

Now, the T term is T1⁴ / T2⁴.

Earlier, we found that T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00235. So T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 1.00235 ≈ 0.99766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4.

Let me compute that. (0.99766)^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00234 = 0.99532. Then, squaring that again: (0.99532)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00468)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 *0.00468 = 0.99064.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 0.99766^4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (1 / 1.00235)^4.

1.00235 is approximately 1 + 0.00235. So 1/(1.00235) ≈ 1 - 0.00235 + (0.00235)^2 - ... So approximately 0.99766.

But perhaps I should just compute (0.99766)^4.

Alternatively, using T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ?

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck in the calculations, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler factor.

Wait, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) = sqrt(1.004666/0.997667) = sqrt(1.007049) ≈ 1.00352.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.0023333...

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333.

1 - v/c = 0.9976667.

So (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) = let's compute that.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to make it easier: 1002333.3 / 997666.7 ≈ (approx 1002333.3 ÷ 997666.7).

Let me compute that division:

997666.7 * 1.0047 ≈ 997666.7 + (997666.7 * 0.0047) ≈ 997666.7 + approx 4688.35 ≈ 1,002,355.05.

But the numerator is 1,002,333.3. So 1.0047 would give 1,002,355, which is a bit higher than 1,002,333. So perhaps the ratio is about 1.00466 instead.

So sqrt(1.00466) ≈ Let me compute that.

We know that sqrt(1.00466) is about 1.002325, because (1.002325)^2 ≈ 1.00466.

Because (1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2. For x=0.002325, 2x=0.00465, which is close to 0.00466.

So sqrt(1.00466)= approx 1.002325.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.002325.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002325.

Thus, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002325 ≈ 0.99768.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me compute (0.99768)^2 first.

0.99768^2 = (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 = 0.99536.

But more accurately, (0.99768)^2 = 0.99768 * 0.99768.

Let me compute:

0.99768 * 0.99768.

Approximate:

= (1 - 0.00232) * (1 - 0.00232) = 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.99536538.

So (0.99768)^2 ≈ 0.995365.

Now, compute (0.995365)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004635 + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.0000214 ≈ 0.99075.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, putting it all together:

L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99075.

Let me calculate:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So 2.2275 + 0.0016875 = approx 2.2291875.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 * 0.99075 more accurately.

Alternatively, 2.25 * 0.99075 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So adding them, 2.2275 + 0.0016875 = 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.229. So L1 is about 2.23 times L2.

Wait, but let's check the options. Option D is ~2.23, and option C is ~2.35. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the T ratio.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the T ratio. Because earlier, T2 is T1 * Doppler factor, which was approximately 1.002325.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002325.

So when computing T1^4 / T2^4, it's (T1/T2)^4 = (1/1.002325)^4 ≈ (0.997678)^4.

Wait, earlier I computed that as approximately 0.99075. Let me confirm that.

0.997678^2 = ?

Well, 0.997678 * 0.997678.

= (1 - 0.002322)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002322 = 0.995356.

Then, (0.995356)^2 = (approx 0.99075).

So yes, that part is correct.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So our calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is closest to option D, ~2.23.

But wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation of the Doppler shift factor because earlier, I might have approximated too much.

Let me compute the Doppler shift factor exactly.

v =700 km/s. c=3e5 km/s.

v/c =700 / 3e5= 0.00233333333.

So (1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

Ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = 1.002333333 / 0.997666667 = let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute this division:

1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667 = ?

Let me compute it numerically.

Let me write this as:

n = 1.002333333.

d = 0.997666667.

Compute n/d.

Let me compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Well, 0.997666667 is approximately 0.9976667.

So, 1.002333333 / 0.9976667 = ?

Let me compute 0.9976667 * 1.005 = ?

0.9976667 * 1.005 = 0.9976667 * (1 + 0.005) = 0.9976667 + 0.0049883335 = 1.0026550335.

That's higher than 1.002333333. So 1.005 gives a product higher than n. Let's try 1.004.

0.9976667 * 1.004 = 0.9976667 * (1 +0.004) = 0.9976667 + 0.0039906668 = 1.001657367.

Still lower than n=1.002333333.

How about 1.0045.

0.9976667 * 1.0045 = ?

0.9976667 * 1.0045 = 0.9976667 * 1 + 0.9976667 * 0.0045.

= 0.9976667 + (0.9976667 *0.0045).

Compute 0.9976667 *0.0045.

0.0045 *1=0.0045.

0.0045 *0.9976667 ≈ 0.0044900005.

So total is 0.9976667 + 0.0044900005 = 1.0021567.

Closer to 1.002333333.

The difference between 1.0021567 and 1.002333333 is 0.000176633.

How much more do we need to add to 1.0045 to get that extra.

At x=1.0045 + delta, the product is approximately 0.9976667 * (1.0045 + delta) = 1.0021567 + 0.9976667 * delta.

Set this equal to 1.002333333.

So 1.0021567 + 0.9976667 * delta = 1.002333333.

So 0.9976667 * delta = 0.000176633.

So delta = 0.000176633 / 0.9976667 ≈ 0.00017705.

So x ≈ 1.0045 + 0.00017705 ≈ 1.00467705.

So the ratio is approximately 1.004677.

Thus, the Doppler factor sqrt(1.004677) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(1.004677).

We can write this as sqrt(1 + 0.004677).

Using the Taylor expansion sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/(8) for small x.

x=0.004677.

So sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.004677/2 - (0.004677)^2 /8.

Compute each term:

0.004677/2 = 0.0023385.

(0.004677)^2 = approx 0.00002187 (since 0.004^2=0.000016, 0.0046^2=0.00002116).

So (0.004677)^2 = approx 0.00002187.

Divided by 8: 0.00002187 /8 ≈ 0.000002734.

So sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.0023385 - 0.000002734 ≈ 1.002335766.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.0023358.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0023358.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023358 ≈ 0.997668.

Now, compute (T1/T2)^4.

= (0.997668)^4.

Let me compute this accurately.

First, compute (0.997668)^2.

0.997668^2 = ?

Compute 0.997668 * 0.997668.

= (1 - 0.002332)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.002332 + (0.002332)^2.

= 1 - 0.004664 + 0.000005435.

= 0.995341435.

Now, compute (0.995341435)^2.

= (1 - 0.004658565)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.004658565 + (0.004658565)^2.

Approximately:

= 1 - 0.00931713 + 0.0000217.

= 0.99068457.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99068457.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So, 2.25 * 0.99068457 = ?

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99068457 = 2.25 * (1 - 0.00931543) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.00931543).

2.25 * 0.00931543 = approximately 0.0209225.

So 2.25 - 0.0209225 = 2.2290775.

Approximately 2.229.

So, the ratio L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this value.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and blackbody radiation principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 \, M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity in this context)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \)

2. **Blackbody Radiation**:
   - Luminosity: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \)
   - Peak wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \) (Wien's law)

### Step 1: Temperature Relationship
Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \)), the emitted wavelengths must differ due to the Doppler effect. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted because \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (positive for motion away from the observer). Thus:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2, emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
Rearranging and using \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), we find:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
Substituting \( v/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.00466, \quad \sqrt{1.00466} \approx 1.00233
\]
Thus:
\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]
\[
T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Taking the ratio of luminosities:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = 2.25 \), and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]
First, compute \( \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \):
\[
\left( 0.99767 \right)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad \left( 0.99534 \right)^2 \approx 0.99073
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99073 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
