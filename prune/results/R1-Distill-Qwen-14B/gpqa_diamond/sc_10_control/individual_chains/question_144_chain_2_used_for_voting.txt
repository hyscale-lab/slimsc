Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think this through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula that connects these is something like the mean distance L = v * τ * c, where v is the velocity, τ is the lifetime, and c is the speed of light. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I recall that the decay length can be calculated using the relation L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, because the lifetime observed is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma.

So the proper lifetime τ0 is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ0. So τ0 = ħ / Γ. But wait, let me check the units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ0 would be ħ divided by Γ. Let me convert ΓX to GeV. Oh right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime is τ = γ τ0, where γ is the Lorentz factor. To find γ, I need the particle's energy and mass.

The energy EX is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The Lorentz factor γ is E / (m c²) but since E is given in energy terms, I think E = γ m c². So γ = E / m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So γ is 6.6667, so τ = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.3711e-23 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is β c, and β = v/c. The velocity can be found using the relation between energy and momentum. Because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² = 64 (GeV)^2, (m c²)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

But wait, maybe I should calculate β using the relation β = (pc²)/(E). Because E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, so β = v/c = (p c)/(E).

So, with p c being 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so β = 7.91 / 8 = approximately 0.98875.

So β is about 0.98875. Therefore, v is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. Wait, no, because τ is the lifetime in the lab frame, so L = v * τ = β c * τ.

So putting it all together:

L = β c τ = β c γ τ0.

Wait, but I have τ = γ τ0, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, I can compute L = (beta gamma c tau_0).

So let me compute each part.

Tau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta is 0.98875.

Gamma is 6.6667.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So compute beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5914.

Then, beta gamma c tau_0 = 6.5914 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute the numbers step by step.

First, 6.5914 * 3e8 = 1.9774e9.

Then, multiply by tau_0: 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that. 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 4.065 (since 2 * 2.05 is 4.1, and 0.9774*2.05 is about 2, so total around 4.1, but let me compute more accurately.

1.9774 * 2.056875: Let me compute 2 * 1.9774 = 3.9548. 0.056875 * 1.9774 ≈ 0.056875 * 2 = 0.11375, minus 0.056875 * 0.0226 ≈ 0.00128. So about 0.11375 - 0.00128 = 0.11247. So total is 3.9548 + 0.11247 = 4.06727. So approximately 4.0673e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait: 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15. So 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.0673e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close to 4.0673e-15. So probably option B is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can lead me astray.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

1. Gamma = EX / mX = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

2. Tau_0 = hbar / Gamma. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

3. Beta = (p c) / E. p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) = sqrt(64 - (1.2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 / 8 = 0.98875.

4. So beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 = let's compute it more accurately.

0.98875 *6.6667 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.

0.6667 * 0.98875 = 0.6667 * approx 0.98875.

Compute 0.6667 * 0.98875:

Well, 0.6667 * 1 = 0.6667.

Minus 0.6667 * 0.01125 (since 1 - 0.98875 = 0.01125).

0.6667 * 0.01125 ≈ 0.0075.

So 0.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.6667 - 0.0075 = 0.6592.

So total beta gamma is 5.9325 + 0.6592 ≈ 6.5917.

Then, c = 3e8 m/s.

So beta gamma c tau0: 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5917 *3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9775 * 2.056875: Let me calculate this precisely.

1.9775 * 2 = 3.955.

1.9775 * 0.056875 = ?

0.05 * 1.9775 = 0.098875.

0.006875 * 1.9775 = approx 0.01357.

So total is 0.098875 + 0.01357 = 0.112445.

So 3.955 + 0.112445 = 4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 meters. Rounding this gives approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option C is 5.0223e-15, which is about 25% larger. Hmm, but why am I getting 4.06e-15? The exact calculation might be leading to option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma?

Wait, another approach: beta gamma can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, so (pc)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4. So beta gamma = E/(m c²) * (p c)/E = (p c)/(m c^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, beta gamma = (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^(1/2) / m c^2.

Wait, let me think. E = gamma m c².

p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So beta gamma = (gamma beta) = (gamma m beta c) / (m c) ) = (p c) / (m c^2) ) * c? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, beta gamma = (p c) / (m c^2) * (E/(m c^2)) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe a better way is to compute beta gamma directly from E and m.

Wait, beta gamma can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )^{-1}.

Wait, another approach: beta gamma = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2).

So E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV.

E² =64 (GeV)^2, m² c^4= (1.2)^2=1.44 (GeV)^2.

E² - m² c^4 =64 -1.44=62.56.

So sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So beta gamma=7.91 /1.2 = approx 6.5917 GeV/(GeV) =6.5917.

So that's the same as before. So yes, beta gamma is about 6.5917.

So then, the calculation of L=beta gamma c tau0 is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Tau0 is the proper lifetime, so L should be beta gamma c tau0. Or is it beta c multiplied by tau, which is gamma tau0?

Yes, because L = v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime. v is beta c, t is gamma tau0. So L = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau0.

So the calculation is correct.

So L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me re-calculate 6.5917 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9 m/s.

Then, 1.9775e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

As before, 1.9775 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.0674.

So 4.0674e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but why is my calculation giving 4.0674e-15, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would get closer to 4.0655. Maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact product of 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, the product 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24:

Let me compute 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9775 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9775 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.056875 * 1.9775.

I can write this as (2 + 0.056875) * (1.9775).

= 2 * 1.9775 + 0.056875 * 1.9775.

= 3.955 + (0.056875 * 1.9775).

Compute 0.056875 * 1.9775:

0.05 *1.9775=0.098875.

0.006875 *1.9775=0.01357.

So total is 0.098875 +0.01357=0.112445.

So 3.955 +0.112445=4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. Close, but not exactly the same. Perhaps I made an error in the value of ħ. Let me check: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. I think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path length more directly.

The formula for the decay length is L = ( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) ) * c * hbar / ( Gamma * m c^2 )

Wait, let's see. Because tau0 is hbar / Gamma. So L = beta gamma c tau0.

Beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2). So L = [ (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) * c * hbar ] / [Gamma m c^2 ].

Simplify:

E is in GeV, m is GeV/c²? Wait, perhaps units need to be consistent.

Alternatively, let's express the formula as:

L = ( sqrt(E² - m²) / m ) * c * ( hbar / Gamma )

Wait, E and m are in GeV, so E² - m² is in (GeV)^2.

So sqrt(E² - m^2) is in GeV.

So, (sqrt(E² - m^2) ) / m = (GeV) / GeV = unitless, which is beta gamma as before.

So, L = beta gamma * c * ( hbar / Gamma )

Ah, because tau0 is hbar / Gamma.

So, L = beta gamma c ( hbar / Gamma )

So, substituting the numbers:

beta gamma = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2)/1.2 = sqrt(64 -1.44)/1.2 = sqrt(62.56)/1.2 =7.91 /1.2 ≈6.5917.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So,

L =6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV )

The GeV cancels, s cancels.

So:

6.5917 *3e8 *6.582e-25 /0.32.

Compute numerator first:6.5917 *3e8 =1.9775e9.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9775e9 *6.582e-25 =1.9775 *6.582 *1e-16.

1.9775 *6.582 ≈ let's compute:

1.9775 *6 =11.865.

1.9775 *0.582 = approx 1.9775 *0.5=0.98875, 1.9775 *0.082=0.161935. So total ≈1.150685.

So total 11.865 +1.150685=13.015685.

So 13.015685e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 13.015685e-16 /0.32 = 40.6739e-16 =4.06739e-15 m.

Which is about 4.0674e-15 m. So again, the same result.

But the options have option B as 4.0655e-15 m, which is just a bit less than my calculation, but very close.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of beta gamma. Let me compute sqrt(62.56):

62.56 is exactly 7.91 squared? Let me check:7.91 *7.91 =?

7 *7=49, 7*0.91=6.37, 0.91*7=6.37, 0.91*0.91≈0.8281.

Wait, that's not helpful. Let me compute 7.91^2:

7.91 *7.91:

= (8 - 0.09)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.09 + 0.09^2.

=64 - 1.44 + 0.0081 = 62.5681.

So sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91, but exactly it's 7.91 (since 7.91^2=62.5681, which is very close to 62.56). So beta gamma is 7.91 /1.2 =6.591666...

So maybe the precise calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar. Let me see: ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. If I use more decimals, say 6.582 x 10^-25.

Wait, let me compute the exact calculation again.

Compute L = (beta gamma c) * (hbar / Gamma )

beta gamma =6.591666...

hbar / Gamma =6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

beta gamma c * tau0 =6.591666... * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5916666667 *3e8=1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24= (1.9775 *2.056875) *1e-15.

1.9775 *2.056875=?

Let me compute 1.9775 * 2.056875 precisely.

1.9775 *2.056875:

Break it down into 1.9775 *2 =3.955.

1.9775 *0.056875=?

0.056875=  9/158. So 1.9775 * (9/158) approximately.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.9775 * 0.056875 as:

0.056875 = 56875e-7.

1.9775 *56875e-7 = let me compute 1.9775 *56875 = ?

Wait, perhaps that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 1.9775 *0.056875 is approximately 0.11244.

So 3.955 +0.11244=4.06744.

So again, 4.06744e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Let me compute 1.9775 * 2.056875:

Let me write it as (2 - 0.0225) * (2 + 0.056875)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, 1.9775 = 1 + 0.9775.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.9775 * 2.056875.

Let me do it step by step:

1.9775 * 2 =3.955.

1.9775 *0.056875:

= 1.9775 * (0.05 + 0.006875)

=1.9775 *0.05 =0.098875.

1.9775 *0.006875=0.01357.

So 0.098875 +0.01357=0.112445.

So total is 3.955 +0.112445=4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a little off. Maybe the exact calculation with precise values would give a slightly different number.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed of light, like 3e8 m/s, which is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it expects using a different value for ħ.

Wait, let me check the exact value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant is ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm. Wait, converting that into GeV·s.

1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 197.327 MeV fm = 0.197327 GeV * 1e-15 m.

But ħ in GeV·s is calculated as:

ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm * (1 GeV / 1e3 MeV) * (1e-15 m) * (1e3 fm / 1 m) )

Wait, no, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, 1 MeV fm = 1e6 eV * 1e-15 m = 1e-9 eV·m.

But perhaps I can use the conversion that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise value, like ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I think the initial assumption is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. The calculation leads me to 4.067e-15 m, but the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Perhaps I should choose option B as the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, beta gamma is E/(m c^2) * (pc)/(E) )= (pc)/(m c^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

Wait, no, another approach: beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2).

Which is (sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2)) /1.2 = sqrt(62.56)/1.2=7.91/1.2=6.591666...

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer should be approximately 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done using more precise intermediate steps, leading to 4.0655e-15. So I'll go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{E}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). First, compute \( E^2 - m^2 \):

\[
E^2 - m^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} = 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667 = 6.5917.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substitute \( \beta \gamma = 6.5917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, compute \( 6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9775 \times 10^9.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9775 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.9775 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 1.9775 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
1.9775 \cdot 2.056875 = 4.0674.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think this through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula that connects these is something like the mean distance L = v * τ * c, where v is the velocity, τ is the lifetime, and c is the speed of light. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I recall that the decay length can be calculated using the relation L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, because the lifetime observed is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma.

So the proper lifetime τ0 is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ0. So τ0 = ħ / Γ. But wait, let me check the units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ0 would be ħ divided by Γ. Let me convert ΓX to GeV. Oh right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime is τ = γ τ0, where γ is the Lorentz factor. To find γ, I need the particle's energy and mass.

The energy EX is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The Lorentz factor γ is E / (m c²) but since E is given in energy terms, I think E = γ m c². So γ = E / m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So γ is 6.6667, so τ = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.3711e-23 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is β c, and β = v/c. The velocity can be found using the relation between energy and momentum. Because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² = 64 (GeV)^2, (m c²)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

But wait, maybe I should calculate β using the relation β = (pc²)/(E). Because E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, so β = v/c = (p c)/(E).

So, with p c being 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so β = 7.91 / 8 = approximately 0.98875.

So β is about 0.98875. Therefore, v is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. Wait, no, because τ is the lifetime in the lab frame, so L = v * τ = β c * τ.

So putting it all together:

L = β c τ = β c γ τ0.

Wait, but I have τ = γ τ0, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, I can compute L = (beta gamma c tau_0).

So let me compute each part.

Tau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta is 0.98875.

Gamma is 6.6667.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So compute beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5914.

Then, beta gamma c tau_0 = 6.5914 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute the numbers step by step.

First, 6.5914 * 3e8 = 1.9774e9.

Then, multiply by tau_0: 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that. 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 4.065 (since 2 * 2.05 is 4.1, and 0.9774*2.05 is about 2, so total around 4.1, but let me compute more accurately.

1.9774 * 2.056875: Let me compute 2 * 1.9774 = 3.9548. 0.056875 * 1.9774 ≈ 0.056875 * 2 = 0.11375, minus 0.056875 * 0.0226 ≈ 0.00128. So about 0.11375 - 0.00128 = 0.11247. So total is 3.9548 + 0.11247 = 4.06727. So approximately 4.0673e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait: 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15. So 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.0673e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close to 4.0673e-15. So probably option B is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can lead me astray.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

1. Gamma = EX / mX = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

2. Tau_0 = hbar / Gamma. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

3. Beta = (p c) / E. p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) = sqrt(64 - (1.2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 / 8 = 0.98875.

4. So beta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 = let's compute it more accurately.

0.98875 *6.6667 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.

0.6667 * 0.98875 = 0.6667 * approx 0.98875.

Compute 0.6667 * 0.98875:

Well, 0.6667 * 1 = 0.6667.

Minus 0.6667 * 0.01125 (since 1 - 0.98875 = 0.01125).

0.6667 * 0.01125 ≈ 0.0075.

So 0.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.6667 - 0.0075 = 0.6592.

So total beta gamma is 5.9325 + 0.6592 ≈ 6.5917.

Then, c = 3e8 m/s.

So beta gamma c tau0: 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5917 *3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9775 * 2.056875: Let me calculate this precisely.

1.9775 * 2 = 3.955.

1.9775 * 0.056875 = ?

0.05 * 1.9775 = 0.098875.

0.006875 * 1.9775 = approx 0.01357.

So total is 0.098875 + 0.01357 = 0.112445.

So 3.955 + 0.112445 = 4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 meters. Rounding this gives approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option C is 5.0223e-15, which is about 25% larger. Hmm, but why am I getting 4.06e-15? The exact calculation might be leading to option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma?

Wait, another approach: beta gamma can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, so (pc)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4. So beta gamma = E/(m c²) * (p c)/E = (p c)/(m c^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, beta gamma = (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^(1/2) / m c^2.

Wait, let me think. E = gamma m c².

p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So beta gamma = (gamma beta) = (gamma m beta c) / (m c) ) = (p c) / (m c^2) ) * c? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, beta gamma = (p c) / (m c^2) * (E/(m c^2)) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe a better way is to compute beta gamma directly from E and m.

Wait, beta gamma can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )^{-1}.

Wait, another approach: beta gamma = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2).

So E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV.

E² =64 (GeV)^2, m² c^4= (1.2)^2=1.44 (GeV)^2.

E² - m² c^4 =64 -1.44=62.56.

So sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So beta gamma=7.91 /1.2 = approx 6.5917 GeV/(GeV) =6.5917.

So that's the same as before. So yes, beta gamma is about 6.5917.

So then, the calculation of L=beta gamma c tau0 is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Tau0 is the proper lifetime, so L should be beta gamma c tau0. Or is it beta c multiplied by tau, which is gamma tau0?

Yes, because L = v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime. v is beta c, t is gamma tau0. So L = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau0.

So the calculation is correct.

So L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me re-calculate 6.5917 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9 m/s.

Then, 1.9775e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

As before, 1.9775 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.0674.

So 4.0674e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but why is my calculation giving 4.0674e-15, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would get closer to 4.0655. Maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact product of 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, the product 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24:

Let me compute 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9775 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9775 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.056875 * 1.9775.

I can write this as (2 + 0.056875) * (1.9775).

= 2 * 1.9775 + 0.056875 * 1.9775.

= 3.955 + (0.056875 * 1.9775).

Compute 0.056875 * 1.9775:

0.05 *1.9775=0.098875.

0.006875 *1.9775=0.01357.

So total is 0.098875 +0.01357=0.112445.

So 3.955 +0.112445=4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. Close, but not exactly the same. Perhaps I made an error in the value of ħ. Let me check: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. I think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path length more directly.

The formula for the decay length is L = ( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) ) * c * hbar / ( Gamma * m c^2 )

Wait, let's see. Because tau0 is hbar / Gamma. So L = beta gamma c tau0.

Beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2). So L = [ (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) * c * hbar ] / [Gamma m c^2 ].

Simplify:

E is in GeV, m is GeV/c²? Wait, perhaps units need to be consistent.

Alternatively, let's express the formula as:

L = ( sqrt(E² - m²) / m ) * c * ( hbar / Gamma )

Wait, E and m are in GeV, so E² - m² is in (GeV)^2.

So sqrt(E² - m^2) is in GeV.

So, (sqrt(E² - m^2) ) / m = (GeV) / GeV = unitless, which is beta gamma as before.

So, L = beta gamma * c * ( hbar / Gamma )

Ah, because tau0 is hbar / Gamma.

So, L = beta gamma c ( hbar / Gamma )

So, substituting the numbers:

beta gamma = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2)/1.2 = sqrt(64 -1.44)/1.2 = sqrt(62.56)/1.2 =7.91 /1.2 ≈6.5917.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So,

L =6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV )

The GeV cancels, s cancels.

So:

6.5917 *3e8 *6.582e-25 /0.32.

Compute numerator first:6.5917 *3e8 =1.9775e9.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9775e9 *6.582e-25 =1.9775 *6.582 *1e-16.

1.9775 *6.582 ≈ let's compute:

1.9775 *6 =11.865.

1.9775 *0.582 = approx 1.9775 *0.5=0.98875, 1.9775 *0.082=0.161935. So total ≈1.150685.

So total 11.865 +1.150685=13.015685.

So 13.015685e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 13.015685e-16 /0.32 = 40.6739e-16 =4.06739e-15 m.

Which is about 4.0674e-15 m. So again, the same result.

But the options have option B as 4.0655e-15 m, which is just a bit less than my calculation, but very close.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of beta gamma. Let me compute sqrt(62.56):

62.56 is exactly 7.91 squared? Let me check:7.91 *7.91 =?

7 *7=49, 7*0.91=6.37, 0.91*7=6.37, 0.91*0.91≈0.8281.

Wait, that's not helpful. Let me compute 7.91^2:

7.91 *7.91:

= (8 - 0.09)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.09 + 0.09^2.

=64 - 1.44 + 0.0081 = 62.5681.

So sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91, but exactly it's 7.91 (since 7.91^2=62.5681, which is very close to 62.56). So beta gamma is 7.91 /1.2 =6.591666...

So maybe the precise calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar. Let me see: ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. If I use more decimals, say 6.582 x 10^-25.

Wait, let me compute the exact calculation again.

Compute L = (beta gamma c) * (hbar / Gamma )

beta gamma =6.591666...

hbar / Gamma =6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

beta gamma c * tau0 =6.591666... * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5916666667 *3e8=1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24= (1.9775 *2.056875) *1e-15.

1.9775 *2.056875=?

Let me compute 1.9775 * 2.056875 precisely.

1.9775 *2.056875:

Break it down into 1.9775 *2 =3.955.

1.9775 *0.056875=?

0.056875=  9/158. So 1.9775 * (9/158) approximately.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.9775 * 0.056875 as:

0.056875 = 56875e-7.

1.9775 *56875e-7 = let me compute 1.9775 *56875 = ?

Wait, perhaps that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 1.9775 *0.056875 is approximately 0.11244.

So 3.955 +0.11244=4.06744.

So again, 4.06744e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Let me compute 1.9775 * 2.056875:

Let me write it as (2 - 0.0225) * (2 + 0.056875)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, 1.9775 = 1 + 0.9775.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.9775 * 2.056875.

Let me do it step by step:

1.9775 * 2 =3.955.

1.9775 *0.056875:

= 1.9775 * (0.05 + 0.006875)

=1.9775 *0.05 =0.098875.

1.9775 *0.006875=0.01357.

So 0.098875 +0.01357=0.112445.

So total is 3.955 +0.112445=4.067445.

So 4.067445e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a little off. Maybe the exact calculation with precise values would give a slightly different number.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed of light, like 3e8 m/s, which is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it expects using a different value for ħ.

Wait, let me check the exact value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant is ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm. Wait, converting that into GeV·s.

1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 197.327 MeV fm = 0.197327 GeV * 1e-15 m.

But ħ in GeV·s is calculated as:

ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm * (1 GeV / 1e3 MeV) * (1e-15 m) * (1e3 fm / 1 m) )

Wait, no, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, 1 MeV fm = 1e6 eV * 1e-15 m = 1e-9 eV·m.

But perhaps I can use the conversion that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise value, like ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I think the initial assumption is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. The calculation leads me to 4.067e-15 m, but the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Perhaps I should choose option B as the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, beta gamma is E/(m c^2) * (pc)/(E) )= (pc)/(m c^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

Wait, no, another approach: beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2).

Which is (sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2)) /1.2 = sqrt(62.56)/1.2=7.91/1.2=6.591666...

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer should be approximately 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done using more precise intermediate steps, leading to 4.0655e-15. So I'll go with option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{E}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). First, compute \( E^2 - m^2 \):

\[
E^2 - m^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} = 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667 = 6.5917.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substitute \( \beta \gamma = 6.5917 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, compute \( 6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9775 \times 10^9.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9775 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.9775 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 1.9775 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
