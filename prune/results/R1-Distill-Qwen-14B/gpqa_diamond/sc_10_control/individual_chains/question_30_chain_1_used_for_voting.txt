Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from chemistry class. Oh right, when something emits light, it's because the electrons are moving between energy levels, right?

So the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Conjugated pi systems usually mean the molecule has alternating double bonds, like in something big, maybe like a long chain. These conjugated systems are important for absorbing certain wavelengths of light because they can have different energy gaps.

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

But wait, when a compound emits light, it's usually after absorbing some. Oh, but wait, no, the question says the dye emits light. So I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, when a substance absorbs light, it's because electrons get excited. Then when they drop back, they emit light. So the emitted light's energy corresponds to the energy gap between the states.

But the question here is about what color is absorbed, not emitted. Wait, the question says, "what color of light is absorbed", so the emitted light is a result of the absorption. Hmm. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy gap between the excited state and the ground state. Or wait, no: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one, then emits a photon when it returns. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait no, actually, the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states. So if the energy is 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon. That would mean the absorbed photon has the same energy because it's the same transition.

Wait, but sometimes molecules emit a lower energy photon if there's a cascade, but I think in this case, it's a conjugated system, so maybe a single emission.

So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. I need to find the wavelength corresponding to this energy to determine the color.

Let me calculate the wavelength. The formula is E = hc / λ. Rearranged, λ = hc / E.

I remember that h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But since energy is given in eV, maybe I should use a conversion factor. Oh right, 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules.

So E is 2.3393 eV, so in joules that's 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 multiplied by 1.602 is about, let me see: 2 *1.6 is 3.2, 0.3393 *1.6 is about 0.543. So total around 3.743e-19 J.

Wait, but more accurately, 2.3393 * 1.602 is:

2 *1.602=3.204
0.3393 *1.602 = Let's compute that: 0.3*1.602=0.4806, 0.0393*1.602≈0.0630. So total 0.5436. So 3.204 + 0.5436 = 3.7476e-19 J.

So E = 3.7476e-19 J. Now, hc is 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (3.7476e-19 J) ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1.9878e-25 by 3.7476e-19: Let's compute 1.9878 / 3.7476 ≈ approximately 0.5305. Then the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6. So 0.5305 *1e-6 meters, which is 530.5 nanometers.

Hmm, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. Wait, but wait, the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. So if the dye emits green, that means it absorbed a photon of green? Or wait, no.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The process is: the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited to a higher energy state, and then emits a photon when it returns to the ground state. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon if it's a single transition. So if the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), then the absorbed photon must have been at the same energy.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the molecule absorbs green, it would emit green, but the color we see would be the complementary color. Wait, no, that's when it's about color transmission, but in this case, the question is about what color is absorbed.

Wait, no, the question is about what color is absorbed by the compound. So if the compound emits green when excited, that suggests that the energy gap is such that the emitted light is green. But the absorbed light is at the same energy. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is green as well. But that would mean the compound absorbs green and emits green. But that doesn't make sense, because when something emits light, it's usually because it's losing that energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same. So the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted.

Wait, but the wavelengths would be the same. So if the compound emits at 530 nm (green), then it absorbed a photon of 530 nm (green). So the compound would absorb green light.

But wait, when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it doesn't transmit or reflect them, so the color we see is the complement. For example, if something absorbs red, it would appear cyan because red is absorbed, and the other colors are reflected.

But the question is specifically about what color is absorbed, not the color that's emitted or the color we see. So the absorbed light is green, so the correct answer would be green. But looking at the options, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow. Oh wait, none of these are green. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the wavelength. Let me check the calculation again.

E = 2.3393 eV. Let me compute the wavelength accurately.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E in J is 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = let me compute this accurately.

2.3393 * 1.602 = ?

Compute 2 *1.602 = 3.204
0.3393 *1.602: 0.3 *1.602=0.4806, 0.0393 *1.602= approximately 0.063.

So 0.4806 + 0.063 = 0.5436.

So total E = 3.204 + 0.5436 = 3.7476e-19 J.

So λ = (1.9878e-25) / (3.7476e-19) = (1.9878 /3.7476) * 1e-6 meters.

1.9878 /3.7476 ≈ approx 0.5305.

So 0.5305e-6 meters is 530.5 nm.

Wait, 530 nm is green. So if the emitted light is green, the dye absorbed green. So why are the options not including green? The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? The dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV.

Wait, perhaps I got the process wrong. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher state (excited). Then, when it returns, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon. So the energy corresponds to the transition. So the color absorbed is the same as the color emitted.

But the options don't have green. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the emitted light is the complementary color?

Wait, no. The color we see is the color that is transmitted or reflected. If a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't reflect it, so the color we see is the complement of the absorbed color.

But the question is about the absorbed color, not the color we see. So in this case, if the compound emits green, it absorbed green, but that's not among the options. So perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the energy. No, the energy is given as emitted. So the energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength again.

Wait, let me check the conversion from eV to wavelength. There's a standard formula: wavelength (in nm) = 1240 / energy (in eV). Because 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in eV·nm.

So 1240 divided by 2.3393 is approximately 530 nm. So that's correct.

So 530 nm is green. But none of the options are green. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the complementary color?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. If the compound emits green, then the absorbed light is green. So the compound must absorb green, but if the options don't have green, perhaps the question is about the color that is not absorbed, i.e., the color we see.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the absorbed color. So maybe I'm wrong in the calculation. Let me check. Maybe the energy is the energy of the absorbed photon, not the emitted?

Wait, no, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so that's the emitted photon's energy. So the absorbed photon must have the same energy. So the compound absorbs green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1240 / 2.3393.

2.3393 * 530 = ?

2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65, 2.3393 *30=70.179, total 1239.8. Oh, so 2.3393 *530 is approx 1240. So 1240 / 2.3393 is 530 nm. So yes, correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color that's NOT emitted. Because if the dye emits green, then the color we see is the complement, which is magenta. But that's not any of the options either.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the emitted light is the complementary color of what's absorbed. So if the compound absorbs green, it emits the complement, which is magenta, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the absorbed photon, which is green, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I have to think in terms of which color is in the visible spectrum that corresponds to 530 nm.

The options are A) Red, which is about 650 nm; B) Violet, around 400 nm; C) Blue, around 450; D) Yellow, around 570. Oh wait, 530 is between blue and green. So closest would be blue (450), but 530 is more towards green.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color that's absorbed, which is green, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy emitted is higher than the absorbed. Wait, no, in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, that's right! I think I messed up earlier. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state, and when it emits, it can emit a photon of lower energy. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed.

Wait, but the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

Hmm, that's a critical point. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the calculation I did earlier gives the wavelength of the emitted photon. The absorbed photon is at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, so what's the wavelength of the absorbed photon?

If the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), the absorbed photon is at a shorter wavelength, higher energy.

So, for example, if the molecule absorbs blue (450 nm) and emits green (530 nm), that would fit.

Because the energy of blue is higher than green. So the compound absorbs blue and emits green.

So in that case, the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

Wait, so let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon's energy is higher, so its wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range.

So the absorbed color is blue or violet. Let me see what the options are.

Options are A) Red (long wavelength, lower energy), B) Violet (short, high energy), C) Blue (moderately short), D) Yellow (longer, lower energy).

If the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted, then it's a shorter wavelength. Let me think, if the emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed could be blue (450 nm), which is 2.75 eV.

Wait, let me compute the energy for blue light. Blue is around 450 nm.

Energy E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

So if the absorbed energy is 2.75 eV, then the emitted would be 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed color is blue, which is option C.

So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, another thought: the absorbed light's energy is higher, so its wavelength is shorter. So if the emitted is 530 nm, the absorbed could be in the blue or violet.

But which one? The conjugated system's energy gap would determine the absorbed wavelength. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, meaning longer wavelengths are absorbed.

Wait, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy required to excite the electron, so longer wavelengths (lower energy) are absorbed. So if the compound is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength) than in a less conjugated system.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is at 2.34 eV, which is green. The absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted, so perhaps it's in the blue or violet.

In an extensively conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon's energy is lower. Wait, but if the energy gap is smaller, the photon emitted has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon would be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted's.

So, for example, if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed could be blue (450 nm, higher energy) or violet (400 nm, even higher energy).

But how do I know which one?

Well, the question asks what color is absorbed. The options are violet, blue, etc.

I think I need to calculate the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait, but I don't have the energy of the absorbed photon. I only know the emitted's. So perhaps I can't calculate the exact wavelength. Hmm.

Wait, but if the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon's energy must be higher. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range. So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Which one is more likely?

Well, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap. So the energy difference between the ground and excited states is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted's.

Wait, but in a conjugated system, the energy gap corresponds to the wavelength absorbed. So if the system is very conjugated, the absorbed photon is at a longer wavelength (lower energy), but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The energy gap (ΔE) between the ground state and excited state is what determines the wavelength of the absorbed photon. A larger ΔE means higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons are absorbed.

Conjugated systems have lower energy gaps because the electrons are delocalized over more atoms, so the energy required for the transition is less. So, lower energy (longer wavelength) photons are absorbed.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green). The absorbed photon is higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted. So, if the conjugated system is extensive, the ΔE is smaller, so the absorbed photon's energy is only slightly higher than the emitted.

So what's the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons? Let's say the absorbed energy is E_abs, and the emitted is E_emit =2.3393 eV.

So E_abs = E_emit + energy released during the emission.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it excites to a higher energy state, and when it emits a photon, it drops to a lower energy state than the excited state. So the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the state it drops to.

But in fluorescence, the molecule usually drops from the excited state to a lower state, not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So, the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than the emitted's.

So, if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed is in the blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are violet, blue, etc.

So, the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. Let's calculate what is the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy difference, I can't be sure. But perhaps in such conjugated systems, the absorbed light is in the visible range near the emitted.

But given the options, which one is shorter than 530 nm? Violet is about 400, blue about 450, which is shorter than 530.

So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet region.

But which one is correct? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can think about typical dyes. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the green/yellow, which is fluorescence.

Wait, let's think about the color wheel. The complementary colors: if a dye absorbs blue, it emits the complementary color, which is orange. But that doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, if the emitted light is green (530), the absorbed photon is higher energy, so blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

In many fluorescent materials, the absorbed photon is higher energy (blue or UV) and emits lower energy (yellow or green).

So in this case, if the emitted is green, the absorbed is probably blue.

But wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength again, which is 530 nm.

So, the compound emits green. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, so its wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

The options are B and C.

In the visible spectrum, blue is about 450 nm (2.75 eV), violet about 400 nm (3.1 eV).

So which is more likely? Well, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap, meaning the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon's energy is, say, 2.7 eV (blue). So the absorbed color is blue.

Thus, the correct answer would be C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)), \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)), and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), the energy in joules is:

\[
E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.7476 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

The wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{3.7476 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This corresponds to green light. However, the question asks for the color of light absorbed, not emitted. In fluorescence, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted photon, meaning the absorbed photon has a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The absorbed photon's energy is slightly higher than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Among the options provided:

- **Red (650 nm)**: Too long a wavelength and lower energy than the emitted light.
- **Violet (400 nm)**: A very short wavelength with high energy, but less likely for an extensively conjugated system.
- **Blue (450 nm)**: A reasonable shorter wavelength with higher energy than green, consistent with fluorescence.
- **Yellow (570 nm)**: Longer than green and lower energy, not matching the absorbed photon.

Extensively conjugated systems typically have smaller energy gaps, meaning the absorbed photon's energy is only slightly higher than the emitted photon. This makes blue light (\(\sim 450 \, \text{nm}\)) a more likely candidate for absorption than violet light. Thus, the compound absorbs blue light and emits green light.

**Answer: C**

So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. I need to find the wavelength corresponding to this energy to determine the color.

Let me calculate the wavelength. The formula is E = hc / λ. Rearranged, λ = hc / E.

2 *1.602=3.204
0.3393 *1.602 = Let's compute that: 0.3*1.602=0.4806, 0.0393*1.602≈0.0630. So total 0.5436. So 3.204 + 0.5436 = 3.7476e-19 J.

So E = 3.7476e-19 J. Now, hc is 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (3.7476e-19 J) ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1.9878e-25 by 3.7476e-19: Let's compute 1.9878 / 3.7476 ≈ approximately 0.5305. Then the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6. So 0.5305 *1e-6 meters, which is 530.5 nanometers.

Hmm, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. Wait, but wait, the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. So if the dye emits green, that means it absorbed a photon of green? Or wait, no.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the wavelength. Let me check the calculation again.

E = 2.3393 eV. Let me compute the wavelength accurately.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E in J is 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = let me compute this accurately.

2.3393 * 1.602 = ?

Compute 2 *1.602 = 3.204
0.3393 *1.602: 0.3 *1.602=0.4806, 0.0393 *1.602= approximately 0.063.

So 0.4806 + 0.063 = 0.5436.

So total E = 3.204 + 0.5436 = 3.7476e-19 J.

So λ = (1.9878e-25) / (3.7476e-19) = (1.9878 /3.7476) * 1e-6 meters.

1.9878 /3.7476 ≈ approx 0.5305.

So 0.5305e-6 meters is 530.5 nm.

Wait, 530 nm is green. So if the emitted light is green, the dye absorbed green. So why are the options not including green? The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? The dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV.

Wait, perhaps I got the process wrong. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher state (excited). Then, when it returns, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon. So the energy corresponds to the transition. So the color absorbed is the same as the color emitted.

But the options don't have green. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the emitted light is the complementary color?

Wait, no. The color we see is the color that is transmitted or reflected. If a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't reflect it, so the color we see is the complement of the absorbed color.

But the question is about the absorbed color, not the color we see. So in this case, if the compound emits green, it absorbed green, but that's not among the options. So perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the energy. No, the energy is given as emitted. So the energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength again.

Wait, let me check the conversion from eV to wavelength. There's a standard formula: wavelength (in nm) = 1240 / energy (in eV). Because 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in eV·nm.

So 1240 divided by 2.3393 is approximately 530 nm. So that's correct.

So 530 nm is green. But none of the options are green. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the complementary color?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. If the compound emits green, then the absorbed light is green. So the compound must absorb green, but if the options don't have green, perhaps the question is about the color that is not absorbed, i.e., the color we see.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the absorbed color. So maybe I'm wrong in the calculation. Let me check. Maybe the energy is the energy of the absorbed photon, not the emitted?

Wait, no, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so that's the emitted photon's energy. So the absorbed photon must have the same energy. So the compound absorbs green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1240 / 2.3393.

2.3393 * 530 = ?

2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65, 2.3393 *30=70.179, total 1239.8. Oh, so 2.3393 *530 is approx 1240. So 1240 / 2.3393 is 530 nm. So yes, correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color that's NOT emitted. Because if the dye emits green, then the color we see is the complement, which is magenta. But that's not any of the options either.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the emitted light is the complementary color of what's absorbed. So if the compound absorbs green, it emits the complement, which is magenta, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the absorbed photon, which is green, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I have to think in terms of which color is in the visible spectrum that corresponds to 530 nm.

The options are A) Red, which is about 650 nm; B) Violet, around 400 nm; C) Blue, around 450; D) Yellow, around 570. Oh wait, 530 is between blue and green. So closest would be blue (450), but 530 is more towards green.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color that's absorbed, which is green, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy emitted is higher than the absorbed. Wait, no, in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, that's right! I think I messed up earlier. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state, and when it emits, it can emit a photon of lower energy. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed.

Wait, but the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

Hmm, that's a critical point. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the calculation I did earlier gives the wavelength of the emitted photon. The absorbed photon is at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, so what's the wavelength of the absorbed photon?

If the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), the absorbed photon is at a shorter wavelength, higher energy.

So, for example, if the molecule absorbs blue (450 nm) and emits green (530 nm), that would fit.

Because the energy of blue is higher than green. So the compound absorbs blue and emits green.

So in that case, the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

Wait, so let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon's energy is higher, so its wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range.

So the absorbed color is blue or violet. Let me see what the options are.

Options are A) Red (long wavelength, lower energy), B) Violet (short, high energy), C) Blue (moderately short), D) Yellow (longer, lower energy).

If the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted, then it's a shorter wavelength. Let me think, if the emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed could be blue (450 nm), which is 2.75 eV.

Wait, let me compute the energy for blue light. Blue is around 450 nm.

Energy E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

So if the absorbed energy is 2.75 eV, then the emitted would be 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed color is blue, which is option C.

So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, another thought: the absorbed light's energy is higher, so its wavelength is shorter. So if the emitted is 530 nm, the absorbed could be in the blue or violet.

But which one? The conjugated system's energy gap would determine the absorbed wavelength. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, meaning longer wavelengths are absorbed.

Wait, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy required to excite the electron, so longer wavelengths (lower energy) are absorbed. So if the compound is extensively conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is of lower energy (longer wavelength) than in a less conjugated system.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is at 2.34 eV, which is green. The absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted, so perhaps it's in the blue or violet.

In an extensively conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon's energy is lower. Wait, but if the energy gap is smaller, the photon emitted has lower energy than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon would be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted's.

So, for example, if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed could be blue (450 nm, higher energy) or violet (400 nm, even higher energy).

But how do I know which one?

Well, the question asks what color is absorbed. The options are violet, blue, etc.

I think I need to calculate the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait, but I don't have the energy of the absorbed photon. I only know the emitted's. So perhaps I can't calculate the exact wavelength. Hmm.

Wait, but if the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon's energy must be higher. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range. So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Which one is more likely?

Well, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap. So the energy difference between the ground and excited states is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted's.

Wait, but in a conjugated system, the energy gap corresponds to the wavelength absorbed. So if the system is very conjugated, the absorbed photon is at a longer wavelength (lower energy), but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The energy gap (ΔE) between the ground state and excited state is what determines the wavelength of the absorbed photon. A larger ΔE means higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons are absorbed.

Conjugated systems have lower energy gaps because the electrons are delocalized over more atoms, so the energy required for the transition is less. So, lower energy (longer wavelength) photons are absorbed.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green). The absorbed photon is higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted. So, if the conjugated system is extensive, the ΔE is smaller, so the absorbed photon's energy is only slightly higher than the emitted.

So what's the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons? Let's say the absorbed energy is E_abs, and the emitted is E_emit =2.3393 eV.

So E_abs = E_emit + energy released during the emission.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it excites to a higher energy state, and when it emits a photon, it drops to a lower energy state than the excited state. So the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the state it drops to.

But in fluorescence, the molecule usually drops from the excited state to a lower state, not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So, the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than the emitted's.

So, if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed is in the blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are violet, blue, etc.

So, the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. Let's calculate what is the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy difference, I can't be sure. But perhaps in such conjugated systems, the absorbed light is in the visible range near the emitted.

But given the options, which one is shorter than 530 nm? Violet is about 400, blue about 450, which is shorter than 530.

So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet region.

But which one is correct? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can think about typical dyes. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the green/yellow, which is fluorescence.

Wait, let's think about the color wheel. The complementary colors: if a dye absorbs blue, it emits the complementary color, which is orange. But that doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, if the emitted light is green (530), the absorbed photon is higher energy, so blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

In many fluorescent materials, the absorbed photon is higher energy (blue or UV) and emits lower energy (yellow or green).

So in this case, if the emitted is green, the absorbed is probably blue.

But wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength again, which is 530 nm.

So, the compound emits green. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, so its wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed color is blue or violet.

The options are B and C.

In the visible spectrum, blue is about 450 nm (2.75 eV), violet about 400 nm (3.1 eV).

So which is more likely? Well, the more conjugated the system, the lower the energy gap, meaning the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon's energy is, say, 2.7 eV (blue). So the absorbed color is blue.

Thus, the correct answer would be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)), \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)), and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), the energy in joules is:

\[
E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.7476 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

The wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{3.7476 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This corresponds to green light. However, the question asks for the color of light absorbed, not emitted. In fluorescence, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted photon, meaning the absorbed photon has a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The absorbed photon's energy is slightly higher than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Among the options provided:

- **Red (650 nm)**: Too long a wavelength and lower energy than the emitted light.
- **Violet (400 nm)**: A very short wavelength with high energy, but less likely for an extensively conjugated system.
- **Blue (450 nm)**: A reasonable shorter wavelength with higher energy than green, consistent with fluorescence.
- **Yellow (570 nm)**: Longer than green and lower energy, not matching the absorbed photon.

Extensively conjugated systems typically have smaller energy gaps, meaning the absorbed photon's energy is only slightly higher than the emitted photon. This makes blue light (\(\sim 450 \, \text{nm}\)) a more likely candidate for absorption than violet light. Thus, the compound absorbs blue light and emits green light.
