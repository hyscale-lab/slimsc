Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. I should probably normalize this vector first. But wait, the problem says the state is given by that matrix, so maybe I need to check if it's normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the elements.

So, the state vector is a column vector with components -1, 2, 1. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So, the actual state vector should be this divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. Otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to 1.

Wait, but maybe the given state is already normalized? Let me double-check. 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 1 squared is 1. Sum is 6, so sqrt(6) is the magnitude. So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me look at the structure of P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. 

I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I should find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them. Or wait, another approach is that the expectation value of P is the average outcome, but the question isn't about expectation; it's about the probability of getting 0.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state. If 0 isn't an eigenvalue, then the probability is zero.

So let me find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I)=0.

Wait, but looking at the matrix P, maybe it's easier to see if it's Hermitian because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements of P are real, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let's look at the transpose of P.

The transpose of P would have first column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second column (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing to the original P matrix, which is the same as the transpose. So P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good because it's an observable.

Now, to find eigenvalues. Hmm, 3x3 matrix, so maybe I can find its trace and determinant to find the eigenvalues.

Wait, the trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. The diagonal elements are 0 (from first row), 0 (second row), and 0 (third row). So trace is 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P? Let me compute it. For a 3x3 matrix, I can use the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note the structure.

Looking at P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, perhaps this matrix has some symmetry that can be exploited. Alternatively, maybe it's a circulant matrix or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator? Because if P squared equals P, then it's a projection. Let me check.

Compute P squared. Let me compute the (1,1) element of P squared. That would be row 1 of P multiplied by column 1 of P. So, (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) = 0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2. Hmm, so (1,1) element is 1/2. But in P, (1,1) is 0. So P squared is not equal to P. So it's not a projection operator. So that approach doesn't help.

So back to eigenvalues. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λ I is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

So the determinant is the determinant of this matrix.

Calculating determinant:

| -λ      1/√2       0     |

| 1/√2    -λ      1/√2   |

| 0       1/√2    -λ     |

I can compute the determinant using the first row for expansion.

So,

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
      - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) 
      + 0 * ... (so that term is zero).

Compute each minor:

First minor for -λ:

The minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]

[1/√2, -λ ]

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor for 1/√2:

The minor is the determinant of:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0,    -λ  ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ / sqrt(2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) [ λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ -λ / sqrt(2) ]

Simplify:

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) )

The second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) ) = λ (1/2).

So,

det = -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Wait, because -λ (λ² - 1/2) is -λ³ + (λ/2).

Then the second term: [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) ] is negative, but in the expansion, it's subtracting that, so overall, it's + (lambda/2).

So,

det = (-λ³ + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) )

= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor that:

λ (-λ² + 1) =0 → λ (1 - λ²) =0

So solutions are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0.

In quantum mechanics, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, then compute the projection of the state onto this eigenvector, then square the absolute value.

So first, find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v =0 → P v=0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) (v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So we can write this as v1*(1, 0, -1).

We can choose v1 =1 (any non-zero scalar multiple), so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T.

But wait, since the eigenvectors can be any scalar multiple, I can choose the vector as (1, 0, -1).

Now, I need to normalize this eigenvector. Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 =2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) )^T.

Now, the system's state is |ψ> = [ -1/(sqrt(6)), 2/(sqrt(6)), 1/(sqrt(6)) ]^T.

Wait, earlier I thought the state was given as (-1,2,1), but realized it's not normalized. So the actual state is (each component divided by sqrt(6)).

So, the state is normalized as:

ψ = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T.

Now, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is u = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

The probability of getting 0 is |<u|ψ>|^2.

Compute the inner product:

< u | ψ > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

So,

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)=sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).

So,

= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the outcome \( 0 \). The system's state is given as a column vector \( \psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( 0 \), we determine the eigenvalues of \( P \). The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( P - \lambda I \), the determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring, we find the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

Thus, the possible outcomes of measuring \( P \) are \( 0, 1, -1 \). We are interested in the probability of obtaining \( 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is found by solving \( P v = 0 \). From the equations, we find the eigenvector:

\[
v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( \psi \) onto \( u \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle u | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle u | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I should find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them. Or wait, another approach is that the expectation value of P is the average outcome, but the question isn't about expectation; it's about the probability of getting 0.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state. If 0 isn't an eigenvalue, then the probability is zero.

So let me find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I)=0.

Wait, but looking at the matrix P, maybe it's easier to see if it's Hermitian because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements of P are real, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let's look at the transpose of P.

Wait, the trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. The diagonal elements are 0 (from first row), 0 (second row), and 0 (third row). So trace is 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P? Let me compute it. For a 3x3 matrix, I can use the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note the structure.

Looking at P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, perhaps this matrix has some symmetry that can be exploited. Alternatively, maybe it's a circulant matrix or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator? Because if P squared equals P, then it's a projection. Let me check.

Compute P squared. Let me compute the (1,1) element of P squared. That would be row 1 of P multiplied by column 1 of P. So, (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) = 0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2. Hmm, so (1,1) element is 1/2. But in P, (1,1) is 0. So P squared is not equal to P. So it's not a projection operator. So that approach doesn't help.

So back to eigenvalues. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λ I is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

So the determinant is the determinant of this matrix.

Calculating determinant:

| -λ      1/√2       0     |

| 1/√2    -λ      1/√2   |

| 0       1/√2    -λ     |

I can compute the determinant using the first row for expansion.

So,

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
      - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) 
      + 0 * ... (so that term is zero).

Compute each minor:

First minor for -λ:

The minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ , 1/√2 ]

[1/√2, -λ ]

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor for 1/√2:

The minor is the determinant of:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0,    -λ  ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ / sqrt(2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) [ λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ -λ / sqrt(2) ]

Simplify:

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) )

The second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) ) = λ (1/2).

So,

det = -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Wait, because -λ (λ² - 1/2) is -λ³ + (λ/2).

Then the second term: [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) ] is negative, but in the expansion, it's subtracting that, so overall, it's + (lambda/2).

So,

det = (-λ³ + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) )

= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor that:

λ (-λ² + 1) =0 → λ (1 - λ²) =0

So solutions are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0.

In quantum mechanics, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, then compute the projection of the state onto this eigenvector, then square the absolute value.

So first, find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v =0 → P v=0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) (v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So we can write this as v1*(1, 0, -1).

We can choose v1 =1 (any non-zero scalar multiple), so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T.

But wait, since the eigenvectors can be any scalar multiple, I can choose the vector as (1, 0, -1).

Now, I need to normalize this eigenvector. Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 =2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) )^T.

Now, the system's state is |ψ> = [ -1/(sqrt(6)), 2/(sqrt(6)), 1/(sqrt(6)) ]^T.

Wait, earlier I thought the state was given as (-1,2,1), but realized it's not normalized. So the actual state is (each component divided by sqrt(6)).

So, the state is normalized as:

ψ = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T.

Now, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is u = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

The probability of getting 0 is |<u|ψ>|^2.

Compute the inner product:

< u | ψ > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

So,

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)=sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).

So,

= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.


To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the outcome \( 0 \). The system's state is given as a column vector \( \psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( 0 \), we determine the eigenvalues of \( P \). The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( P - \lambda I \), the determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring, we find the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

Thus, the possible outcomes of measuring \( P \) are \( 0, 1, -1 \). We are interested in the probability of obtaining \( 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is found by solving \( P v = 0 \). From the equations, we find the eigenvector:

\[
v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( \psi \) onto \( u \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle u | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle u | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
