Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what’s going on.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Then, it’s treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine to form product 1. Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temp, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temp to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl to give product 4. The question is about the structure of product 4, with four options provided.

Alright, so I need to break down each reaction step and see how the structure changes each time.

First, the starting compound is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. That's a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4 and a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The configuration is S at the 4 position, which I should note.

Step 1: Treating with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine. TBS-Cl is a silylating agent, commonly used to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine is a base, so it probably deprotonates the hydroxyl group to make it a better nucleophile for the silylation. So, the hydroxyl group on C4 would be replaced by a TBS group. So product 1 would be the TBS protected derivative of 4-hydroxy. So the structure now is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is typically used in conjugate additions. Conjugate addition (like a 1,4-addition) would happen to the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) system. The enone here is the cyclohexenone. The Gilman reagent adds a benzyl group, I think, because after the addition of the Gilman reagent, they often add an electrophile.

Wait, wait, Ph2CuLi is a cuprate reagent. It does a conjugate addition. So in the enone, the cuprate would add to the beta position (C3), and the lithium would pick up a proton from somewhere, maybe the alpha position (C2). But wait, cyclohexenone is a 2-enone, so the enone is between C1 (the ketone) and C2-C3 double bond.

So the mechanism would involve the cuprate attacking the beta carbon (C3), and then the leaving group (like the alpha proton) would be abstracted, forming a new bond. But wait, the cuprate is a strong base as well. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the conjugate addition without deprotonation.

Wait, no, the typical 1,4 addition with cuprates would add the R group (like the aryl or benzyl group) to the beta carbon, and the conjugate base would form a new carbon-carbon bond. So in this case, the cuprate (Ph2CuLi) would add to the beta position (C3) of the enone.

But wait, the starting product after silylation is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So when the cuprate adds, it would target the beta position (C3). So the cuprate (which has a benzyl group, from the Ph2CuLi?) Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is a diphenyl cuprate. So the R group added would be a phenyl?

Wait, no. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is a cuprate where the R is phenyl. But the next step is adding benzyl bromide. Oh, right, so maybe the cuprate does a conjugate addition to the enone, and then the benzyl bromide would alkylate at the alpha position.

Wait, perhaps the procedure is a two-step process. First, the cuprate adds to the enone, then the benzyl bromide is added as an electrophile.

Wait, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds to the enone, and then the benzyl bromide acts as an electrophile in an alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The cuprate adds in a conjugate fashion to the enone, and the benzyl bromide is perhaps an electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group. But wait, the second step is benzyl bromide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is a conjugate addition followed by alkylation. Let me think: The cuprate (Ph2CuLi) adds a benzyl group via conjugate addition, but wait, no, the cuprate is diphenyl, so it's adding a phenyl group. But then after that, benzyl bromide would be an alkylating agent, perhaps adding another group.

Wait, maybe the first step is a 1,4-addition of the cuprate to the enone, forming a new bond between the cuprate's R (Ph) and the beta carbon (C3). Then, the benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group somewhere else.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps after the cuprate adds, the benzyl bromide is used for an alkylation. Let me think: when the cuprate adds to the enone, it forms an alkoxide intermediate. Then, perhaps this is quenched with benzyl bromide, leading to alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the overall process. The starting compound is a cyclohexenone with a TBS group on C4.

In the presence of a strong base like Ph2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile, the enolate might form, but I think the cuprate does a conjugate addition. The cuprate would add to the beta position (C3), and then the benzyl bromide would perhaps alkylate the alpha position (C2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds the benzyl group to the beta carbon, but wait, the cuprate is diphenyl, not benzyl. So maybe the cuprate adds a phenyl group, and then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the first step is adding the phenyl group via the cuprate, and then the benzyl is added via the benzyl bromide. But where?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is diphenyl, so the R group is phenyl, not benzyl. So, perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to another position.

Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds to the enone, and the benzyl bromide is used in a Stille coupling or something else. No, I think it's more likely an alkylation.

Wait, perhaps after the cuprate adds, the resulting compound has a new phenyl group on C3, and then benzyl bromide would alkylate, perhaps the alpha position (C2) via an SN2 mechanism.

But wait, cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone. The positions are numbered such that the ketone is at C1, double bond between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl (now protected as TBS) at C4.

So, the starting structure (product 1) is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

When treated with Ph2CuLi (a strong base and nucleophile), it would likely perform a conjugate addition. The cuprate adds to the beta carbon (C3), and the alpha proton (from C2) is abstracted as a base, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but if the cuprate is diphenyl, it would add a phenyl group to C3. So the structure would have a phenyl group attached to C3.

But wait, the product after this step (product 2) would have this phenyl group. Then, after adding benzyl bromide, perhaps another alkylation occurs.

Wait, but benzyl bromide is a good electrophile. Maybe after the cuprate adds, the benzyl bromide is used to perform an alkylation at another position, perhaps the alpha position (C2) or the gamma position (C5 or C6).

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide adds via an enolate.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: first, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to the alpha position (C2) via an enolate.

But in any case, after these steps, product 2 would have a phenyl group at C3 and a benzyl group at C2.

Wait, but let me think about the mechanism. The cuprate (Ph2CuLi) would attack the beta carbon (C3) of the enone, opening the double bond. The Li would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (C2), leading to a conjugate addition. So the product would have a new bond between the phenyl group (from the cuprate) and C3.

Wait, no. The cuprate adds the R group (Ph) to the beta carbon, and the alpha carbon (C2) becomes deprotonated. But then, what happens with the benzyl bromide?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent that adds to the enolate. So after the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, the molecule would have a new structure. Then, the next step would form an enolate, which would attack benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added after the cuprate. So first, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, making product 2a. Then, perhaps the enolate is formed, which attacks benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group to C2.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyl bromide is added without the enolate, but maybe as an SN2 reaction on a good leaving group. But wait, in this molecule, the only leaving group is the TBS group on C4. But that's a silyl ether, which isn't a good leaving group unless acid is present.

Hmm, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added in an alkylation after the cuprate addition. So perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, making that a new substituent. Then the benzyl bromide is added as an electrophilic benzyl group to another position.

Wait, maybe the benzyl group adds to the alpha position (C2). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added via a different mechanism. Another possibility is that, after the cuprate addition, the molecule undergoes some ring-opening or rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall transformations. The first step is silylation, so the OH becomes TBS. Then, in step 2, a conjugate addition occurs, adding a phenyl group. Then, benzyl bromide comes in. Oh! Wait, perhaps the step after the cuprate addition is a Michael addition of benzyl bromide. So the cuprate adds a phenyl group, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group via alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is used in a benzannulation reaction, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another approach: the cuprate adds a phenyl group via conjugate addition to C3, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group via alkylation to C2, which is the alpha position. So the product 2 would have a phenyl group on C3 and a benzyl group on C2.

But wait, the starting product already had a substituent on C4 (the TBS group). So product 2 would have substituents on C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), and C4 (TBS). Plus the ketone at C1.

Then, step 3: product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates. Iodomethane is a methylating agent, typically used to methylate enolates.

So, in this step, LDA would deprotonate the alpha position (maybe C2 or C5 or C6) to form an enolate, which would then react with iodomethane to add a methyl group.

Wait, but product 2 has a benzyl group on C2 and a phenyl on C3. So the enolate formation would probably occur at another alpha position, perhaps C5 or C6, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the enolate would form at a position alpha to the ketone, which is at C1. So possible positions are C2 and C6 (since C3 is already substituted with phenyl, C4 with TBS, and C5 is adjacent to C4 and might not be as acidic. Alternatively, C6 could be deprotonated.

So, when LDA is added, it would deprotonate the most acidic alpha hydrogen. The acidity of alpha hydrogens can vary based on substituents. The substituents on C2 (benzyl) and C3 (phenyl) may make the adjacent hydrogens more acidic.

Wait, but in product 2, the structure is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one. So the positions adjacent to the ketone (C1) are C2 and C6. C2 has a benzyl group, which is an electron-donating group, which would typically make the alpha hydrogens less acidic. Wait, but wait, actually, the benzyl group is an electron-donating group via conjugation, which would decrease acidity. So the alpha hydrogens at C2 might be less acidic than others.

C6 is another alpha position. The substituents there are less bulky, so perhaps C6 is more acidic. So LDA would deprotonate C6, forming an enolate at C6.

So, when LDA deprotonates C6, it forms an enolate with the negative charge on C5 and the double bond between C5 and C6. Then, iodomethane (CH3I) would attack the enolate, adding a methyl group to C5.

Wait, no, the enolate is at C6. So the attack would be at C5. So the methyl group would be added to C5.

Wait, no, when the enolate is formed, the negative charge is on C5, and the adjacent C6 is deprotonated. So the methyl group would add to C5. Or wait, perhaps C6.

Wait, no, when the enolate is formed at C6, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C5H- (with the negative charge on C5 and a double bond between C5 and C6). So when CH3I is added, the methyl group would attack the carbonyl carbon? No, wait, the enolate is a conjugate base. The methyl iodide would methylate the alpha carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. The enolate would have the negative charge on C5, and the double bond between C5 and C6. So when CH3I is added, the methyl would add to C5, making it a quaternary carbon?

Wait, but C5 is already substituted with a hydrogen, or perhaps another substituent. Hmm.

Wait, product 2 has substituents on C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), and C4 (TBS). So C5 is part of the ring but not substituted yet. So adding a methyl to C5 would give a substituent there.

Then, after the methylation, product 3 would have a methyl group on C5.

The next step is treating with aqueous HCl. That would protonate any enolates and also cleave any silyl ethers. Wait, because TBS groups are usually removed under acidic conditions. So the TBS group on C4 would be cleaved, giving back a hydroxyl group.

So, putting it all together, what's the structure of product 4?

Let me try to outline the structure:

Starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.

After silylation: 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

After Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide: 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to C2.

So after step 2, product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 3: treating with LDA and CH3I. LDA deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, forms an enolate, which then reacts with CH3I to add a methyl group.

Assuming LDA deprotonates C6, the enolate would form at C5, leading to methyl addition at C5.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the positions are such that the substituents are in a chair-like structure. So adding a methyl to C5 would make it adjacent to C4 (TBS) and C6.

But when the silyl group is removed in step 4 (HCl), the hydroxyl group (OH) would be formed at C4.

So, product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

Wait, but the options given have substituents in different positions. Let me look at the options.

Option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

So here, substituents are at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 6 (methyl).

Option B: (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Substituents at 2 (benzyl and methyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH). So this would have two groups at C2.

Option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Again, two substituents at C2 (benzyl and methyl), plus phenyl at 3 and OH at 4.

Option D: (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol

Hmm, that seems more complex, possibly a fused ring or different structure.

So, according to my earlier analysis, product 4 has substituents at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 5 (methyl). Looking at the options, that doesn't match any of them. Because option A has substituent at 6 (methyl), but I thought methyl is at 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the position where the methyl is added.

Wait, maybe during the enolate formation, the deprotonation happens at a different position. Let me think about the structure of product 2 again.

Product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

When LDA is added, which is a strong, bulky base, it tends to deprotonate the less hindered alpha position. In this case, where are the alpha hydrogens?

The ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. But C2 has a benzyl group, which might make the alpha hydrogen less available due to steric hindrance. So perhaps LDA deprotonates C6, which is less substituted.

So, after deprotonation at C6, the enolate would form between C5 and C6, with the negative charge on C5.

Then, methyl iodide would methylate at C5, leading to a methyl group on C5.

So, product 3 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (TBS), and C5 (methyl).

Then, treatment with HCl would remove the TBS group (cleaving it to OH), so product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

Looking at the options, none have substituents at C5. So either I'm wrong about the position, or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the methyl is added to a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate is formed at C2, but that seems unlikely because of the bulky substituents.

Wait, perhaps the LDA doesn't form an enolate but instead abstracts a proton elsewhere. Or perhaps the methyl adds to the benzyl group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again about the numbering of the cyclohexane ring.

In the starting material, the ring is cyclohex-2-en-1-one, so the ketone is at C1, the double bond between C2 and C3.

After the TBS protection, the substituents are at C4 (TBS), C2 and C3 being part of the double bond.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that when the methyl is added, it ends up on C6.

Wait, perhaps during the LDA treatment, the enolate is formed at C2, but that's a possibility only if the hydrogen is more acidic. But C2 has a benzyl group, which is bulky and possibly less acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl adds to C2, but that would require deprotonation at a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chair conformation. In the enolate, the more substituted position might be favored due to stability. Alternatively, maybe the base attacks the less hindered position.

Wait, another idea: the enolate formed could be at C5, and the methyl adds there. But when I look at the final product, after treatment with HCl, the substituents would be at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 5 (methyl). But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me reevaluate the steps.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction (step 2) adds the benzyl group via the benzyl bromide. So, step 2 is: after silylation, treatment with Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide.

Wait, maybe the sequence is a conjugate addition of the cuprate (adding phenyl to C3), followed by alkylation of the alpha position (C2) with benzyl bromide.

So, product 2 would be 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 3: treating with LDA and CH3I.

Assuming LDA deprotonates the alpha hydrogen at C6, adds methyl to C5.

Product 3 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (TBS), and C5 (methyl).

Then, HCl treatment removes TBS to give OH at C4, and the structure becomes 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylcyclohexan-1-one.

But looking at the options, none have substituent at C5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the methyl adds to the same carbon as the benzyl group, making C2 have both benzyl and methyl groups.

But in that case, the enolate would have to form at C2, which is less likely due to steric hindrance.

Wait, perhaps the LDA is used to deprotonate a different position, like C5 or C6, but I'm not seeing the substitution in the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 6-methyl.

So, if the methyl is at C6, that would explain option A.

How could the methyl end up at C6?

Perhaps during the LDA treatment, the enolate forms at C5, leading to the methyl group being added at C6.

Wait, wait, when the enolate is formed at C5 and C6, the attack of CH3I would add the methyl to the alpha carbon, which is C5. So that would make the methyl at C5, not C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate is at C6, leading to the methyl adding to C5. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial cyclohexenone is converted into a cyclohexanol derivative after silylation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions I'm considering are wrong, and the numbering is different.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's think about the structure again.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and a hydroxyl group on C4 (S configuration).

After silylation, product 1 is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

In step 2, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi (a cuprate) and benzyl bromide. The cuprate would add a phenyl group via conjugate addition to C3, and then benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group via alkylation to C2.

So product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

In step 3, product 2 is treated with LDA and CH3I. LDA, a strong base, deprotonates an alpha hydrogen. The alpha positions are C2 and C6.

C2 is already substituted with a benzyl group, which makes the alpha hydrogen there less acidic. So perhaps LDA deprotonates C6, which is not substituted.

Deprotonation at C6 forms an enolate between C5 and C6. The negative charge is on C5. Then, methyl iodide would methylate C5, adding a methyl group there.

So product 3 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-5-methylcyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 4: treatment with aqueous HCl would protonate any enolates and remove the TBS group, giving a hydroxyl group at C4.

So product 4 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylcyclohex-1-one.

Looking at the options, none of them have a substituent on C5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added to C6 instead of C5.

Wait, maybe the enolate forms at C5, and the methyl adds to C6. How?

Wait, when LDA deprotonates C6, the enolate would be between C5 and C6, with the negative charge on C5. Then, when methyl iodide attacks, it would add the methyl to C5, not C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, but that's difficult because of the benzyl group.

Another possibility: perhaps the methyl adds to C2, but that would require deprotonation at a neighboring position.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C3? No, C3 has a phenyl group; that's not an alpha position to the ketone.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl group is added via the benzyl bromide in a different step.

Wait, maybe in step 2, the benzyl bromide is added before the cuprate. But the question says product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi followed by benzyl bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is a 1,2-addition rather than 1,4.

Wait, no, cuprates typically do 1,4-additions to enones.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the cuprate, then the benzyl bromide adds via alkylation to the alpha position.

So, the product 2 would have a phenyl group on C3 and a benzyl group on C2.

Then, step 3: LDA deprotonates to form an enolate at C6, adds methyl to C5.

Step 4: remove TBS to get OH at C4.

So, product 4: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 5-methyl. No option matches that.

Looking at the options again, option A has a methyl at C6, which would mean the methyl is added there. How?

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C5, leading to the methyl adding at C6. How?

Wait, the enolate would have the double bond between C5 and C6. The negative charge is on C5. When CH3I is added, the methyl would add to C5, making it C5-Me.

So, product 3 would have a methyl at C5, and after TBS removal, product 4 would have OH at C4 and Me at C5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the methyl is added elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds a benzyl group instead of phenyl, but I don't think that's correct because Ph2CuLi is diphenyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group, but then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to the same carbon via a different mechanism, like a substitution.

Wait, but the C3 already has a phenyl group. So substitution would require a leaving group, which isn't present unless the TBS group is involved. But the TBS group is on C4, not C3.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate the entire process.

Another approach: think about each step's possible products.

Step 1: Protects the OH group with TBS.

Step 2: Using Ph2CuLi (a strong base) would deprotonate the alpha positions. But perhaps in the presence of the enone, the cuprate adds to the beta position.

Wait, maybe the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then the benzyl bromide adds to C2 via an alkylation.

So, product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Step 3: Treating with LDA and CH3I. LDA deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, forming an enolate, which methylates.

Assuming the enolate is formed at C6, the methyl adds to C5.

Then, after removing the TBS group, product 4 has substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

But no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, but that's unlikely because of the benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the methyl adds to C2, leading to a gem-dimethyl, but that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at option A: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 6-methyl.

So, how would the methyl end up at C6?

Perhaps, during the enolate formation, the methyl adds to C6.

Wait, maybe the enolate is formed between C6 and C5, and the methyl adds to C6.

But then, how? Because the enolate would have the negative charge on C5, and the methyl would add to C5.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the final step.

After step 3, product 3 has a TBS group, benzyl at C2, phenyl at C3, and a methyl group somewhere else.

Then, in step 4, the TBS group is removed, giving OH at C4.

Looking at option A, which has substituents at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 6 (methyl).

So, in product 4, methyl is at C6. How would that happen?

Perhaps, during step 3, the enolate formed was at C6, and the methyl adds to C6.

Wait, if the enolate is formed between C6 and C5, with the negative charge on C6, then CH3I would add to C6.

But in that case, the enolate would have the negative charge on C6, which is possible if LDA abstracts a proton from C6.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the enolate formation from C6 would require deprotonating a hydrogen that's alpha to the ketone. So, yes, C6 is alpha.

So, LDA would deprotonate C6, forming an enolate with the negative charge on C6. Then, CH3I would add a methyl group to C6.

So, product 3 would have a methyl group at C6.

Then, after removing the TBS group (step 4), product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (OH), and C6 (methyl).

Which matches option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

So, I think option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Each step modifies the structure, and the goal is to determine the final product after all transformations.

### Step 1: Silylation with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine
The hydroxyl group at C4 is protected as a silyl ether, forming **4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one**.

### Step 2: Treatment with Ph₂CuLi and benzyl bromide
Ph₂CuLi, a cuprate reagent, performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition) to the enone system. The phenyl group from the cuprate adds to C3, and benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to C2. The product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one**.

### Step 3: Treatment with LDA and iodomethane
LDA, a strong base, deprotonates the most acidic alpha hydrogen. Given the substituents, the less hindered alpha hydrogen at C6 is deprotonated, forming an enolate between C5 and C6. Iodomethane then methylates the alpha carbon, adding a methyl group to C6. The product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-6-methylcyclohex-1-one**.

### Step 4: Treatment with aqueous HCl
The TBS group is cleaved under acidic conditions, restoring the hydroxyl group at C4. The final product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylcyclohex-1-one**.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Matches the final structure, with substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (OH), and C6 (methyl).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it places a methyl group at C2, which is not supported by the reaction sequence.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it also places a methyl group at C2 and does not match the final structure.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what’s going on.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Then, it’s treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine to form product 1. Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temp, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temp to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl to give product 4. The question is about the structure of product 4, with four options provided.

Alright, so I need to break down each reaction step and see how the structure changes each time.

First, the starting compound is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. That's a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4 and a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The configuration is S at the 4 position, which I should note.

Step 1: Treating with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine. TBS-Cl is a silylating agent, commonly used to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine is a base, so it probably deprotonates the hydroxyl group to make it a better nucleophile for the silylation. So, the hydroxyl group on C4 would be replaced by a TBS group. So product 1 would be the TBS protected derivative of 4-hydroxy. So the structure now is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is typically used in conjugate additions. Conjugate addition (like a 1,4-addition) would happen to the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) system. The enone here is the cyclohexenone. The Gilman reagent adds a benzyl group, I think, because after the addition of the Gilman reagent, they often add an electrophile.

Wait, wait, Ph2CuLi is a cuprate reagent. It does a conjugate addition. So in the enone, the cuprate would add to the beta position (C3), and the lithium would pick up a proton from somewhere, maybe the alpha position (C2). But wait, cyclohexenone is a 2-enone, so the enone is between C1 (the ketone) and C2-C3 double bond.

So the mechanism would involve the cuprate attacking the beta carbon (C3), and then the leaving group (like the alpha proton) would be abstracted, forming a new bond. But wait, the cuprate is a strong base as well. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the conjugate addition without deprotonation.

Wait, no, the typical 1,4 addition with cuprates would add the R group (like the aryl or benzyl group) to the beta carbon, and the conjugate base would form a new carbon-carbon bond. So in this case, the cuprate (Ph2CuLi) would add to the beta position (C3) of the enone.

But wait, the starting product after silylation is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So when the cuprate adds, it would target the beta position (C3). So the cuprate (which has a benzyl group, from the Ph2CuLi?) Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is a diphenyl cuprate. So the R group added would be a phenyl?

Wait, no. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is a cuprate where the R is phenyl. But the next step is adding benzyl bromide. Oh, right, so maybe the cuprate does a conjugate addition to the enone, and then the benzyl bromide would alkylate at the alpha position.

Wait, perhaps the procedure is a two-step process. First, the cuprate adds to the enone, then the benzyl bromide is added as an electrophile.

Wait, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds to the enone, and then the benzyl bromide acts as an electrophile in an alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The cuprate adds in a conjugate fashion to the enone, and the benzyl bromide is perhaps an electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group. But wait, the second step is benzyl bromide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is a conjugate addition followed by alkylation. Let me think: The cuprate (Ph2CuLi) adds a benzyl group via conjugate addition, but wait, no, the cuprate is diphenyl, so it's adding a phenyl group. But then after that, benzyl bromide would be an alkylating agent, perhaps adding another group.

Wait, maybe the first step is a 1,4-addition of the cuprate to the enone, forming a new bond between the cuprate's R (Ph) and the beta carbon (C3). Then, the benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group somewhere else.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps after the cuprate adds, the benzyl bromide is used for an alkylation. Let me think: when the cuprate adds to the enone, it forms an alkoxide intermediate. Then, perhaps this is quenched with benzyl bromide, leading to alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the overall process. The starting compound is a cyclohexenone with a TBS group on C4.

In the presence of a strong base like Ph2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile, the enolate might form, but I think the cuprate does a conjugate addition. The cuprate would add to the beta position (C3), and then the benzyl bromide would perhaps alkylate the alpha position (C2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds the benzyl group to the beta carbon, but wait, the cuprate is diphenyl, not benzyl. So maybe the cuprate adds a phenyl group, and then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the first step is adding the phenyl group via the cuprate, and then the benzyl is added via the benzyl bromide. But where?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi is diphenyl, so the R group is phenyl, not benzyl. So, perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to another position.

Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds to the enone, and the benzyl bromide is used in a Stille coupling or something else. No, I think it's more likely an alkylation.

Wait, perhaps after the cuprate adds, the resulting compound has a new phenyl group on C3, and then benzyl bromide would alkylate, perhaps the alpha position (C2) via an SN2 mechanism.

But wait, cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone. The positions are numbered such that the ketone is at C1, double bond between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl (now protected as TBS) at C4.

So, the starting structure (product 1) is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

When treated with Ph2CuLi (a strong base and nucleophile), it would likely perform a conjugate addition. The cuprate adds to the beta carbon (C3), and the alpha proton (from C2) is abstracted as a base, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but if the cuprate is diphenyl, it would add a phenyl group to C3. So the structure would have a phenyl group attached to C3.

But wait, the product after this step (product 2) would have this phenyl group. Then, after adding benzyl bromide, perhaps another alkylation occurs.

Wait, but benzyl bromide is a good electrophile. Maybe after the cuprate adds, the benzyl bromide is used to perform an alkylation at another position, perhaps the alpha position (C2) or the gamma position (C5 or C6).

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide adds via an enolate.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: first, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to the alpha position (C2) via an enolate.

But in any case, after these steps, product 2 would have a phenyl group at C3 and a benzyl group at C2.

Wait, but let me think about the mechanism. The cuprate (Ph2CuLi) would attack the beta carbon (C3) of the enone, opening the double bond. The Li would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (C2), leading to a conjugate addition. So the product would have a new bond between the phenyl group (from the cuprate) and C3.

Wait, no. The cuprate adds the R group (Ph) to the beta carbon, and the alpha carbon (C2) becomes deprotonated. But then, what happens with the benzyl bromide?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent that adds to the enolate. So after the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, the molecule would have a new structure. Then, the next step would form an enolate, which would attack benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added after the cuprate. So first, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, making product 2a. Then, perhaps the enolate is formed, which attacks benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group to C2.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyl bromide is added without the enolate, but maybe as an SN2 reaction on a good leaving group. But wait, in this molecule, the only leaving group is the TBS group on C4. But that's a silyl ether, which isn't a good leaving group unless acid is present.

Hmm, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added in an alkylation after the cuprate addition. So perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, making that a new substituent. Then the benzyl bromide is added as an electrophilic benzyl group to another position.

Wait, maybe the benzyl group adds to the alpha position (C2). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added via a different mechanism. Another possibility is that, after the cuprate addition, the molecule undergoes some ring-opening or rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall transformations. The first step is silylation, so the OH becomes TBS. Then, in step 2, a conjugate addition occurs, adding a phenyl group. Then, benzyl bromide comes in. Oh! Wait, perhaps the step after the cuprate addition is a Michael addition of benzyl bromide. So the cuprate adds a phenyl group, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group via alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is used in a benzannulation reaction, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another approach: the cuprate adds a phenyl group via conjugate addition to C3, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group via alkylation to C2, which is the alpha position. So the product 2 would have a phenyl group on C3 and a benzyl group on C2.

But wait, the starting product already had a substituent on C4 (the TBS group). So product 2 would have substituents on C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), and C4 (TBS). Plus the ketone at C1.

Then, step 3: product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates. Iodomethane is a methylating agent, typically used to methylate enolates.

So, in this step, LDA would deprotonate the alpha position (maybe C2 or C5 or C6) to form an enolate, which would then react with iodomethane to add a methyl group.

Wait, but product 2 has a benzyl group on C2 and a phenyl on C3. So the enolate formation would probably occur at another alpha position, perhaps C5 or C6, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the enolate would form at a position alpha to the ketone, which is at C1. So possible positions are C2 and C6 (since C3 is already substituted with phenyl, C4 with TBS, and C5 is adjacent to C4 and might not be as acidic. Alternatively, C6 could be deprotonated.

So, when LDA is added, it would deprotonate the most acidic alpha hydrogen. The acidity of alpha hydrogens can vary based on substituents. The substituents on C2 (benzyl) and C3 (phenyl) may make the adjacent hydrogens more acidic.

Wait, but in product 2, the structure is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one. So the positions adjacent to the ketone (C1) are C2 and C6. C2 has a benzyl group, which is an electron-donating group, which would typically make the alpha hydrogens less acidic. Wait, but wait, actually, the benzyl group is an electron-donating group via conjugation, which would decrease acidity. So the alpha hydrogens at C2 might be less acidic than others.

C6 is another alpha position. The substituents there are less bulky, so perhaps C6 is more acidic. So LDA would deprotonate C6, forming an enolate at C6.

So, when LDA deprotonates C6, it forms an enolate with the negative charge on C5 and the double bond between C5 and C6. Then, iodomethane (CH3I) would attack the enolate, adding a methyl group to C5.

Wait, no, the enolate is at C6. So the attack would be at C5. So the methyl group would be added to C5.

Wait, no, when the enolate is formed, the negative charge is on C5, and the adjacent C6 is deprotonated. So the methyl group would add to C5. Or wait, perhaps C6.

Wait, no, when the enolate is formed at C6, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C5H- (with the negative charge on C5 and a double bond between C5 and C6). So when CH3I is added, the methyl group would attack the carbonyl carbon? No, wait, the enolate is a conjugate base. The methyl iodide would methylate the alpha carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. The enolate would have the negative charge on C5, and the double bond between C5 and C6. So when CH3I is added, the methyl would add to C5, making it a quaternary carbon?

Wait, but C5 is already substituted with a hydrogen, or perhaps another substituent. Hmm.

Wait, product 2 has substituents on C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), and C4 (TBS). So C5 is part of the ring but not substituted yet. So adding a methyl to C5 would give a substituent there.

Then, after the methylation, product 3 would have a methyl group on C5.

The next step is treating with aqueous HCl. That would protonate any enolates and also cleave any silyl ethers. Wait, because TBS groups are usually removed under acidic conditions. So the TBS group on C4 would be cleaved, giving back a hydroxyl group.

So, putting it all together, what's the structure of product 4?

Let me try to outline the structure:

Starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.

After silylation: 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

After Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide: 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to C2.

So after step 2, product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 3: treating with LDA and CH3I. LDA deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, forms an enolate, which then reacts with CH3I to add a methyl group.

Assuming LDA deprotonates C6, the enolate would form at C5, leading to methyl addition at C5.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the positions are such that the substituents are in a chair-like structure. So adding a methyl to C5 would make it adjacent to C4 (TBS) and C6.

But when the silyl group is removed in step 4 (HCl), the hydroxyl group (OH) would be formed at C4.

So, product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

Wait, but the options given have substituents in different positions. Let me look at the options.

Option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

So here, substituents are at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 6 (methyl).

Option B: (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Substituents at 2 (benzyl and methyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH). So this would have two groups at C2.

Option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Again, two substituents at C2 (benzyl and methyl), plus phenyl at 3 and OH at 4.

Option D: (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol

Hmm, that seems more complex, possibly a fused ring or different structure.

So, according to my earlier analysis, product 4 has substituents at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 5 (methyl). Looking at the options, that doesn't match any of them. Because option A has substituent at 6 (methyl), but I thought methyl is at 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the position where the methyl is added.

Wait, maybe during the enolate formation, the deprotonation happens at a different position. Let me think about the structure of product 2 again.

Product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

When LDA is added, which is a strong, bulky base, it tends to deprotonate the less hindered alpha position. In this case, where are the alpha hydrogens?

The ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. But C2 has a benzyl group, which might make the alpha hydrogen less available due to steric hindrance. So perhaps LDA deprotonates C6, which is less substituted.

So, after deprotonation at C6, the enolate would form between C5 and C6, with the negative charge on C5.

Then, methyl iodide would methylate at C5, leading to a methyl group on C5.

So, product 3 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (TBS), and C5 (methyl).

Then, treatment with HCl would remove the TBS group (cleaving it to OH), so product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

Looking at the options, none have substituents at C5. So either I'm wrong about the position, or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the methyl is added to a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate is formed at C2, but that seems unlikely because of the bulky substituents.

Wait, perhaps the LDA doesn't form an enolate but instead abstracts a proton elsewhere. Or perhaps the methyl adds to the benzyl group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again about the numbering of the cyclohexane ring.

In the starting material, the ring is cyclohex-2-en-1-one, so the ketone is at C1, the double bond between C2 and C3.

After the TBS protection, the substituents are at C4 (TBS), C2 and C3 being part of the double bond.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that when the methyl is added, it ends up on C6.

Wait, perhaps during the LDA treatment, the enolate is formed at C2, but that's a possibility only if the hydrogen is more acidic. But C2 has a benzyl group, which is bulky and possibly less acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl adds to C2, but that would require deprotonation at a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chair conformation. In the enolate, the more substituted position might be favored due to stability. Alternatively, maybe the base attacks the less hindered position.

Wait, another idea: the enolate formed could be at C5, and the methyl adds there. But when I look at the final product, after treatment with HCl, the substituents would be at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 5 (methyl). But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me reevaluate the steps.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction (step 2) adds the benzyl group via the benzyl bromide. So, step 2 is: after silylation, treatment with Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide.

Wait, maybe the sequence is a conjugate addition of the cuprate (adding phenyl to C3), followed by alkylation of the alpha position (C2) with benzyl bromide.

So, product 2 would be 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 3: treating with LDA and CH3I.

Assuming LDA deprotonates the alpha hydrogen at C6, adds methyl to C5.

Product 3 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (TBS), and C5 (methyl).

Then, HCl treatment removes TBS to give OH at C4, and the structure becomes 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylcyclohexan-1-one.

But looking at the options, none have substituent at C5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the methyl adds to the same carbon as the benzyl group, making C2 have both benzyl and methyl groups.

But in that case, the enolate would have to form at C2, which is less likely due to steric hindrance.

Wait, perhaps the LDA is used to deprotonate a different position, like C5 or C6, but I'm not seeing the substitution in the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 6-methyl.

So, if the methyl is at C6, that would explain option A.

How could the methyl end up at C6?

Perhaps during the LDA treatment, the enolate forms at C5, leading to the methyl group being added at C6.

Wait, wait, when the enolate is formed at C5 and C6, the attack of CH3I would add the methyl to the alpha carbon, which is C5. So that would make the methyl at C5, not C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate is at C6, leading to the methyl adding to C5. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial cyclohexenone is converted into a cyclohexanol derivative after silylation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions I'm considering are wrong, and the numbering is different.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's think about the structure again.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and a hydroxyl group on C4 (S configuration).

After silylation, product 1 is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

In step 2, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi (a cuprate) and benzyl bromide. The cuprate would add a phenyl group via conjugate addition to C3, and then benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group via alkylation to C2.

So product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

In step 3, product 2 is treated with LDA and CH3I. LDA, a strong base, deprotonates an alpha hydrogen. The alpha positions are C2 and C6.

C2 is already substituted with a benzyl group, which makes the alpha hydrogen there less acidic. So perhaps LDA deprotonates C6, which is not substituted.

Deprotonation at C6 forms an enolate between C5 and C6. The negative charge is on C5. Then, methyl iodide would methylate C5, adding a methyl group there.

So product 3 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-5-methylcyclohex-1-one.

Then, step 4: treatment with aqueous HCl would protonate any enolates and remove the TBS group, giving a hydroxyl group at C4.

So product 4 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylcyclohex-1-one.

Looking at the options, none of them have a substituent on C5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added to C6 instead of C5.

Wait, maybe the enolate forms at C5, and the methyl adds to C6. How?

Wait, when LDA deprotonates C6, the enolate would be between C5 and C6, with the negative charge on C5. Then, when methyl iodide attacks, it would add the methyl to C5, not C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, but that's difficult because of the benzyl group.

Another possibility: perhaps the methyl adds to C2, but that would require deprotonation at a neighboring position.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C3? No, C3 has a phenyl group; that's not an alpha position to the ketone.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl group is added via the benzyl bromide in a different step.

Wait, maybe in step 2, the benzyl bromide is added before the cuprate. But the question says product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi followed by benzyl bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is a 1,2-addition rather than 1,4.

Wait, no, cuprates typically do 1,4-additions to enones.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the cuprate, then the benzyl bromide adds via alkylation to the alpha position.

So, the product 2 would have a phenyl group on C3 and a benzyl group on C2.

Then, step 3: LDA deprotonates to form an enolate at C6, adds methyl to C5.

Step 4: remove TBS to get OH at C4.

So, product 4: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 5-methyl. No option matches that.

Looking at the options again, option A has a methyl at C6, which would mean the methyl is added there. How?

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C5, leading to the methyl adding at C6. How?

Wait, the enolate would have the double bond between C5 and C6. The negative charge is on C5. When CH3I is added, the methyl would add to C5, making it C5-Me.

So, product 3 would have a methyl at C5, and after TBS removal, product 4 would have OH at C4 and Me at C5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the methyl is added elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the cuprate adds a benzyl group instead of phenyl, but I don't think that's correct because Ph2CuLi is diphenyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cuprate adds a phenyl group, but then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to the same carbon via a different mechanism, like a substitution.

Wait, but the C3 already has a phenyl group. So substitution would require a leaving group, which isn't present unless the TBS group is involved. But the TBS group is on C4, not C3.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate the entire process.

Another approach: think about each step's possible products.

Step 1: Protects the OH group with TBS.

Step 2: Using Ph2CuLi (a strong base) would deprotonate the alpha positions. But perhaps in the presence of the enone, the cuprate adds to the beta position.

Wait, maybe the cuprate adds a phenyl group to C3, and then the benzyl bromide adds to C2 via an alkylation.

So, product 2 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one.

Step 3: Treating with LDA and CH3I. LDA deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, forming an enolate, which methylates.

Assuming the enolate is formed at C6, the methyl adds to C5.

Then, after removing the TBS group, product 4 has substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (OH).

But no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, but that's unlikely because of the benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps the methyl adds to C2, leading to a gem-dimethyl, but that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at option A: 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-OH, 6-methyl.

So, how would the methyl end up at C6?

Perhaps, during the enolate formation, the methyl adds to C6.

Wait, maybe the enolate is formed between C6 and C5, and the methyl adds to C6.

But then, how? Because the enolate would have the negative charge on C5, and the methyl would add to C5.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the final step.

After step 3, product 3 has a TBS group, benzyl at C2, phenyl at C3, and a methyl group somewhere else.

Then, in step 4, the TBS group is removed, giving OH at C4.

Looking at option A, which has substituents at 2 (benzyl), 3 (phenyl), 4 (OH), and 6 (methyl).

So, in product 4, methyl is at C6. How would that happen?

Perhaps, during step 3, the enolate formed was at C6, and the methyl adds to C6.

Wait, if the enolate is formed between C6 and C5, with the negative charge on C6, then CH3I would add to C6.

But in that case, the enolate would have the negative charge on C6, which is possible if LDA abstracts a proton from C6.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the enolate formation from C6 would require deprotonating a hydrogen that's alpha to the ketone. So, yes, C6 is alpha.

So, LDA would deprotonate C6, forming an enolate with the negative charge on C6. Then, CH3I would add a methyl group to C6.

So, product 3 would have a methyl group at C6.

Then, after removing the TBS group (step 4), product 4 would have substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (OH), and C6 (methyl).

Which matches option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

So, I think option A is the correct answer.


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Each step modifies the structure, and the goal is to determine the final product after all transformations.

### Step 1: Silylation with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine
The hydroxyl group at C4 is protected as a silyl ether, forming **4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one**.

### Step 2: Treatment with Ph₂CuLi and benzyl bromide
Ph₂CuLi, a cuprate reagent, performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition) to the enone system. The phenyl group from the cuprate adds to C3, and benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to C2. The product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-cyclohex-1-one**.

### Step 3: Treatment with LDA and iodomethane
LDA, a strong base, deprotonates the most acidic alpha hydrogen. Given the substituents, the less hindered alpha hydrogen at C6 is deprotonated, forming an enolate between C5 and C6. Iodomethane then methylates the alpha carbon, adding a methyl group to C6. The product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-TBS-6-methylcyclohex-1-one**.

### Step 4: Treatment with aqueous HCl
The TBS group is cleaved under acidic conditions, restoring the hydroxyl group at C4. The final product is **2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylcyclohex-1-one**.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Matches the final structure, with substituents at C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), C4 (OH), and C6 (methyl).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it places a methyl group at C2, which is not supported by the reaction sequence.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it also places a methyl group at C2 and does not match the final structure.
