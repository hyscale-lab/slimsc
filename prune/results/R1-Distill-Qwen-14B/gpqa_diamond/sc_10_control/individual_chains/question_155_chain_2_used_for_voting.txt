Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz for an operator Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think means that the states are expressed in the z-basis.

First, let's recap what I know about uncertainties and operators. The uncertainty ΔA for an operator A is given by the square root of the expectation value of A squared minus the square of the expectation value of A. So mathematically, ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So this is a three-component vector, which makes me think it's a three-level system, maybe spin-1 or something similar. The basis states are the eigenvectors of Pz, so each component of the state vector corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of Pz.

Wait, the operator Pz is given as a matrix with [ [ℏ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ℏ] ]. So the eigenvalues of Pz are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, since the matrix is diagonal. So the basis states are |+⟩ = (1,0,0), |0⟩ = (0,1,0), and |-⟩ = (0,0,1).

The state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1.

Calculating that: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, since the uncertainty in Pz is required, and the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So let's compute ⟨Pz⟩ first. Each component of the state is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. So the probabilities are |amplitude|^2.

Wait, wait. The state is in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, so each component corresponds directly to the eigenstate. So:

- The first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ℏ.
- The second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0.
- The third component is -1/2, the amplitude for eigenvalue -ℏ.

So the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ( (-1/2) * ℏ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ℏ) )

Wait, no, no. Wait, the expectation value is the sum of (probability) * (eigenvalue). So for each component, the probability is |amplitude|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no, the expectation value is sum ( |a_i|^2 * λ_i ), where a_i are the components, and λ_i the eigenvalues. Because each |a_i|^2 is the probability that the state is in the i-th eigenstate, and λ_i is the value of Pz in that state.

So calculating ⟨Pz⟩:

|a1|^2 * λ1 + |a2|^2 * λ2 + |a3|^2 * λ3.

Where a1 = -1/2, a2=1/sqrt(2), a3=-1/2.

So |a1|^2 is (1/2)^2? Wait, (-1/2) squared is 1/4. |a2|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |a3|^2 is again 1/4.

λ1 is ℏ, λ2 is 0, λ3 is -ℏ.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4) - (ℏ/4) = 0.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, its square is easy to compute. Pz² matrix is diagonal with entries (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, which are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

So:

(1/4)* (ℏ²) + (1/2)*(0) + (1/4)*(ℏ²) = (ℏ²/4) + (ℏ²/4) ) = (2 * ℏ²/4) ) = ℏ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ℏ²/2.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (ℏ²/2) - 0) ) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) ) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2), which would match this.

But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Let me recalculate ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

⟨Pz⟩:

( (-1/2)^2 * ℏ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ℏ) )

Wait, no, wait. The components are a1, a2, a3. So each a_i is the amplitude for eigenstate i, which has eigenvalue λ_i.

So for a1: |a1|^2 is (1/2)^2? No, wait, a1 is -1/2, so squared is 1/4. So |a1|^2 is 1/4. Similarly, |a3|^2 is 1/4.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4) - (ℏ/4) = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/4)*ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (2 * 1/4) ) * ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

Therefore, the variance is (1/2)ℏ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2)ℏ = ℏ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the matrix for Pz, the diagonal entries are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So when I calculate ⟨Pz²⟩, each term is |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2. So for the first term, (1/4) * (ℏ)^2 = ℏ²/4. Third term, (1/4) * ( (-ℏ)^2 ) = ℏ²/4. So yes, total is ℏ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(ℏ^2/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the amplitudes in the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|a_i|^2$ is the probability of being in the $i$-th eigenstate, and $\lambda_i$ is the corresponding eigenvalue. For the given state:

- $|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1 = \hbar$,
- $|a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2 = 0$,
- $|a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, and since $P_z$ is diagonal, $P_z^2$ is also diagonal with entries $(\hbar)^2$, $0^2$, and $(-\hbar)^2$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 (\lambda_i)^2.
\]

Using the same probabilities and eigenvalues as before:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz for an operator Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think means that the states are expressed in the z-basis.

First, let's recap what I know about uncertainties and operators. The uncertainty ΔA for an operator A is given by the square root of the expectation value of A squared minus the square of the expectation value of A. So mathematically, ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So this is a three-component vector, which makes me think it's a three-level system, maybe spin-1 or something similar. The basis states are the eigenvectors of Pz, so each component of the state vector corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of Pz.

Wait, the operator Pz is given as a matrix with [ [ℏ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ℏ] ]. So the eigenvalues of Pz are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, since the matrix is diagonal. So the basis states are |+⟩ = (1,0,0), |0⟩ = (0,1,0), and |-⟩ = (0,0,1).

The state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1.

Calculating that: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, since the uncertainty in Pz is required, and the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So let's compute ⟨Pz⟩ first. Each component of the state is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. So the probabilities are |amplitude|^2.

Wait, wait. The state is in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, so each component corresponds directly to the eigenstate. So:

- The first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ℏ.
- The second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0.
- The third component is -1/2, the amplitude for eigenvalue -ℏ.

So the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ( (-1/2) * ℏ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ℏ) )

Wait, no, no. Wait, the expectation value is the sum of (probability) * (eigenvalue). So for each component, the probability is |amplitude|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no, the expectation value is sum ( |a_i|^2 * λ_i ), where a_i are the components, and λ_i the eigenvalues. Because each |a_i|^2 is the probability that the state is in the i-th eigenstate, and λ_i is the value of Pz in that state.

So calculating ⟨Pz⟩:

|a1|^2 * λ1 + |a2|^2 * λ2 + |a3|^2 * λ3.

Where a1 = -1/2, a2=1/sqrt(2), a3=-1/2.

So |a1|^2 is (1/2)^2? Wait, (-1/2) squared is 1/4. |a2|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |a3|^2 is again 1/4.

λ1 is ℏ, λ2 is 0, λ3 is -ℏ.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4) - (ℏ/4) = 0.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, its square is easy to compute. Pz² matrix is diagonal with entries (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, which are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

So:

(1/4)* (ℏ²) + (1/2)*(0) + (1/4)*(ℏ²) = (ℏ²/4) + (ℏ²/4) ) = (2 * ℏ²/4) ) = ℏ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ℏ²/2.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (ℏ²/2) - 0) ) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) ) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2), which would match this.

But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

Let me recalculate ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

⟨Pz⟩:

( (-1/2)^2 * ℏ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ℏ) )

Wait, no, wait. The components are a1, a2, a3. So each a_i is the amplitude for eigenstate i, which has eigenvalue λ_i.

So for a1: |a1|^2 is (1/2)^2? No, wait, a1 is -1/2, so squared is 1/4. So |a1|^2 is 1/4. Similarly, |a3|^2 is 1/4.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4) - (ℏ/4) = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/4)*ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (2 * 1/4) ) * ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

Therefore, the variance is (1/2)ℏ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2)ℏ = ℏ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the matrix for Pz, the diagonal entries are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So when I calculate ⟨Pz²⟩, each term is |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2. So for the first term, (1/4) * (ℏ)^2 = ℏ²/4. Third term, (1/4) * ( (-ℏ)^2 ) = ℏ²/4. So yes, total is ℏ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(ℏ^2/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the amplitudes in the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|a_i|^2$ is the probability of being in the $i$-th eigenstate, and $\lambda_i$ is the corresponding eigenvalue. For the given state:

- $|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1 = \hbar$,
- $|a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2 = 0$,
- $|a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, and since $P_z$ is diagonal, $P_z^2$ is also diagonal with entries $(\hbar)^2$, $0^2$, and $(-\hbar)^2$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 (\lambda_i)^2.
\]

Using the same probabilities and eigenvalues as before:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
