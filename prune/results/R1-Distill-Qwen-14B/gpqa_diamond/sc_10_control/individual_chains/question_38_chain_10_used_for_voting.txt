Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds, right? They're useful for certain types of reactions, like maybe some kind of conjugate additions or maybe in forming rings.

The question gives me a starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down. The structure probably has an amine group attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group. Pentan-2-ylidene would be a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the second carbon, so it's CH2-CH2-CH-CH2-CH3, but wait, the position might be different. Actually, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ylidene group is =CH-, so pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(H)=CH-CH2-CH3? Hmm, not sure, but maybe it's something like that.

The reaction is with reagent A, and it forms product B. The options are about what B is and what the sequence of reagents is.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. B is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, LDA is a strong base, usually deprotonates things. DME is a solvent, I think. CH3CH2I is an alkylating agent, maybe an iodide. H3O+ is acidic workup.

Option B: Reagents are LDA first, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Same as A, same B.

Hmm, perhaps the order of reagents is different. Let's think about what the starting material is. The starting material is an enamine, right? Because it's N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, 'ethanaminium' suggests a protonated amine. So maybe it's an iminium ion.

Enamine formation typically involves a secondary amine reacting with a carbonyl. Wait, but this seems to be the enamine already. Or perhaps it's a cyclic enamine or something else.

Wait, the problem states that the reaction is an enamine reaction, and the reagents are A, which leads to product B. So A is a set of reagents applied to the starting enamine to form B.

Wait, but what's the purpose of the reagents? Let me think about the steps involved in using an enamine. Enamines are often used in the formation of rings, like the Stork enamine synthesis. But in this case, maybe the enamine is undergoing some kind of alkylation or another reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is an iminium ion, which can act as an electrophilic site. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is reacting with an electrophile.

Looking at the reagents in the options: LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent used in some deprotonation steps. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, which is a good alkylating agent. H3O+ is for acidic workup.

So, possible steps: The starting material is an enamine. Maybe it's being deprotonated by LDA to form an enamine lithium intermediate. Then, ethyl iodide could alkylate it. Then, acid workup would protonate it, and perhaps hydrolysis would occur.

Wait, but what about the structure of the starting material? Let me try to visualize it.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The ethanaminium part is CH3NH2+ with a methyl group attached. The pentan-2-ylidene group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, wait. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 with a double bond. Maybe it's (CH2)2-CH-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be penten-1-ylidene or something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as (E)- configuration. So, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. So the starting material has a structure where an ethanaminium group (CH2NHMe+) is attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a double bond in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+? Not sure, but maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. But perhaps that's getting off track.

So, the reaction is adding reagent A to this enamine. Let me think about the reagents in the options.

Option C: Reagents are LDA and DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one. Hmm, heptan-4-one is a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

Option D: Reagents are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, so options C and D have the same product, but different reagent sequences.

Wait, but what's the starting material? Let's think: the starting material is an enamine, which is derived from a secondary amine. When you react an enamine with an electrophile, the enamine acts as a nucleophile. But in some cases, you might deprotonate the enamine to make it a stronger base, then alkylate it.

Wait, another approach: the enamine could be undergoing alkylation. Enamines are used as nucleophiles. So, perhaps the starting material is treated with a base to deprotonate, then reacts with an alkyl halide (like CH3CH2I) to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Then, after alkylation, acid workup would protonate, and perhaps hydrolysis would occur to give a ketone or something else.

Wait, but the product in options A and B is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine. So maybe that's the result of hydrolysis of an enamine.

Wait, in the enamine reaction, when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get back the original carbonyl compound and the amine. So if the enamine is R2N-CH2-CR2, upon hydrolysis, you might get R2N-R plus a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, in this case, the starting material is an enamine (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So when you hydrolyze it, perhaps you get a ketone and an amine.

But the product in options A and B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no, pentan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-3-one. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The position of the ketone in pentan-2-one is on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, it's (CH2CH2CH2)COCH3? No, wait. No, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CHCOCH2CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me count: pentan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, pentan-2-one would have the ketone group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, CH2(CO) is the second carbon. Wait, wait, pentan-2-one: the five-carbon chain with the ketone on C2. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, that's correct.

Wait, but if the starting enamine is hydrolyzed, would that give pentan-2-one and a secondary amine?

Let's think: Enamine formation is usually from a secondary amine and a ketone. The enamine is R2N-CH2-CH(R')-R''. Then, when you hydrolyze it, you get back the ketone R2C=O and the amine R''NH2.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is the enamine already. So perhaps when you add acid, it will hydrolyze back to the original components.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So, the enamine must have been formed from a ketone and a secondary amine.

Wait, let me think: the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure would be something like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3) as a substituent on a double bond, connected to an NMe2+ group.

Wait, maybe the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. For instance, if you have a secondary amine like N,N-dimethylethanamine (CH3)2NH and a carbonyl, say, pentan-2-one, the enamine would form.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction steps.

The reaction as per the question is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A → B.

So, what's happening here? The starting material is an enamine. When you treat an enamine with certain reagents, you can perform various reactions. One possibility is the Michael addition, but that's when the enamine attacks an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is undergoing alkylation.

Wait, another approach: in the presence of a strong base like LDA, the enamine can be deprotonated. Then, an alkylating agent like ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) can add, leading to an alkylation of the enamine. Then, upon hydrolysis with acid (H3O+), you might get a new ketone.

Let's think about each step:

1. Using LDA (a strong base) to deprotonate the enamine. Enamines are typically less acidic than amines but more acidic than alkanes. LDA is a strong enough base to deprotonate them.

2. Then, adding ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), which would alkylate the deprotonated enamine. So, the enamine's nitrogen (or the adjacent carbon) would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to an alkylation.

3. Then, acid workup (H3O+) would protonate and possibly hydrolyze the enamine, leading to a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the enamine is CH2=C-(R)-NMe2+, after deprotonation and alkylation, perhaps the ethyl group adds to the nitrogen, making it CH2=C-(R)-NMe2Et+. Then, upon hydrolysis, this would split into a ketone and the amine.

Alternatively, maybe the alkylation is on the carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is:

CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+.

So, when you deprotonate that with LDA, you get a carbanion adjacent to the double bond. Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate the carbon, adding an ethyl group. So, the structure becomes CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-Et-NMe2+.

Wait, perhaps. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and the amine.

Wait, but how would that work? Enamine hydrolysis typically requires acid. So, after adding ethyl iodide, when you do H3O+, the enamine would hydrolyze to form a ketone and the corresponding amine.

But wait, the initial enamine is (E)-configured. So, after alkylation, maybe the structure becomes longer. Let's think about the product.

If the starting enamine is derived from a ketone and a secondary amine, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would increase the chain length. Then hydrolysis would give a larger ketone.

In the options, option C and D have product B as heptan-4-one. So, a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

How would that happen? Let's think. The starting material's enamine is perhaps derived from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine. So, when you alkylate it, you add an ethyl group, making the chain longer.

Wait, let me outline:

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Reaction steps:

1. Deprotonate with LDA → enamine becomes more nucleophilic.

2. Alkylation with CH3CH2I → adds an ethyl group.

3. Acid workup → hydrolysis to a ketone and amine.

So, the hydrolysis would give a new ketone. The original ketone was pentan-2-one (five carbons). Adding an ethyl group via alkylation would increase the chain length.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+ which is derived from a five-carbon ketone (like pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine.

When you alkylate that, say, add an ethyl group to the nitrogen? Or to the carbon chain? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine has a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a double bond, and after alkylation, the carbon chain extends.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is part of a conjugated system. So, after alkylation, you get a longer chain, and upon hydrolysis, you'd get a ketone that's longer.

So, starting material: pentan-2-one (five carbons) and dimethylamine. Enamine is (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+. Then, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would make the chain longer, leading to a heptan-4-one after hydrolysis.

Because the original ketone was five carbons, and adding two more (ethyl is two carbons?), but wait, ethyl is CH2CH3. So, perhaps the ketone becomes seven carbons.

Wait, let's count. Suppose the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. The enamine would have the structure CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+.

When you alkylate, adding an ethyl group, perhaps to the nitrogen, making it NMe2CH2CH2+.

Wait, but how does that translate into the ketone after hydrolysis? Maybe when you hydrolyze, the nitrogen is released as the amine, and the carbonyl is formed from the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds to the carbon chain.

For example, the enamine is CH2=C-(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+. Alkylating the carbon adjacent to the double bond (the carbanion from LDA deprotonation) with ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group there, making the structure CH2=C-CH2CH2CH3-CH2CH2-NMe2+. Then, upon hydrolysis, the nitrogen is split off, giving a ketone.

Wait, but how? Hydrolysis of the enamine would typically break the C-N bond, leading to a carbonyl group. So, the R group attached to the double bond would become the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of the enamine as R2C=CR-NR2. Hydrolysis would produce R2C=O and NR2R.

Wait, but maybe in this case, after alkylation, you have a longer chain.

So, the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. So, the enamine structure is (CH2CH2CH3)C=CH-NMe2+ or something like that.

After alkylation, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the central carbon, making it longer.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the product options.

Options C and D have product B as heptan-4-one, which is a seven-carbon ketone with the ketone group on carbon 4: CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, wait, no. Heptan-4-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So, that's seven carbons in total, with the ketone on C4.

So, how does that form?

The starting enamine is made from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine. Then, perhaps the alkylation adds two more carbons (from ethyl iodide, but ethyl is two carbons) but that may not add two carbons. Wait, ethyl iodide is CH3CH2I. So, adding an ethyl group would add two carbons.

Wait, let me think: starting with a five-carbon enamine, adding two carbons via alkylation would make a seven-carbon compound. Then, hydrolysis would give a seven-carbon ketone.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one, which matches options C and D.

So, the steps would be: deprotonate the enamine with LDA, then alkylate with ethyl iodide, then acid workup to hydrolyze.

But looking at the options:

Option C: Reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the difference between C and D is the order of steps. Option C's reagent A is three steps: LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Option D's reagent A is LDA, followed by DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ all in step (ii).

Wait, but in reality, LDA is a strong base that needs to be handled in a specific solvent, often THF or DME. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate with LDA in DME.

2. Then, add ethyl iodide.

3. Then, acid workup.

So, in terms of the sequence, the reagents would be LDA and DME (step i), then CH3CH2I (step ii), then H3O+ (step iii), as in option C.

But option D has all steps except LDA in step i and the rest in step ii. Hmm.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base that's usually used in a solvent like THF or DME. So, step i would be adding LDA in DME. Then, step ii would be adding the alkylating agent (CH3CH2I) and any other reagents. Then step iii is H3O+.

So, option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. So, product B is heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, option D's reagents are (i) LDA, (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. But that seems to suggest that DME is added in step ii, which might not make sense because DME is the solvent. So perhaps step i is LDA in DME, then step ii is adding ethyl iodide, step iii is H3O+.

So, option C's sequence would make more sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says B is heptan-4-one, and option D also says B is heptan-4-one. So, product-wise, either C or D could be correct. But the reagents differ.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine. So, when you deprotonate it with LDA, which is a strong, bulky base, you're generating a carbanion adjacent to the double bond. Then, alkylation (with ethyl iodide) would add an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine. Since the original enamine was derived from pentan-2-one, adding an ethyl group would give a longer chain ketone.

Wait, but let me think of the overall process. The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. When you treat this enamine with LDA, you deprotonate it, making it more nucleophilic. Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate the deprotonated site. Then, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to form a new ketone and the amine.

So, the new ketone would have more carbons than the starting ketone.

Pentan-2-one is five carbons. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) would make it seven, hence heptan-4-one.

So, product is heptan-4-one and the amine, which would be N,N-dimethylethanamine, I think.

Wait, but in the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one. So, the product B would be heptan-4-one and the amine.

But looking at the options:

Option C: B is heptan-4-one.

No, wait, looking again. The options state:

Option C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, but the product is just the ketone? Or is the amine also a product? Because in enamine hydrolysis, you get both the ketone and the amine.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A) B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Option C) B = heptan-4-one.

So, perhaps in this case, only the ketone is listed as product B? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says, "Mention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A)."

So, B is the product, which would be the ketone. Or perhaps it's a mixture of products, but in the options, it's listed as a single product.

Wait, perhaps in this reaction, the amine is a byproduct and the main product is the ketone.

Hmm, but the question presents the product as a single compound, so perhaps only the ketone is considered as product B.

In that case, the product is heptan-4-one.

So, moving back to the reagents. The steps would be deprotonate with LDA in DME, then add ethyl iodide, then acid workup.

So, the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Which corresponds to option C: Reagent A is a three-step process, and product B is heptan-4-one.

But looking at the options, option C is:

C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Option D is:

D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, option D's steps are done in two steps. Step i is LDA, step ii is DME, then CH3CH2I, H3O+. That seems a bit odd because DME is a solvent, so it's part of the reaction conditions, not a reagent to add stepwise.

So, option C's sequence makes more sense: step i is LDA and DME (so they're used together), step ii is CH3CH2I, step iii is H3O+.

Hence, option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the alternative: What if the enamine isn't being alkylated but is instead undergoing some other reaction? For example, maybe it's a conjugate addition. But I think the presence of ethyl iodide suggests alkylation.

Another point: LDA is a strong base, but it's also a good deprotonating agent. So, the first step is deprotonating the enamine to generate a carbanion. Then, the second step is alkylation, adding the ethyl group. Then, the acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to form the ketone.

So, with that, the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are as in option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to form a product B. The analysis of the options and reaction steps is as follows:

1. **Understanding the Starting Material**: The starting material is an enamine derived from a secondary amine (likely N,N-dimethylethanamine) and a ketone (likely pentan-2-one). The enamine structure can be represented as CH₂=C(CH₂CH₂CH₃)-NMe₂⁺.

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step (i)**: LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) is used to deprotonate the enamine, generating a nucleophilic carbanion adjacent to the double bond.
   - **Step (ii)**: CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide) acts as an alkylating agent, adding an ethyl group to the deprotonated enamine.
   - **Step (iii)**: H₃O⁺ (acidic workup) hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C-N bond and forming a ketone.

3. **Product Analysis**: The hydrolysis of the enamine results in a ketone. The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, and the addition of an ethyl group via alkylation extends the carbon chain. This leads to the formation of heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon ketone with the ketone group at position 4).

4. **Reagent Sequence**:
   - Option C specifies the reagents as (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺. This sequence aligns with the reaction steps: deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.
   - Option D incorrectly groups DME with the other reagents in step (ii), which is inconsistent with the typical use of DME as a solvent.

5. **Conclusion**: The correct sequence of reagents is provided in option C, and the product B is heptan-4-one.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds, right? They're useful for certain types of reactions, like maybe some kind of conjugate additions or maybe in forming rings.

The question gives me a starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down.

Pentan-2-ylidene would be a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the second carbon, so it's CH2-CH2-CH-CH2-CH3, but wait, the position might be different.

Hmm, not sure, but maybe it's something like that.

The reaction is with reagent A, and it forms product B. The options are about what B is and what the sequence of reagents is.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. B is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The ethanaminium part is CH3NH2+ with a methyl group attached. The pentan-2-ylidene group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, wait. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 with a double bond. Maybe it's (CH2)2-CH-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be penten-1-ylidene or something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as (E)- configuration. So, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. So the starting material has a structure where an ethanaminium group (CH2NHMe+) is attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a double bond in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+? Not sure, but maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. But perhaps that's getting off track.

So, the reaction is adding reagent A to this enamine. Let me think about the reagents in the options.

Option C: Reagents are LDA and DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one. Hmm, heptan-4-one is a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

Option D: Reagents are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, so options C and D have the same product, but different reagent sequences.

Wait, but what's the starting material? Let's think: the starting material is an enamine, which is derived from a secondary amine. When you react an enamine with an electrophile, the enamine acts as a nucleophile. But in some cases, you might deprotonate the enamine to make it a stronger base, then alkylate it.

Then, after alkylation, acid workup would protonate, and perhaps hydrolysis would occur to give a ketone or something else.

Wait, but the product in options A and B is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine. So maybe that's the result of hydrolysis of an enamine.

Wait, in the enamine reaction, when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get back the original carbonyl compound and the amine. So if the enamine is R2N-CH2-CR2, upon hydrolysis, you might get R2N-R plus a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, in this case, the starting material is an enamine (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So when you hydrolyze it, perhaps you get a ketone and an amine.

But the product in options A and B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no, pentan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-3-one. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The position of the ketone in pentan-2-one is on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, it's (CH2CH2CH2)COCH3? No, wait. No, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CHCOCH2CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me count: pentan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, pentan-2-one would have the ketone group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, CH2(CO) is the second carbon. Wait, wait, pentan-2-one: the five-carbon chain with the ketone on C2. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So, that's correct.

Wait, but if the starting enamine is hydrolyzed, would that give pentan-2-one and a secondary amine?

Let's think: Enamine formation is usually from a secondary amine and a ketone. The enamine is R2N-CH2-CH(R')-R''. Then, when you hydrolyze it, you get back the ketone R2C=O and the amine R''NH2.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is the enamine already. So perhaps when you add acid, it will hydrolyze back to the original components.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So, the enamine must have been formed from a ketone and a secondary amine.

Wait, let me think: the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure would be something like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3) as a substituent on a double bond, connected to an NMe2+ group.

Wait, maybe the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. For instance, if you have a secondary amine like N,N-dimethylethanamine (CH3)2NH and a carbonyl, say, pentan-2-one, the enamine would form.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction steps.

The reaction as per the question is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A → B.

So, what's happening here? The starting material is an enamine. When you treat an enamine with certain reagents, you can perform various reactions. One possibility is the Michael addition, but that's when the enamine attacks an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is undergoing alkylation.

Wait, another approach: in the presence of a strong base like LDA, the enamine can be deprotonated. Then, an alkylating agent like ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) can add, leading to an alkylation of the enamine. Then, upon hydrolysis with acid (H3O+), you might get a new ketone.

Let's think about each step:

1. Using LDA (a strong base) to deprotonate the enamine. Enamines are typically less acidic than amines but more acidic than alkanes. LDA is a strong enough base to deprotonate them.

2. Then, adding ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), which would alkylate the deprotonated enamine. So, the enamine's nitrogen (or the adjacent carbon) would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to an alkylation.

3. Then, acid workup (H3O+) would protonate and possibly hydrolyze the enamine, leading to a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the enamine is CH2=C-(R)-NMe2+, after deprotonation and alkylation, perhaps the ethyl group adds to the nitrogen, making it CH2=C-(R)-NMe2Et+. Then, upon hydrolysis, this would split into a ketone and the amine.

Alternatively, maybe the alkylation is on the carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is:

CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+.

So, when you deprotonate that with LDA, you get a carbanion adjacent to the double bond. Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate the carbon, adding an ethyl group. So, the structure becomes CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-Et-NMe2+.

Wait, perhaps. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and the amine.

Wait, but how would that work? Enamine hydrolysis typically requires acid. So, after adding ethyl iodide, when you do H3O+, the enamine would hydrolyze to form a ketone and the corresponding amine.

But wait, the initial enamine is (E)-configured. So, after alkylation, maybe the structure becomes longer. Let's think about the product.

If the starting enamine is derived from a ketone and a secondary amine, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would increase the chain length. Then hydrolysis would give a larger ketone.

In the options, option C and D have product B as heptan-4-one. So, a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

How would that happen? Let's think. The starting material's enamine is perhaps derived from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine. So, when you alkylate it, you add an ethyl group, making the chain longer.

Wait, let me outline:

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Reaction steps:

1. Deprotonate with LDA → enamine becomes more nucleophilic.

2. Alkylation with CH3CH2I → adds an ethyl group.

3. Acid workup → hydrolysis to a ketone and amine.

So, the hydrolysis would give a new ketone. The original ketone was pentan-2-one (five carbons). Adding an ethyl group via alkylation would increase the chain length.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+ which is derived from a five-carbon ketone (like pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine.

When you alkylate that, say, add an ethyl group to the nitrogen? Or to the carbon chain? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine has a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a double bond, and after alkylation, the carbon chain extends.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is part of a conjugated system. So, after alkylation, you get a longer chain, and upon hydrolysis, you'd get a ketone that's longer.

So, starting material: pentan-2-one (five carbons) and dimethylamine. Enamine is (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+. Then, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would make the chain longer, leading to a heptan-4-one after hydrolysis.

Because the original ketone was five carbons, and adding two more (ethyl is two carbons?), but wait, ethyl is CH2CH3. So, perhaps the ketone becomes seven carbons.

Wait, let's count. Suppose the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. The enamine would have the structure CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+.

When you alkylate, adding an ethyl group, perhaps to the nitrogen, making it NMe2CH2CH2+.

Wait, but how does that translate into the ketone after hydrolysis? Maybe when you hydrolyze, the nitrogen is released as the amine, and the carbonyl is formed from the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds to the carbon chain.

For example, the enamine is CH2=C-(CH2CH2CH3)-NMe2+. Alkylating the carbon adjacent to the double bond (the carbanion from LDA deprotonation) with ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group there, making the structure CH2=C-CH2CH2CH3-CH2CH2-NMe2+. Then, upon hydrolysis, the nitrogen is split off, giving a ketone.

Wait, but how? Hydrolysis of the enamine would typically break the C-N bond, leading to a carbonyl group. So, the R group attached to the double bond would become the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of the enamine as R2C=CR-NR2. Hydrolysis would produce R2C=O and NR2R.

Wait, but maybe in this case, after alkylation, you have a longer chain.

So, the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. So, the enamine structure is (CH2CH2CH3)C=CH-NMe2+ or something like that.

After alkylation, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the central carbon, making it longer.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the product options.

Options C and D have product B as heptan-4-one, which is a seven-carbon ketone with the ketone group on carbon 4: CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, wait, no. Heptan-4-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So, that's seven carbons in total, with the ketone on C4.

So, how does that form?

The starting enamine is made from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine. Then, perhaps the alkylation adds two more carbons (from ethyl iodide, but ethyl is two carbons) but that may not add two carbons. Wait, ethyl iodide is CH3CH2I. So, adding an ethyl group would add two carbons.

Wait, let me think: starting with a five-carbon enamine, adding two carbons via alkylation would make a seven-carbon compound. Then, hydrolysis would give a seven-carbon ketone.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one, which matches options C and D.

So, the steps would be: deprotonate the enamine with LDA, then alkylate with ethyl iodide, then acid workup to hydrolyze.

But looking at the options:

Option C: Reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the difference between C and D is the order of steps. Option C's reagent A is three steps: LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Option D's reagent A is LDA, followed by DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ all in step (ii).

Wait, but in reality, LDA is a strong base that needs to be handled in a specific solvent, often THF or DME. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate with LDA in DME.

2. Then, add ethyl iodide.

3. Then, acid workup.

So, in terms of the sequence, the reagents would be LDA and DME (step i), then CH3CH2I (step ii), then H3O+ (step iii), as in option C.

But option D has all steps except LDA in step i and the rest in step ii. Hmm.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base that's usually used in a solvent like THF or DME. So, step i would be adding LDA in DME. Then, step ii would be adding the alkylating agent (CH3CH2I) and any other reagents. Then step iii is H3O+.

So, option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. So, product B is heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, option D's reagents are (i) LDA, (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. But that seems to suggest that DME is added in step ii, which might not make sense because DME is the solvent. So perhaps step i is LDA in DME, then step ii is adding ethyl iodide, step iii is H3O+.

So, option C's sequence would make more sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says B is heptan-4-one, and option D also says B is heptan-4-one. So, product-wise, either C or D could be correct. But the reagents differ.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine. So, when you deprotonate it with LDA, which is a strong, bulky base, you're generating a carbanion adjacent to the double bond. Then, alkylation (with ethyl iodide) would add an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine. Since the original enamine was derived from pentan-2-one, adding an ethyl group would give a longer chain ketone.

Wait, but let me think of the overall process. The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. When you treat this enamine with LDA, you deprotonate it, making it more nucleophilic. Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate the deprotonated site. Then, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to form a new ketone and the amine.

So, the new ketone would have more carbons than the starting ketone.

Pentan-2-one is five carbons. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) would make it seven, hence heptan-4-one.

So, product is heptan-4-one and the amine, which would be N,N-dimethylethanamine, I think.

Wait, but in the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one. So, the product B would be heptan-4-one and the amine.

But looking at the options:

Option C: B is heptan-4-one.

No, wait, looking again. The options state:

Option C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, but the product is just the ketone? Or is the amine also a product? Because in enamine hydrolysis, you get both the ketone and the amine.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A) B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Option C) B = heptan-4-one.

So, perhaps in this case, only the ketone is listed as product B? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says, "Mention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A)."

So, B is the product, which would be the ketone. Or perhaps it's a mixture of products, but in the options, it's listed as a single product.

Wait, perhaps in this reaction, the amine is a byproduct and the main product is the ketone.

Hmm, but the question presents the product as a single compound, so perhaps only the ketone is considered as product B.

In that case, the product is heptan-4-one.

So, moving back to the reagents. The steps would be deprotonate with LDA in DME, then add ethyl iodide, then acid workup.

So, the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Which corresponds to option C: Reagent A is a three-step process, and product B is heptan-4-one.

But looking at the options, option C is:

C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Option D is:

D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, option D's steps are done in two steps. Step i is LDA, step ii is DME, then CH3CH2I, H3O+. That seems a bit odd because DME is a solvent, so it's part of the reaction conditions, not a reagent to add stepwise.

So, option C's sequence makes more sense: step i is LDA and DME (so they're used together), step ii is CH3CH2I, step iii is H3O+.

Hence, option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the alternative: What if the enamine isn't being alkylated but is instead undergoing some other reaction? For example, maybe it's a conjugate addition. But I think the presence of ethyl iodide suggests alkylation.

Another point: LDA is a strong base, but it's also a good deprotonating agent. So, the first step is deprotonating the enamine to generate a carbanion. Then, the second step is alkylation, adding the ethyl group. Then, the acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to form the ketone.

So, with that, the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are as in option C.


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to form a product B. The analysis of the options and reaction steps is as follows:

1. **Understanding the Starting Material**: The starting material is an enamine derived from a secondary amine (likely N,N-dimethylethanamine) and a ketone (likely pentan-2-one). The enamine structure can be represented as CH₂=C(CH₂CH₂CH₃)-NMe₂⁺.

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step (i)**: LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) is used to deprotonate the enamine, generating a nucleophilic carbanion adjacent to the double bond.
   - **Step (ii)**: CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide) acts as an alkylating agent, adding an ethyl group to the deprotonated enamine.
   - **Step (iii)**: H₃O⁺ (acidic workup) hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C-N bond and forming a ketone.

3. **Product Analysis**: The hydrolysis of the enamine results in a ketone. The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, and the addition of an ethyl group via alkylation extends the carbon chain. This leads to the formation of heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon ketone with the ketone group at position 4).

4. **Reagent Sequence**:
   - Option C specifies the reagents as (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺. This sequence aligns with the reaction steps: deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.
   - Option D incorrectly groups DME with the other reagents in step (ii), which is inconsistent with the typical use of DME as a solvent.

5. **Conclusion**: The correct sequence of reagents is provided in option C, and the product B is heptan-4-one.

Answer: C
