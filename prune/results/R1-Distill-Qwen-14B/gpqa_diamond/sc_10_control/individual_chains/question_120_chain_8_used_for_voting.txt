Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about what it's asking. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same everywhere. And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if plx is p, then distance d is 1/p parsecs.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, like, how many stars are there for each little change in p. I think this relates to the distribution of stars in space.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's say the number density is n (number per cubic parsec). So in a small volume, the number of stars would be n times that volume.

But how does volume relate to parallax? Parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/p. So for a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. Wait, but when considering a range of parallax, we're looking at a thin shell at a certain distance.

Let me think about a thin shell between p and p + dp. The distance for that shell is d = 1/p, but wait, no, because p is 1/d, so dp is the change in parallax. Hmm, maybe I should express volume in terms of p.

Wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. But when considering a change in p, dp is positive, so the thickness in terms of d is negative because as p increases, d decreases. But since we're talking about volume, which is positive, maybe I should take the absolute value. So the volume element would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, let me double-check that.

Wait, d = 1/p. So dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the thickness in distance is |dd| = (1/p²) dp. So the volume of the shell is 4πd² * |dd|. Substituting d=1/p, this becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The formula for the volume of a spherical shell would be surface area times thickness. Surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is |dd|. So 4πd² dd.

Since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So |dd| is (1/p²) dp. So substitute into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell would be n * volume, which is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so number per unit p. So the number per unit p is (n * 4π (1/p^4)) ), because dp is the unit range. So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's N(p) = number of stars in a thin shell at distance d=1/p, per unit p. So from earlier, N(p) = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So per unit p, it's proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would be 1/p^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the density. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density n is constant. So in a volume V, the number is n*V. Now, for a given p, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/(p^2)) dp? Wait, no, earlier steps showed that the volume element is 4π d² dd, which with d=1/p becomes 4π (1/p²) (1/p² dp) ), so 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is (n *4π) * (1/p^4) ) because dp is the unit range.

So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: considering the distribution of stars in 3D space. The number per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. So the number per unit distance is n * 4π d².

But parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting d into the expression, number per unit d is n *4π (1/p)^2. But in terms of number per unit p, since d = 1/p, a change in p (dp) is related to change in d (dd = -1/p² dp). So the number per unit p is n *4π (1/p)^2 (1/p²) ), which is n *4π (1/p^4). So again, 1/p^4.

So yeah, the answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we consider the following:

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). A thin shell of stars at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) has a volume of \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

2. **Volume in Terms of Parallax**: Substituting \( d = 1/p \), the thickness in parallax \( dp \) relates to \( dd \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The volume of the thin shell becomes:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 |dd| = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
   \]

3. **Number of Stars in the Shell**: Assuming a uniform number density \( n \) (stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars in the shell is:
   \[
   N = n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
   \]

4. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Dividing by \( dp \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{N}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
   \]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/p^4 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **A**.

Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about what it's asking. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same everywhere.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if plx is p, then distance d is 1/p parsecs.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, like, how many stars are there for each little change in p. I think this relates to the distribution of stars in space.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's say the number density is n (number per cubic parsec). So in a small volume, the number of stars would be n times that volume.

But how does volume relate to parallax? Parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/p. So for a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. Wait, but when considering a range of parallax, we're looking at a thin shell at a certain distance.

Let me think about a thin shell between p and p + dp. The distance for that shell is d = 1/p, but wait, no, because p is 1/d, so dp is the change in parallax. Hmm, maybe I should express volume in terms of p.

Wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. But when considering a change in p, dp is positive, so the thickness in terms of d is negative because as p increases, d decreases. But since we're talking about volume, which is positive, maybe I should take the absolute value. So the volume element would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, let me double-check that.

Wait, d = 1/p. So dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the thickness in distance is |dd| = (1/p²) dp. So the volume of the shell is 4πd² * |dd|. Substituting d=1/p, this becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The formula for the volume of a spherical shell would be surface area times thickness. Surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is |dd|. So 4πd² dd.

Since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So |dd| is (1/p²) dp. So substitute into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell would be n * volume, which is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so number per unit p. So the number per unit p is (n * 4π (1/p^4)) ), because dp is the unit range. So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's N(p) = number of stars in a thin shell at distance d=1/p, per unit p. So from earlier, N(p) = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So per unit p, it's proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would be 1/p^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the density. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density n is constant. So in a volume V, the number is n*V. Now, for a given p, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/(p^2)) dp? Wait, no, earlier steps showed that the volume element is 4π d² dd, which with d=1/p becomes 4π (1/p²) (1/p² dp) ), so 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is (n *4π) * (1/p^4) ) because dp is the unit range.

So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: considering the distribution of stars in 3D space. The number per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. So the number per unit distance is n * 4π d².

But parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting d into the expression, number per unit d is n *4π (1/p)^2. But in terms of number per unit p, since d = 1/p, a change in p (dp) is related to change in d (dd = -1/p² dp). So the number per unit p is n *4π (1/p)^2 (1/p²) ), which is n *4π (1/p^4). So again, 1/p^4.

So yeah, the answer should be A.
