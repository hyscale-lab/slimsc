Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D, with various percentages.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to understand what the stability constants mean. Stability constants (formation constants) represent how stable a complex is. A higher β value means the complex is more stable because it requires more ligand to form the complex.

The cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(II), where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4. The stability constants given are in order β1, β2, β3, β4, so each corresponds to n=1, n=2, etc. Wait, but wait, sometimes β is given as the constant for the overall formation, but sometimes it's for each additional ligand. I think in this context, each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2-, and so on.

The blue color is associated with the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, so that's the n=2 complex. So the question is asking for the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^(2+) among all possible Co species.

So all the Co species include the free Co^2+ ion, and the complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ligands. So we have to calculate the concentration of each species and then find the fraction that is the n=2 complex.

The approach I think is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the formula that involves the log of the stability constant and the concentrations. Alternatively, we can model the distribution using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general idea is that the distribution of metal complexes depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration. The fraction of each species can be found using the formula for each complex, considering their formation from the previous species.

Alternatively, the fractions can be determined by considering the relative thermodynamic stability, which is influenced by the β values and the concentrations of the ligands.

Let me recall the method. The fraction of each complex can be found by dividing each species' concentration by the sum of all species. The concentration of each species is proportional to β terms multiplied by the product of ligand concentrations.

Wait, more accurately, the fraction f_n for the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_k [SCN^-]^k) ) for k = 0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, the free ion is when n=0. So when n=0, the term is β0 [SCN^-]^0, which is 1*1=1. But wait, in this case, the β values given are for n=1, 2, 3, 4. So probably, β0 is taken as 1, as the free ion. So the sum in the denominator includes all terms from k=0 to k=4.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each βk is the stability constant for the complex with k SCN- ligands.

So for each species, the concentration is proportional to βk [SCN^-]^k.

But wait, let's think about the formation of each complex starting from Co^2+.

The formation would be stepwise, but when calculating the distribution, it's often done using the overall stability constants. So each complex's concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, that's not exactly correct because each β is the overall constant, so:

The concentration of the complex with n ligands is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} + [Co(SCN)_3}^{-} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{0})

Wait, but since all Co species are summed, the denominator is the total concentration of all species.

Alternatively, considering that the total [Co] is the sum of all species, which is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But in terms of the fractions, each species's contribution is based on their respective β values and the ligand concentration.

So, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (Σ_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, for each n, the [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co][SCN]^n. So the total [Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_k] for k=0 to 4.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the fractions in terms of the ligand concentration and the β values.

Let me see. The fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of all complexes.

So, f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / Σ [Co(SCN)_k] for k=0 to 4.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n. So,

f_n = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n) / Σ (β_k [Co][SCN]^k )

The [Co] in numerator and denominator cancels out, so:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (Σ β_k [SCN]^k )

So for each n, compute β_n * [SCN]^n, then sum all these terms, and the fraction for n=2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / sum.

So, let me compute each term:

n=0: [SCN]^0 is 1, so term is β0 * 1 = 1*1 =1.

Wait, but the given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So what about β0? Since β0 is the stability constant for the free ion, which is 1, since it's not a complex. So yes, β0=1.

So the terms are:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 *1=1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1, so 9 * (0.1)^1 = 0.9.

n=2: 40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4:16 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Wait, let me do the calculations again:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0=1.

n=1:9 * (0.1) =0.9.

n=2:40 * (0.01)=0.4.

n=3:63 * (0.001)=0.063.

n=4:16 * (0.0001)=0.0016.

Now, sum all these terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; plus 0.4=2.3; plus 0.063=2.363; plus 0.0016=2.3646.

So the sum is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%. But wait, looking at the options, D is 16.9%, which would be that.

But wait, wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-) complex. So that's n=2, which would be 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options include 42.3% (A), 25.6% (B), 38.1% (C), and 16.9% (D). So option D is 16.9%, which matches.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and [Co] is 0.01 M. But in the calculation above, I treated [Co] as 1, but in reality, [Co] might affect the fraction because each term is βn [SCN]^n, but [Co] is canceled out. So the fractions are independent of [Co], because in the numerator and denominator, [Co] is present and cancels.

Wait, wait, in the equation I derived earlier, f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / sum(βk [SCN]^k ) ), [Co] cancels. So the fractions only depend on the βn and [SCN] concentrations, not on the initial [Co] concentration. So the initial [Co] doesn't affect the fraction.

So the method is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's recompute the sum.

n=0: 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9 → sum so far 1.9.

n=2:40 * 0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

n=3:63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

n=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So the sum is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646.

Calculating 0.4 / 2.3646: let's do this more accurately.

2.3646 → let's compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169 = ?

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169:

2 * 0.169 = 0.338.

0.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.3646 *0.17 ≈ 0.06198.

Total approximately 0.338 +0.062 ≈ 0.400.

Yes, so 2.3646 *0.169 ≈0.400. So 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the answer is D, 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN^- ions. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, corresponding to the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^0, respectively. The free ion Co²⁺ corresponds to β₀ = 1.

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, the ligand concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The contributions of each species are calculated as follows:

- For **n = 0** (free Co²⁺):  
  \[
  \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
  \]

- For **n = 1** ([CoSCN]^+):  
  \[
  \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
  \]

- For **n = 2** ([Co(SCN)_2]^(2-)):  
  \[
  \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
  \]

- For **n = 3** ([Co(SCN)_3]^−):  
  \[
  \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
  \]

- For **n = 4** ([Co(SCN)_4]^0):  
  \[
  \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
  \]

The total sum of all contributions is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-) complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Let me recall the method. The fraction of each complex can be found by dividing each species' concentration by the sum of all species. The concentration of each species is proportional to β terms multiplied by the product of ligand concentrations.

Wait, more accurately, the fraction f_n for the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_k [SCN^-]^k) ) for k = 0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, the free ion is when n=0. So when n=0, the term is β0 [SCN^-]^0, which is 1*1=1. But wait, in this case, the β values given are for n=1, 2, 3, 4. So probably, β0 is taken as 1, as the free ion. So the sum in the denominator includes all terms from k=0 to k=4.

The formation would be stepwise, but when calculating the distribution, it's often done using the overall stability constants. So each complex's concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, that's not exactly correct because each β is the overall constant, so:

The concentration of the complex with n ligands is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} + [Co(SCN)_3}^{-} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{0})

Wait, but since all Co species are summed, the denominator is the total concentration of all species.

Alternatively, considering that the total [Co] is the sum of all species, which is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But in terms of the fractions, each species's contribution is based on their respective β values and the ligand concentration.

So, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (Σ_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, for each n, the [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co][SCN]^n. So the total [Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_k] for k=0 to 4.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the fractions in terms of the ligand concentration and the β values.

Let me see. The fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of all complexes.

So, f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / Σ [Co(SCN)_k] for k=0 to 4.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n. So,

f_n = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n) / Σ (β_k [Co][SCN]^k )

The [Co] in numerator and denominator cancels out, so:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (Σ β_k [SCN]^k )

So for each n, compute β_n * [SCN]^n, then sum all these terms, and the fraction for n=2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / sum.

So, let me compute each term:

n=0: [SCN]^0 is 1, so term is β0 * 1 = 1*1 =1.

Wait, but the given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So what about β0? Since β0 is the stability constant for the free ion, which is 1, since it's not a complex. So yes, β0=1.

So the terms are:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 *1=1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1, so 9 * (0.1)^1 = 0.9.

n=2: 40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4:16 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Wait, let me do the calculations again:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0=1.

n=1:9 * (0.1) =0.9.

n=2:40 * (0.01)=0.4.

n=3:63 * (0.001)=0.063.

n=4:16 * (0.0001)=0.0016.

Now, sum all these terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; plus 0.4=2.3; plus 0.063=2.363; plus 0.0016=2.3646.

So the sum is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%. But wait, looking at the options, D is 16.9%, which would be that.

But wait, wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-) complex. So that's n=2, which would be 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options include 42.3% (A), 25.6% (B), 38.1% (C), and 16.9% (D). So option D is 16.9%, which matches.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and [Co] is 0.01 M. But in the calculation above, I treated [Co] as 1, but in reality, [Co] might affect the fraction because each term is βn [SCN]^n, but [Co] is canceled out. So the fractions are independent of [Co], because in the numerator and denominator, [Co] is present and cancels.

Wait, wait, in the equation I derived earlier, f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / sum(βk [SCN]^k ) ), [Co] cancels. So the fractions only depend on the βn and [SCN] concentrations, not on the initial [Co] concentration. So the initial [Co] doesn't affect the fraction.

So the method is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's recompute the sum.

n=0: 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9 → sum so far 1.9.

n=2:40 * 0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

n=3:63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

n=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So the sum is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646.

Calculating 0.4 / 2.3646: let's do this more accurately.

2.3646 → let's compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169 = ?

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169:

2 * 0.169 = 0.338.

0.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.3646 *0.17 ≈ 0.06198.

Total approximately 0.338 +0.062 ≈ 0.400.

Yes, so 2.3646 *0.169 ≈0.400. So 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the answer is D, 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN^- ions. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, corresponding to the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^0, respectively. The free ion Co²⁺ corresponds to β₀ = 1.

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, the ligand concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The contributions of each species are calculated as follows:

- For **n = 0** (free Co²⁺):  
  \[
  \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
  \]

- For **n = 1** ([CoSCN]^+):  
  \[
  \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
  \]

- For **n = 2** ([Co(SCN)_2]^(2-)):  
  \[
  \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
  \]

- For **n = 3** ([Co(SCN)_3]^−):  
  \[
  \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
  \]

- For **n = 4** ([Co(SCN)_4]^0):  
  \[
  \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
  \]

The total sum of all contributions is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-) complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
