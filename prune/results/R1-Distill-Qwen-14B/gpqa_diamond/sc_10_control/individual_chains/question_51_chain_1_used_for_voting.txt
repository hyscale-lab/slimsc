Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given as A to D, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But since it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons. Oh right, a grounded conductor will have its potential at zero. Wait, no, actually, the ground is at zero potential, so the conductor's potential is the same as the ground.

So the conducting sphere must be at zero potential. Now, when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges will adjust to maintain the potential at zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? Potential energy in a system of charges... Hmm. I remember that the potential energy of a charge in the presence of another charge configuration is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to its position. But here, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges on it are induced.

I think the conducting sphere, when grounded, will have an induced charge opposite to q. Because when you bring a positive charge near a conductor, electrons in the conductor (since it's grounded) will move to the near side, leaving the far side positive. Or wait, no, wait—conductor being neutral, when a positive charge is brought near, the conductor's electrons move toward the charge, leaving the far side positive. But since it's grounded, those excess charges can leave the sphere. So the sphere ends up with a charge opposite to q, but wait, no—wait, the sphere would have an induced charge opposite to q, but since it's grounded, the excess charge can leave. So the sphere's net charge would be...?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the system. The charge q is outside the sphere. The sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges will be on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential must be zero.

I think the potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere's center. But the presence of the sphere affects the potential that the charge q experiences.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the sphere as a point charge at its center, because for points outside a conducting sphere, the potential behaves as if all the charge were at the center. But wait, that's for the potential due to the sphere itself. But in this case, the sphere is grounded, so its charge is adjusted to keep its potential at zero. Wait, but how?

Wait, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges will cause an effective potential at the location of q. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential due to the sphere at the point where q is placed... Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: The potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. So, if we have the charge q and the sphere. The sphere is grounded, so when we bring q near it, the sphere's induced charges will adjust, but the sphere as a whole doesn't contribute any potential energy since its potential is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is just the self-energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another way: The conducting sphere can be considered as having a charge Q. But since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. The potential at a distance d from the center (where charge q is placed) due to the sphere is that of a point charge Q at the center. So the potential at that point is V = kQ/d.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential due to the sphere at its own surface is zero, which gives V = 0 at r=R. So, the potential at a distance d from the center (d > R) is V = kQ/(d). But the sphere's potential is zero at its surface, so substituting r=R gives V = kQ/R = 0 → Q must be zero? That can't be right, because when you bring a charge near, the sphere's induced charges are non-zero.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The sphere is conducting, so the induced charges are such that the potential is zero at the surface. So, if I have a charge q outside, the sphere's potential is due to both q and its own induced charges. But the sphere's potential must be zero everywhere on it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the sphere as having a charge Q, but the system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to d, considering the potential created by the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at infinity is the same as on the sphere.

Wait, no, the ground is at zero potential. So the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential due to the charge q at any point in space is V_q = kq/(r'), where r' is the distance from q to that point. But the sphere is a conductor, so the potential is the same across its surface, which is zero.

So, perhaps the potential at the center of the sphere is the same as the surface. Wait, no, the potential inside a conductor is the same as on the surface. So the potential at the center is zero as well.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of image charges. There's a method where a grounded sphere can be modeled using an image charge.

Wait, I remember that for a point charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere can be treated as having an image charge. The image charge method is used to find the induced charges.

In the case of a grounded sphere, the image charge would be inside the sphere. Let me recall the formula. The image charge q' is given by q' = -q (R/d'), where d' is the distance from the charge q to the center, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps the image charge approach isn't the right way here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere is the potential created by the sphere's induced charges. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential at the point where q is located, which is d away from the center (so outside the sphere, since d > R), is due to the charge q and the sphere's charge.

Wait, no. The sphere's charge is induced by q. The potential at the location of q would be due to the sphere's induced charge. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which affects the potential elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the mutual potential energy between q and the induced charges on the sphere. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The system's potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges. So, initially, both the charge q and the conducting sphere are neutral. Then, when we bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, the sphere will have induced charges. But since it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere remains zero. Wait, wait—if the sphere is conducting and neutral, and I bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges will be +Q and -Q, but since it's grounded, the -Q can flow away, leaving the sphere with a charge of +Q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If I bring a positive charge q near a neutral conducting sphere that's grounded, the electrons in the sphere (which is neutral, so equal + and - charges) will be attracted to the near side of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the excess negative charge can leave the sphere, leaving the sphere with a positive charge. So the sphere would have a positive charge Q.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can flow to or from the ground. So, considering that, when I bring a positive charge q near, electrons from the sphere will move to the ground, leaving the sphere with a positive charge Q. The induced charge on the sphere would be Q, equal in magnitude to q? Or is it something else.

Wait, I think the induced charge on the sphere will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential due to the charge q and the sphere's own charge Q must sum to zero at the sphere's surface.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = kq/(R + d'), where d' is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. Wait, but charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the distance from q to the surface is d - R, assuming d > R.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is kq/(d - R + R) = kq/(d). Wait, no, wait. The distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface would vary depending on where on the sphere that point is. But for a conductor, the potential is uniform across the surface. So we can model the potential at the sphere's surface as the potential due to charge q and the sphere's own charge Q.

Wait, but the sphere's charge Q would produce a potential of kQ/R at its surface. The potential due to q at the sphere's surface is kq/(d'), where d' is the distance from q to the point on the sphere.

But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on it. The sphere is grounded, so the potential on it is zero. Therefore, the sum of the potentials due to q and Q at the sphere's surface must be zero.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is due to both the external charge q and its own charge Q. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to q. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so the potential is the same everywhere on it. So, the potential at any point on the sphere is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to Q.

But since the sphere is grounded, that potential is zero. So,

k Q / R + k q / R' = 0,

where R' is the distance from q to a point on the sphere.

Wait, but the distance from q to the sphere's surface is not uniform; it depends on where on the sphere. Oh, but for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is uniform across the sphere's surface?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the method of images. For a conducting sphere, when a charge is placed outside, the induced charges can be modeled using an image charge inside the sphere.

In the method of images, the image charge q' is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, on the same line as q and the sphere's center. The image charge q' is negative if the sphere is conducting and neutral. So the induced charge on the sphere is 2 q' R^2/(d - R) or something like that? Wait, perhaps I should think of the image charge as being inside the sphere.

Alternatively, I remember that for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' of a charge q at distance d (d > R) from the center is given by q' = -(R^2 / d) q. So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance of R^2/d from the center towards q.

So, the total charge induced on the sphere would be Q = q' + q'' (but I'm not sure about that). Wait, no. The image charge method tells us that the induced charge on the sphere is equal to the image charge. Or is it that the image charge represents the induced charges?

Wait, the image charge method is used to find the potential outside the sphere. So, the potential outside is as if there were a charge q at distance d and an image charge q' at distance d' inside. The sum of the potentials from these two would give the same result as the potential due to the actual induced charges.

But in any case, the presence of the sphere causes the potential at the location of q to change.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q into the vicinity of the sphere, which would be the potential at that point multiplied by q.

But the potential at q's location is due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, the sphere's induced charge is Q. So, the potential at q's location (distance d from the center) due to Q is V = k Q / d.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, which would give us a relation between Q and q.

Wait, let me think again. The potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential due to Q at the surface is kQ/R. The potential due to q at the surface is kq/(d), since q is at distance d from the center, so the average distance from q to the surface is d - R? Or is it the other way? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is k q / (d), because the distance from q to the center is d, so the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface is d (since the sphere is at the center). Wait, no, that's only if the point is directly towards or away from q. But for other points, it's different. But the average would depend on the solid angle. Alternatively, for the purpose of potential calculation, the potential due to an external charge q at a point on the sphere's surface is k q / (distance from q to that point). But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. So, the potential at the surface due to q and the sphere's charge must add up to zero.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the system's potential energy. The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away, which is in the field of the sphere's induced charges.

The potential at d due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d. So, the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q / d).

But I need to find Q in terms of q and d. How?

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential on the surface is due to both q and Q.

So, V_surface = V_q + V_Q = 0.

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q. The distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface is variable, but since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere. So, for a conducting sphere, the potential due to an external charge q can be considered as if the charge were at the center. Wait, that makes sense because inside a conductor, the charges rearrange such that the electric field is zero, so the potential is the same throughout.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / R, because for a sphere, the potential outside at distance R is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So, the distance would be R.

Wait, but wait, no. The charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the potential due to q at the sphere's surface is not k q / R. It would be k q / r, where r is the distance from q to the point on the sphere. But for a point on the sphere, that distance varies. Hmm, but because of the spherical symmetry, the average potential due to an external charge would be the same as if the charge were at the center. So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / d, because the distance from q to the center is d, and for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is the same as if it were at the center. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the image charge method is easier. The image charge q' is located inside the sphere, at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R^2 / d.

The image charge is q' = - ( R^2 q ) / d.

So, the sphere's induced charge is equal to the image charge q', so Q = q' = - R² q / d.

But wait, isn't the image charge just a model? Because the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential is the same as if the image charge were there.

Wait, if the image charge is q', then the sphere behaves as if it has a charge of q', so the total charge on the sphere would be Q = q'.

Wait, no. The image charge method is used to find the potential outside the sphere. The actual charge on the sphere would be induced, but in the method, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the total induced charge would be 2 q' ? Or maybe it's the same as the image charge.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the induced charge as Q = 2 (R² q) / d.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. Let me think again.

The image charge q' is given by q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is Q = q' = - ( R² q ) / d.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is grounded and has an image charge, then the induced charge would be such that the potential on the sphere is zero. Hmm, this is getting me confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere. So, the sphere's induced charge Q can be found by the condition that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

The potential at the sphere's surface due to both q and Q must be zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0.

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q. Since q is at distance d from the center, the potential at the sphere's surface (distance R from center) due to q is V_q = k q / (d), because the sphere's surface is at radius R and the charge q is at distance d, so the distance between q and the surface is (d - R) if they are colinear. Wait, no, that's only along that line.

Wait, but for an arbitrary point on the sphere, the distance from q is sqrt( d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ ), but integrating over the sphere's surface would be complicated. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential due to q would vary over the surface, but the conductor's charges rearrange to make the potential uniform.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the potential at the sphere's surface due to q and the induced charge Q. The potential must be zero, so:

k Q / R + k q / a = 0,

where a is the average distance from q to the sphere's surface. Hmm, but I don't know a. Maybe I can relate this using the image charge.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the image charge. The image charge method gives that the induced charge Q is such that the potential due to it and the image charge q' equals the potential due to the actual setup.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find Q.

The sphere's potential is zero. The potential on the sphere's surface is due to charge q and the sphere's own charge Q. So,

k Q / R + k q / (distance) = 0.

What's the distance? For a point on the sphere's surface, the distance from q is sqrt( d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the line from center to q and the line from center to the point on the sphere. But to find the average potential, it's tricky. But for a sphere, the potential on the surface due to an external charge can be considered as if the charge were at the center. Wait, no, that's not right. The potential due to a charge outside a sphere is the same as if the charge were at the center, but when the charge is inside, it's different.

Wait, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the potential on the sphere's surface due to the external charge is k q / (distance from q to the sphere's center) times some factor. Or is it simply k q / d? Because the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside is uniform, so the potential on the surface due to an external charge is the same as if that charge were at the center of the sphere.

Wait, I think that's the case. So, the potential on the sphere's surface due to charge q is V_q = k q / d.

Similarly, the potential on the sphere's surface due to its own charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R.

Since the sphere is grounded, the sum must be zero:

k q / d + k Q / R = 0.

Solving for Q,

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So the induced charge on the sphere is Q = - ( q R ) / d.

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check the units. [k] is N m²/C². [q] is Coulombs, [R] is meters, [d] is meters. So, Q has units of Coulombs, which is correct.

Now, the potential at the location of charge q (distance d from center) due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d.

Substituting Q,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * ( -k q R / d² ) = - k q² R / d².

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) U=- (1/2) kq² d/(d² +R²)

B) U=-k q² d/(d² -R² )

C) U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Hmm, none of these match -k q² R / d². So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let's go back.

I said that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, so k Q / R + k q / d = 0.

So,

Q = - q R / d.

But is that correct? Or is the potential due to q at the sphere's surface something else?

Wait, another approach: The potential due to a point charge q at a point on the sphere's surface is k q / r, where r is the distance between q and that point on the sphere. For a sphere, this distance varies, but the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is k q / (d), where d is the center-to-center distance. Wait, that's only true if the point is directly along the line. But for other points, it's different. However, because the sphere is a conductor, the potential must be the same everywhere on the surface. So how is that possible?

Ah, wait a minute. The induced charges on the sphere will create a potential that cancels the varying potential due to q. So, the presence of the induced charge Q makes the sum of potentials due to q and Q to be zero on the sphere's surface.

But perhaps I should consider that the potential due to q at the sphere's surface is k q / (d), assuming that the center of the sphere is at a distance d from q. No, wait, the center is at a distance d from q, but the surface is at a distance of d - R (if the point is on the same line as the center and q). Alternatively, the point on the sphere in the direction of q is at a distance d - R from q, and the opposite point is at d + R.

Wait, but the potential on the sphere's surface due to q would vary, but the conductor's induced charges (Q) must make the potential uniform.

Therefore, the average potential due to q on the sphere's surface must be accounted for.

Wait, another thought: The potential due to q on the sphere's surface is an average value, which for a point charge outside the sphere is k q / d, because the potential due to a charge outside a sphere is the same as if it were at the center. So, that's why the sphere's potential due to q is uniform.

So, assuming that, the potential due to q on the sphere's surface is V_q = k q / d.

The sphere's potential is zero, so the potential due to Q must be V_Q = - V_q = - k q / d.

But the potential due to Q at the surface is V_Q = k Q / R.

So,

k Q / R = - k q / d.

Solving for Q:

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, that's the same as before. So, the induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point at distance d from the sphere's center, in the presence of the sphere's induced charge.

So, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d. Substituting Q,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So, the potential energy U is q times this potential,

U = q * V = q * (-k q R / d² ) = - k q² R / d².

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the potential energy is the energy stored in the configuration of the two charges, q and the sphere's induced charge Q. So, the potential energy would be the work done to assemble both charges.

But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So, bringing charge q near the sphere would involve work done against the electric field created by the sphere's induced charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring q in the presence of Q, and the work done to bring Q in the presence of q.

Wait, that's more complicated. Let's think about it.

The potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. So, first, bring the sphere (neutral) into place. Then, bring charge q from infinity to point d. The work done when bringing q would be against the field created by the sphere's induced charge.

So,

U = work done = q * V_sphere,

where V_sphere is the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges.

As before, V_sphere = k Q / d.

So, U = q * (k Q / d).

But Q is the induced charge, which is - q R / d.

Wait, substituting,

U = q * (k (- q R / d ) / d ) = - k q² R / d².

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the method I'm using is incorrect because the sphere's induced charge is not just a point charge. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the sphere as a point charge located at the center, but it's grounded.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of a charge q in the electric field of another charge Q is U = k q Q / r. Here, r is the distance between the charges. So, if the sphere's induced charge is Q, and the charge q is at distance d from the center, then,

U = k q Q / d.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at infinity is zero, so the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to Q is V_Q = k Q / R = 0. Therefore, Q must be zero. That can't be right because we have an induced charge.

Wait, no. The sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. The potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which is the sum of potentials from all charges. So, when bringing charge q near, the sphere's induced charges adjust to make sure that the potential on its surface is zero.

So, another way: The potential at the location of charge q is due to the sphere's induced charge Q. The potential energy is then U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's location due to Q.

But how do I find V?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field between q and the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential outside the sphere is as if the induced charge were at the center. So, the potential at distance d due to the sphere's charge Q is k Q / d.

But the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which gives us:

k Q / R + k q / d = 0.

So,

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, substituting back,

V = k Q / d = k ( - q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

Thus, U = q * V = - k q² R / d².

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should include the work done in assembling both charges: the charge q and the induced charge Q.

The potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q Q / r, where r is the distance between them.

Wait, that might be the case. Because when you bring q and Q together, each does work on the other. So the total potential energy is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

But why 1/2? Because when you bring two charges together, each feels the field of the other, so the work done is the integral of F times dr, which for each charge is the same, but you only account for it once with a 1/2 factor.

So, perhaps the correct expression is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) k q ( - q R / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q² R / d².

Hmm, but that still doesn't match any option. Wait, looking at the options again, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about Q. Maybe the induced charge isn't simply Q = - q R / d.

Wait, perhaps I should use the image charge method correctly. Let's recall that when a charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R² / d.

The image charge is negative: q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is then Q = q' = - R² q / d.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Earlier I thought Q was - q R / d, but with the image charge method, it's Q = - R² q / d.

So, if Q = - R² q / d, then the potential energy U is (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q,

U = (1/2) k q ( - R² q / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q² R² / d².

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). That's not the same as what I have.

Wait, but what's the correct formula for the induced charge? Because I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, another approach: The method of images for a grounded sphere.

When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is located inside the sphere, at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R² / d.

And the image charge has a magnitude q' = ( R² / d ) q.

But since the sphere is grounded, the image charge is negative. So, q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

The total charge on the sphere is then Q = q' (the image charge).

So, Q = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the potential at the location of q (distance d from center) due to the sphere's charge Q is V = k Q / (d + d')?

Wait, no. The potential at q's location due to Q is simply k Q / d, because Q is at the center of the sphere.

So, V = k ( - R² q / d ) / d = - k R² q / d².

The potential energy U is q * V = q * ( -k R² q / d² ) = -k R² q² / d².

Hmm, this still doesn't match any option. Let me look again.

Options:

A) U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² )

B) U = -k q² d/(d² - R² )

C) U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Hmm, none match -k R² q² / d².

So perhaps my approach is entirely wrong.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charge Q. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charge is due to q's presence, so perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k q Q / d, where Q is the induced charge.

Earlier, using image charge, I have Q = - R² q / d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q (- R² q / d ) / d = - (1/2) k R² q² / d².

But this still doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the two charges, but considering the sphere's induced charge as a point charge at the center. So the potential energy would be (1/2) k q Q / d, where Q is the sphere's induced charge.

But I need to find Q correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k Q² R / something, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The potential energy can be calculated as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a point outside the sphere, considering the potential created by the sphere.

But the sphere, being grounded, has a potential of zero. So the potential at the point where q is brought to is V = k Q / d, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero. So, the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charge, which is V = k Q / d.

The work done in bringing q is W = q V = q (k Q / d).

But the potential at the sphere's surface is zero, so:

k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - q R / d.

So, W = q * (k (- q R / d ) / d ) = - k q² R / d².

But again, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should include the potential energy stored in the sphere's induced charge as well. So, the total potential energy is the sum of the energy to bring q, the energy of the induced charge Q, and the interaction energy between them.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the mutual potential energy between the charge q and the sphere's induced charge.

The mutual potential energy is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

But since Q = - R² q / d,

U = (1/2) k q ( - R² q / d ) / d = - (1/2) k R² q² / d².

Again, same result as before.

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor or the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is not Q = - R² q / d, but something else.

Wait, another approach: The potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_induced = 0.

V_q is the potential due to charge q at the sphere's surface, which for a sphere is k q / d, because the sphere's radius is R, and the distance from q to the center is d. For a sphere, the potential due to an external charge q is the same as if it were at the center, so V_q = k q / d.

V_induced is the potential due to the sphere's induced charge Q. The potential on the surface due to Q is k Q / R.

So,

k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, the induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

Thus, the potential at the location of q due to Q is V = k Q / d = -k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = - k q² R / d².

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field due to the two charges, q and Q, which is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R / d ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

This also doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the potential due to the sphere as a point charge at the center. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential at the surface is zero.

The potential at the center of the sphere is zero. The potential at distance d from the center (where q is located) due to the sphere's induced charge is k Q / d.

But the sphere's induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

So,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy is U = q * V = - k q² R / d².

Still no match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

But my result doesn't have a (d² - R²) in the denominator. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded sphere is known and involves (d² - R²). Let me think about what the correct formula should be.

Wait, another method: The potential energy U of the system can be found by considering the energy stored in the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. The energy stored is (1/2) Q² / C, where C is the capacitance of the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its capacitance is C = 4 π ε₀ R.

Wait, but the charge on the sphere is Q, so the energy is (1/2) Q² C.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, the potential energy can be considered as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

The potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charge Q.

But the sphere's induced charge Q is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So,

k Q / R + k q / (d - R) =0.

Wait, because the distance from q to the surface is d - R (assuming d > R).

Wait, but that's only along the line of centers. For other points, the distance varies, but the potential due to q on the sphere's surface must be uniform because it's a conductor.

So, perhaps the correct way is to model the potential due to q on the sphere's surface as k q / (d), as earlier.

Thus, V_sphere = k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - q R / d.

So, the potential at the location of q due to Q is V = k Q / d = -k q R / d².

U = q * V = -k q² R / d².

But this still doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere.

I think I remember that the potential energy U is given by:

U = - (1/2) k q² (R²)/(d² - R²).

Wait, but I can't recall exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is U = (k q^2 R^2)/(2 d (d^2 - R^2)).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of images correctly. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, at distance R²/d from the center.

The image charge is q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge q and the image charge, but since the image charge is inside the sphere, its potential is due to q and itself.

Wait, but the image charge method is used to find the potential, not the potential energy.

Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q and the image charge q' into their positions.

So, U = (1/2) k q q' / (d - d'), where d' is the distance of the image charge from the center.

Wait, no, the image charge is inside, so the distance between q and q' is d - d' = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q q' / ( (d² - R²)/d ) )

q' is - R² q / d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * ( - R² q / d ) * (d) / (d² - R² )

= (1/2) * k * (- R² q² ) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Which matches option C.

Yes! So the correct answer is option C.

To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its potential is zero at its surface. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface to maintain the potential at zero. The induced charge \( Q \) on the sphere can be determined using the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

### Key Steps:
1. **Induced Charge on the Sphere**:  
   The potential at the sphere's surface due to the external charge \( q \) is \( V_q = \frac{kq}{d} \). For the sphere's surface potential to remain zero, the induced charge \( Q \) must create a potential \( V_Q = -V_q \). The potential at the surface due to \( Q \) is \( V_Q = \frac{kQ}{R} \). Equating \( V_Q = -V_q \), we find:  
   \[
   Q = -\frac{qR}{d}.
   \]

2. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position at distance \( d \) from the sphere's center. The potential at the location of \( q \) due to the sphere's induced charge \( Q \) is:  
   \[
   V = \frac{kQ}{d}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( Q = -\frac{qR}{d} \), we get:  
   \[
   V = -\frac{kqR}{d^2}.
   \]  
   The potential energy is then:  
   \[
   U = q \cdot V = -\frac{kq^2R}{d^2}.
   \]

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   Using the method of images, the induced charge \( Q \) can also be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, and its magnitude is \( q' = -\frac{R^2q}{d} \). The potential energy of the system is the mutual potential energy between \( q \) and \( q' \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{kqq'}{d - d'}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2q}{d} \) and \( d - d' = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we find:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The net potential energy of the system is given by:  
\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]  
This matches **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given as A to D, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But since it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons. Oh right, a grounded conductor will have its potential at zero. Wait, no, actually, the ground is at zero potential, so the conductor's potential is the same as the ground.

So the conducting sphere must be at zero potential. Now, when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges will adjust to maintain the potential at zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? Potential energy in a system of charges... Hmm. I remember that the potential energy of a charge in the presence of another charge configuration is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to its position. But here, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges on it are induced.

I think the conducting sphere, when grounded, will have an induced charge opposite to q. Because when you bring a positive charge near a conductor, electrons in the conductor (since it's grounded) will move to the near side, leaving the far side positive. Or wait, no, wait—conductor being neutral, when a positive charge is brought near, the conductor's electrons move toward the charge, leaving the far side positive. But since it's grounded, those excess charges can leave the sphere. So the sphere ends up with a charge opposite to q, but wait, no—wait, the sphere would have an induced charge opposite to q, but since it's grounded, the excess charge can leave. So the sphere's net charge would be...?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the system. The charge q is outside the sphere. The sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges will be on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential must be zero.

I think the potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere's center. But the presence of the sphere affects the potential that the charge q experiences.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the sphere as a point charge at its center, because for points outside a conducting sphere, the potential behaves as if all the charge were at the center. But wait, that's for the potential due to the sphere itself. But in this case, the sphere is grounded, so its charge is adjusted to keep its potential at zero. Wait, but how?

Wait, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges will cause an effective potential at the location of q. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential due to the sphere at the point where q is placed... Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: The potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. So, if we have the charge q and the sphere. The sphere is grounded, so when we bring q near it, the sphere's induced charges will adjust, but the sphere as a whole doesn't contribute any potential energy since its potential is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is just the self-energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another way: The conducting sphere can be considered as having a charge Q. But since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. The potential at a distance d from the center (where charge q is placed) due to the sphere is that of a point charge Q at the center. So the potential at that point is V = kQ/d.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential due to the sphere at its own surface is zero, which gives V = 0 at r=R. So, the potential at a distance d from the center (d > R) is V = kQ/(d). But the sphere's potential is zero at its surface, so substituting r=R gives V = kQ/R = 0 → Q must be zero? That can't be right, because when you bring a charge near, the sphere's induced charges are non-zero.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The sphere is conducting, so the induced charges are such that the potential is zero at the surface. So, if I have a charge q outside, the sphere's potential is due to both q and its own induced charges. But the sphere's potential must be zero everywhere on it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the sphere as having a charge Q, but the system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to d, considering the potential created by the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at infinity is the same as on the sphere.

Wait, no, the ground is at zero potential. So the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential due to the charge q at any point in space is V_q = kq/(r'), where r' is the distance from q to that point. But the sphere is a conductor, so the potential is the same across its surface, which is zero.

So, perhaps the potential at the center of the sphere is the same as the surface. Wait, no, the potential inside a conductor is the same as on the surface. So the potential at the center is zero as well.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of image charges. There's a method where a grounded sphere can be modeled using an image charge.

Wait, I remember that for a point charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere can be treated as having an image charge. The image charge method is used to find the induced charges.

In the case of a grounded sphere, the image charge would be inside the sphere. Let me recall the formula. The image charge q' is given by q' = -q (R/d'), where d' is the distance from the charge q to the center, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps the image charge approach isn't the right way here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere is the potential created by the sphere's induced charges. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential at the point where q is located, which is d away from the center (so outside the sphere, since d > R), is due to the charge q and the sphere's charge.

Wait, no. The sphere's charge is induced by q. The potential at the location of q would be due to the sphere's induced charge. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which affects the potential elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the mutual potential energy between q and the induced charges on the sphere. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The system's potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges. So, initially, both the charge q and the conducting sphere are neutral. Then, when we bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, the sphere will have induced charges. But since it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere remains zero. Wait, wait—if the sphere is conducting and neutral, and I bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges will be +Q and -Q, but since it's grounded, the -Q can flow away, leaving the sphere with a charge of +Q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If I bring a positive charge q near a neutral conducting sphere that's grounded, the electrons in the sphere (which is neutral, so equal + and - charges) will be attracted to the near side of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the excess negative charge can leave the sphere, leaving the sphere with a positive charge. So the sphere would have a positive charge Q.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can flow to or from the ground. So, considering that, when I bring a positive charge q near, electrons from the sphere will move to the ground, leaving the sphere with a positive charge Q. The induced charge on the sphere would be Q, equal in magnitude to q? Or is it something else.

Wait, I think the induced charge on the sphere will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential due to the charge q and the sphere's own charge Q must sum to zero at the sphere's surface.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = kq/(R + d'), where d' is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. Wait, but charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the distance from q to the surface is d - R, assuming d > R.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is kq/(d - R + R) = kq/(d). Wait, no, wait. The distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface would vary depending on where on the sphere that point is. But for a conductor, the potential is uniform across the surface. So we can model the potential at the sphere's surface as the potential due to charge q and the sphere's own charge Q.

Wait, but the sphere's charge Q would produce a potential of kQ/R at its surface. The potential due to q at the sphere's surface is kq/(d'), where d' is the distance from q to the point on the sphere.

But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on it. The sphere is grounded, so the potential on it is zero. Therefore, the sum of the potentials due to q and Q at the sphere's surface must be zero.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is due to both the external charge q and its own charge Q. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to q. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so the potential is the same everywhere on it. So, the potential at any point on the sphere is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to Q.

But since the sphere is grounded, that potential is zero. So,

k Q / R + k q / R' = 0,

where R' is the distance from q to a point on the sphere.

Wait, but the distance from q to the sphere's surface is not uniform; it depends on where on the sphere. Oh, but for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is uniform across the sphere's surface?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the method of images. For a conducting sphere, when a charge is placed outside, the induced charges can be modeled using an image charge inside the sphere.

In the method of images, the image charge q' is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, on the same line as q and the sphere's center. The image charge q' is negative if the sphere is conducting and neutral. So the induced charge on the sphere is 2 q' R^2/(d - R) or something like that? Wait, perhaps I should think of the image charge as being inside the sphere.

Alternatively, I remember that for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' of a charge q at distance d (d > R) from the center is given by q' = -(R^2 / d) q. So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance of R^2/d from the center towards q.

So, the total charge induced on the sphere would be Q = q' + q'' (but I'm not sure about that). Wait, no. The image charge method tells us that the induced charge on the sphere is equal to the image charge. Or is it that the image charge represents the induced charges?

Wait, the image charge method is used to find the potential outside the sphere. So, the potential outside is as if there were a charge q at distance d and an image charge q' at distance d' inside. The sum of the potentials from these two would give the same result as the potential due to the actual induced charges.

But in any case, the presence of the sphere causes the potential at the location of q to change.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q into the vicinity of the sphere, which would be the potential at that point multiplied by q.

But the potential at q's location is due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, the sphere's induced charge is Q. So, the potential at q's location (distance d from the center) due to Q is V = k Q / d.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, which would give us a relation between Q and q.

Wait, let me think again. The potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential due to Q at the surface is kQ/R. The potential due to q at the surface is kq/(d), since q is at distance d from the center, so the average distance from q to the surface is d - R? Or is it the other way? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is k q / (d), because the distance from q to the center is d, so the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface is d (since the sphere is at the center). Wait, no, that's only if the point is directly towards or away from q. But for other points, it's different. But the average would depend on the solid angle. Alternatively, for the purpose of potential calculation, the potential due to an external charge q at a point on the sphere's surface is k q / (distance from q to that point). But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. So, the potential at the surface due to q and the sphere's charge must add up to zero.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the system's potential energy. The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away, which is in the field of the sphere's induced charges.

The potential at d due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d. So, the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q / d).

But I need to find Q in terms of q and d. How?

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential on the surface is due to both q and Q.

So, V_surface = V_q + V_Q = 0.

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q. The distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface is variable, but since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere. So, for a conducting sphere, the potential due to an external charge q can be considered as if the charge were at the center. Wait, that makes sense because inside a conductor, the charges rearrange such that the electric field is zero, so the potential is the same throughout.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / R, because for a sphere, the potential outside at distance R is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So, the distance would be R.

Wait, but wait, no. The charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the potential due to q at the sphere's surface is not k q / R. It would be k q / r, where r is the distance from q to the point on the sphere. But for a point on the sphere, that distance varies. Hmm, but because of the spherical symmetry, the average potential due to an external charge would be the same as if the charge were at the center. So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / d, because the distance from q to the center is d, and for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is the same as if it were at the center. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the image charge method is easier. The image charge q' is located inside the sphere, at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R^2 / d.

The image charge is q' = - ( R^2 q ) / d.

So, the sphere's induced charge is equal to the image charge q', so Q = q' = - R² q / d.

But wait, isn't the image charge just a model? Because the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential is the same as if the image charge were there.

Wait, if the image charge is q', then the sphere behaves as if it has a charge of q', so the total charge on the sphere would be Q = q'.

Wait, no. The image charge method is used to find the potential outside the sphere. The actual charge on the sphere would be induced, but in the method, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the total induced charge would be 2 q' ? Or maybe it's the same as the image charge.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the induced charge as Q = 2 (R² q) / d.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. Let me think again.

The image charge q' is given by q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is Q = q' = - ( R² q ) / d.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is grounded and has an image charge, then the induced charge would be such that the potential on the sphere is zero. Hmm, this is getting me confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere. So, the sphere's induced charge Q can be found by the condition that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

The potential at the sphere's surface due to both q and Q must be zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0.

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q. Since q is at distance d from the center, the potential at the sphere's surface (distance R from center) due to q is V_q = k q / (d), because the sphere's surface is at radius R and the charge q is at distance d, so the distance between q and the surface is (d - R) if they are colinear. Wait, no, that's only along that line.

Wait, but for an arbitrary point on the sphere, the distance from q is sqrt( d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ ), but integrating over the sphere's surface would be complicated. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential due to q would vary over the surface, but the conductor's charges rearrange to make the potential uniform.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the potential at the sphere's surface due to q and the induced charge Q. The potential must be zero, so:

k Q / R + k q / a = 0,

where a is the average distance from q to the sphere's surface. Hmm, but I don't know a. Maybe I can relate this using the image charge.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the image charge. The image charge method gives that the induced charge Q is such that the potential due to it and the image charge q' equals the potential due to the actual setup.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find Q.

The sphere's potential is zero. The potential on the sphere's surface is due to charge q and the sphere's own charge Q. So,

k Q / R + k q / (distance) = 0.

What's the distance? For a point on the sphere's surface, the distance from q is sqrt( d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the line from center to q and the line from center to the point on the sphere. But to find the average potential, it's tricky. But for a sphere, the potential on the surface due to an external charge can be considered as if the charge were at the center. Wait, no, that's not right. The potential due to a charge outside a sphere is the same as if the charge were at the center, but when the charge is inside, it's different.

Wait, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the potential on the sphere's surface due to the external charge is k q / (distance from q to the sphere's center) times some factor. Or is it simply k q / d? Because the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside is uniform, so the potential on the surface due to an external charge is the same as if that charge were at the center of the sphere.

Wait, I think that's the case. So, the potential on the sphere's surface due to charge q is V_q = k q / d.

Similarly, the potential on the sphere's surface due to its own charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R.

Since the sphere is grounded, the sum must be zero:

k q / d + k Q / R = 0.

Solving for Q,

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So the induced charge on the sphere is Q = - ( q R ) / d.

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check the units. [k] is N m²/C². [q] is Coulombs, [R] is meters, [d] is meters. So, Q has units of Coulombs, which is correct.

Now, the potential at the location of charge q (distance d from center) due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d.

Substituting Q,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * ( -k q R / d² ) = - k q² R / d².

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) U=- (1/2) kq² d/(d² +R²)

B) U=-k q² d/(d² -R² )

C) U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Hmm, none of these match -k q² R / d². So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let's go back.

I said that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, so k Q / R + k q / d = 0.

So,

Q = - q R / d.

But is that correct? Or is the potential due to q at the sphere's surface something else?

Wait, another approach: The potential due to a point charge q at a point on the sphere's surface is k q / r, where r is the distance between q and that point on the sphere. For a sphere, this distance varies, but the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is k q / (d), where d is the center-to-center distance. Wait, that's only true if the point is directly along the line. But for other points, it's different. However, because the sphere is a conductor, the potential must be the same everywhere on the surface. So how is that possible?

Ah, wait a minute. The induced charges on the sphere will create a potential that cancels the varying potential due to q. So, the presence of the induced charge Q makes the sum of potentials due to q and Q to be zero on the sphere's surface.

But perhaps I should consider that the potential due to q at the sphere's surface is k q / (d), assuming that the center of the sphere is at a distance d from q. No, wait, the center is at a distance d from q, but the surface is at a distance of d - R (if the point is on the same line as the center and q). Alternatively, the point on the sphere in the direction of q is at a distance d - R from q, and the opposite point is at d + R.

Wait, but the potential on the sphere's surface due to q would vary, but the conductor's induced charges (Q) must make the potential uniform.

Therefore, the average potential due to q on the sphere's surface must be accounted for.

Wait, another thought: The potential due to q on the sphere's surface is an average value, which for a point charge outside the sphere is k q / d, because the potential due to a charge outside a sphere is the same as if it were at the center. So, that's why the sphere's potential due to q is uniform.

So, assuming that, the potential due to q on the sphere's surface is V_q = k q / d.

The sphere's potential is zero, so the potential due to Q must be V_Q = - V_q = - k q / d.

But the potential due to Q at the surface is V_Q = k Q / R.

So,

k Q / R = - k q / d.

Solving for Q:

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, that's the same as before. So, the induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point at distance d from the sphere's center, in the presence of the sphere's induced charge.

So, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charge Q is V = k Q / d. Substituting Q,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So, the potential energy U is q times this potential,

U = q * V = q * (-k q R / d² ) = - k q² R / d².

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the potential energy is the energy stored in the configuration of the two charges, q and the sphere's induced charge Q. So, the potential energy would be the work done to assemble both charges.

But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So, bringing charge q near the sphere would involve work done against the electric field created by the sphere's induced charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring q in the presence of Q, and the work done to bring Q in the presence of q.

Wait, that's more complicated. Let's think about it.

The potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. So, first, bring the sphere (neutral) into place. Then, bring charge q from infinity to point d. The work done when bringing q would be against the field created by the sphere's induced charge.

So,

U = work done = q * V_sphere,

where V_sphere is the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges.

As before, V_sphere = k Q / d.

So, U = q * (k Q / d).

But Q is the induced charge, which is - q R / d.

Wait, substituting,

U = q * (k (- q R / d ) / d ) = - k q² R / d².

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the method I'm using is incorrect because the sphere's induced charge is not just a point charge. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the sphere as a point charge located at the center, but it's grounded.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of a charge q in the electric field of another charge Q is U = k q Q / r. Here, r is the distance between the charges. So, if the sphere's induced charge is Q, and the charge q is at distance d from the center, then,

U = k q Q / d.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at infinity is zero, so the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to Q is V_Q = k Q / R = 0. Therefore, Q must be zero. That can't be right because we have an induced charge.

Wait, no. The sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. The potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which is the sum of potentials from all charges. So, when bringing charge q near, the sphere's induced charges adjust to make sure that the potential on its surface is zero.

So, another way: The potential at the location of charge q is due to the sphere's induced charge Q. The potential energy is then U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's location due to Q.

But how do I find V?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field between q and the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential outside the sphere is as if the induced charge were at the center. So, the potential at distance d due to the sphere's charge Q is k Q / d.

But the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which gives us:

k Q / R + k q / d = 0.

So,

Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, substituting back,

V = k Q / d = k ( - q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

Thus, U = q * V = - k q² R / d².

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should include the work done in assembling both charges: the charge q and the induced charge Q.

The potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q Q / r, where r is the distance between them.

Wait, that might be the case. Because when you bring q and Q together, each does work on the other. So the total potential energy is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

But why 1/2? Because when you bring two charges together, each feels the field of the other, so the work done is the integral of F times dr, which for each charge is the same, but you only account for it once with a 1/2 factor.

So, perhaps the correct expression is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) k q ( - q R / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q² R / d².

Hmm, but that still doesn't match any option. Wait, looking at the options again, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about Q. Maybe the induced charge isn't simply Q = - q R / d.

Wait, perhaps I should use the image charge method correctly. Let's recall that when a charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R² / d.

The image charge is negative: q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is then Q = q' = - R² q / d.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Earlier I thought Q was - q R / d, but with the image charge method, it's Q = - R² q / d.

So, if Q = - R² q / d, then the potential energy U is (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q,

U = (1/2) k q ( - R² q / d ) / d.

= - (1/2) k q² R² / d².

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). That's not the same as what I have.

Wait, but what's the correct formula for the induced charge? Because I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, another approach: The method of images for a grounded sphere.

When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is located inside the sphere, at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R² / d.

And the image charge has a magnitude q' = ( R² / d ) q.

But since the sphere is grounded, the image charge is negative. So, q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

The total charge on the sphere is then Q = q' (the image charge).

So, Q = - ( R² / d ) q.

So, the potential at the location of q (distance d from center) due to the sphere's charge Q is V = k Q / (d + d')?

Wait, no. The potential at q's location due to Q is simply k Q / d, because Q is at the center of the sphere.

So, V = k ( - R² q / d ) / d = - k R² q / d².

The potential energy U is q * V = q * ( -k R² q / d² ) = -k R² q² / d².

Hmm, this still doesn't match any option. Let me look again.

Options:

A) U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² )

B) U = -k q² d/(d² - R² )

C) U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

D) U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Hmm, none match -k R² q² / d².

So perhaps my approach is entirely wrong.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charge Q. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charge is due to q's presence, so perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k q Q / d, where Q is the induced charge.

Earlier, using image charge, I have Q = - R² q / d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q (- R² q / d ) / d = - (1/2) k R² q² / d².

But this still doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the two charges, but considering the sphere's induced charge as a point charge at the center. So the potential energy would be (1/2) k q Q / d, where Q is the sphere's induced charge.

But I need to find Q correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k Q² R / something, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The potential energy can be calculated as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a point outside the sphere, considering the potential created by the sphere.

But the sphere, being grounded, has a potential of zero. So the potential at the point where q is brought to is V = k Q / d, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero. So, the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charge, which is V = k Q / d.

The work done in bringing q is W = q V = q (k Q / d).

But the potential at the sphere's surface is zero, so:

k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - q R / d.

So, W = q * (k (- q R / d ) / d ) = - k q² R / d².

But again, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should include the potential energy stored in the sphere's induced charge as well. So, the total potential energy is the sum of the energy to bring q, the energy of the induced charge Q, and the interaction energy between them.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the mutual potential energy between the charge q and the sphere's induced charge.

The mutual potential energy is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

But since Q = - R² q / d,

U = (1/2) k q ( - R² q / d ) / d = - (1/2) k R² q² / d².

Again, same result as before.

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor or the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is not Q = - R² q / d, but something else.

Wait, another approach: The potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_induced = 0.

V_q is the potential due to charge q at the sphere's surface, which for a sphere is k q / d, because the sphere's radius is R, and the distance from q to the center is d. For a sphere, the potential due to an external charge q is the same as if it were at the center, so V_q = k q / d.

V_induced is the potential due to the sphere's induced charge Q. The potential on the surface due to Q is k Q / R.

So,

k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, the induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

Thus, the potential at the location of q due to Q is V = k Q / d = -k q R / d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = - k q² R / d².

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field due to the two charges, q and Q, which is U = (1/2) k q Q / d.

Substituting Q = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R / d ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

This also doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the potential due to the sphere as a point charge at the center. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential at the surface is zero.

The potential at the center of the sphere is zero. The potential at distance d from the center (where q is located) due to the sphere's induced charge is k Q / d.

But the sphere's induced charge is Q = - q R / d.

So,

V = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

So the potential energy is U = q * V = - k q² R / d².

Still no match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

But my result doesn't have a (d² - R²) in the denominator. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded sphere is known and involves (d² - R²). Let me think about what the correct formula should be.

Wait, another method: The potential energy U of the system can be found by considering the energy stored in the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. The energy stored is (1/2) Q² / C, where C is the capacitance of the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its capacitance is C = 4 π ε₀ R.

Wait, but the charge on the sphere is Q, so the energy is (1/2) Q² C.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, the potential energy can be considered as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

The potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charge Q.

But the sphere's induced charge Q is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So,

k Q / R + k q / (d - R) =0.

Wait, because the distance from q to the surface is d - R (assuming d > R).

Wait, but that's only along the line of centers. For other points, the distance varies, but the potential due to q on the sphere's surface must be uniform because it's a conductor.

So, perhaps the correct way is to model the potential due to q on the sphere's surface as k q / (d), as earlier.

Thus, V_sphere = k Q / R + k q / d = 0 → Q = - q R / d.

So, the potential at the location of q due to Q is V = k Q / d = -k q R / d².

U = q * V = -k q² R / d².

But this still doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere.

I think I remember that the potential energy U is given by:

U = - (1/2) k q² (R²)/(d² - R²).

Wait, but I can't recall exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is U = (k q^2 R^2)/(2 d (d^2 - R^2)).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of images correctly. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, at distance R²/d from the center.

The image charge is q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge q and the image charge, but since the image charge is inside the sphere, its potential is due to q and itself.

Wait, but the image charge method is used to find the potential, not the potential energy.

Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q and the image charge q' into their positions.

So, U = (1/2) k q q' / (d - d'), where d' is the distance of the image charge from the center.

Wait, no, the image charge is inside, so the distance between q and q' is d - d' = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q q' / ( (d² - R²)/d ) )

q' is - R² q / d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * ( - R² q / d ) * (d) / (d² - R² )

= (1/2) * k * (- R² q² ) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Which matches option C.

Yes! So the correct answer is option C.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its potential is zero at its surface. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface to maintain the potential at zero. The induced charge \( Q \) on the sphere can be determined using the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

### Key Steps:
1. **Induced Charge on the Sphere**:  
   The potential at the sphere's surface due to the external charge \( q \) is \( V_q = \frac{kq}{d} \). For the sphere's surface potential to remain zero, the induced charge \( Q \) must create a potential \( V_Q = -V_q \). The potential at the surface due to \( Q \) is \( V_Q = \frac{kQ}{R} \). Equating \( V_Q = -V_q \), we find:  
   \[
   Q = -\frac{qR}{d}.
   \]

2. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position at distance \( d \) from the sphere's center. The potential at the location of \( q \) due to the sphere's induced charge \( Q \) is:  
   \[
   V = \frac{kQ}{d}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( Q = -\frac{qR}{d} \), we get:  
   \[
   V = -\frac{kqR}{d^2}.
   \]  
   The potential energy is then:  
   \[
   U = q \cdot V = -\frac{kq^2R}{d^2}.
   \]

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   Using the method of images, the induced charge \( Q \) can also be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, and its magnitude is \( q' = -\frac{R^2q}{d} \). The potential energy of the system is the mutual potential energy between \( q \) and \( q' \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{kqq'}{d - d'}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2q}{d} \) and \( d - d' = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we find:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The net potential energy of the system is given by:  
\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]  
This matches **Option C**.

Answer: C
