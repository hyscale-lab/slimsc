Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a different universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would change in such a scenario. Let me think through what I remember about Maxwell's equations and how magnets work.

In our universe, magnets are dipoles; they have both a North and South pole. I remember that one of Maxwell's equations deals with the divergence of the magnetic field, B. The equation says that the divergence of B is zero, which implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges, right? Because if you have a divergence, it's like sources or sinks, but for B, there are none. So that equation is ∇·B = 0.

But in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, that means there could be magnetic monopoles. If that's the case, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because if a region has a magnetic charge (like a single pole), the divergence would represent that charge density. So the equation ∇·B = 0 would change to something like ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes.

Wait, what about the other Maxwell's equations? Let me recall them. Maxwell's equations are four in total:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetic fields)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère-Maxwell law)

So, in our universe, equation 2 is zero because no magnetic monopoles. But in the other scenario, equation 2 would change.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. So equation 2 would be different. Are there any others?

I think about how the existence of magnetic monopoles affects the equations. The other equations might not change. Let me think: Gauss's law for E is about electric charge, which isn't directly affected by magnetic monopoles. Faraday's law deals with the curl of E being related to the time change of B. If B has sources, would that affect the curl? Maybe not directly. The Ampère-Maxwell law is about the curl of B, which is related to current and the time derivative of E. But if B has a divergence, maybe that's the only equation that changes.

Wait, let me think again. The original Maxwell's equations, equation 2 is about divergence of B. The other equations involve the curl of E and B, their time derivatives, etc. So with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 changes. What about equation 1, which is about the divergence of E?

No, equation 1 is about electric charge. Unless magnetic monopoles somehow affect electric fields, but I don't think so. So only equation 2 would change.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says only equation 2. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 2. So that would change.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and divergence of B. Wait, the circulation of E is equation 3. So that's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. Why would that change? I don't see why. Unless in this universe, the presence of magnetic charges affects the relation between E and B. But Faraday's law in our universe just relates the curl of E to the rate of change of B. If B can have sources, would that affect the curl of E? Maybe not. So perhaps equation 3 remains the same.

Wait then, if only equation 2 is changed, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the ones related to divergence and curl of B. Wait, no, equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B. So if equation 2 changes, and equation 4? Hmm, equation 4 is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic currents (like moving monopoles), perhaps that would introduce another term. Oh wait, but in our universe, without monopoles, equation 4 is curl B equals something. If you have magnetic monopoles, you might also have magnetic current density, so the equation would need to account for that. So perhaps equation 4 would also change.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. In our universe, the curl of B is due to electric currents and the time derivative of E. If there are magnetic monopoles, would there be a term involving the current of magnetic charges? I think that Maxwell's equations, when extended to include magnetic monopoles, have two more terms. Specifically, the modified equations would include terms for magnetic charge density and magnetic current density.

So the four equations would become:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / ε₀ (or something like that; I'm not sure)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + something involving J_m?

Wait, I'm not exactly remembering, but I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, the other equations besides equation 2 also get modified. For example, the curl of E would include a term related to the magnetic current or vice versa.

Wait, Faraday's law in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have an extra term. The usual Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if there are magnetic currents, you might have something like ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m. Or maybe J_m is included in another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law gets an extra term for the magnetic current.

Wait, I think that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the four equations become symmetric:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / ε₀
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + (1/c²) ∂E/∂t? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, equation 4 would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, I've heard that to make Maxwell's equations symmetric when magnetic monopoles exist, the equations would include terms for magnetic charge and current in the other equations. So equation 3 would change, and equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, but in the question, the scenario is that Maxwell's equations look different. So which of the four equations are altered?

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. In this other universe, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m. So that's one change.

But are there others? Let me think about the other equations.

Equation 3: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, that would imply that the curl of E is not just the time derivative of B but also includes a term from the magnetic current. So equation 3 would change.

Similarly, equation 4 would involve a term with the magnetic current. So equation 4 would also change.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

In normal Maxwell's equations without monopoles:

Equation 1: electric flux divergence is rho_e / epsilon0.

Equation 2: magnetic flux divergence is zero.

Equation 3: curl of E is minus the time derivative of B.

Equation 4: curl of B is mu0 times J_e plus displacement current.

So with monopoles, equation 2 becomes non-zero.

Now, equation 3: if you have a magnetic current, would it affect the curl of E? Or would the curl of B be affected?

Wait, when you have a magnetic current density J_m (like a current of monopoles moving), it's similar to how electric current J_e affects equation 4. So perhaps equation 3 would get a term involving J_m.

Wait, no, because equation 3 is about E's curl. If you have a magnetic current, that might affect B's time derivative, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe equation 4 would have a term from J_m.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become symmetric. So equation 2: ∇·B = rho_m / mu0.

Equation 3 becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / epsilon0.

Equation 4: ∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + (some term involving J_m? Or perhaps a term involving J_m in the equation for ∇×B.)

Wait, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law would have an additional term. Let me think. Without monopoles, equation 4 is:

∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t

If you have magnetic currents, perhaps the equation would also include a term from the magnetic current, but I'm not sure exactly how. Maybe equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. Alternatively, maybe that term would be part of another equation.

Wait, I think that the presence of magnetic monopoles would require two changes: equation 2 becomes non-zero (div B = rho_m) and equation 3 (curl E) gets a term involving J_m, and equation 4 gets a term involving J_m as well. But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach.

In standard Maxwell's equations, the equations are symmetrical except for electric and magnetic aspects. So when you have monopoles, you can make the equations symmetric by adding terms for magnetic charge and current.

So equation 2: div B = rho_m.

Equation 3: curl E = -dB/dt - J_m.

Equation 4: curl B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 dE/dt + J_m'.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which equations are directly affected. The scenario is that the universe allows isolated N and S poles. So equation 2 must change because it's about the divergence of B, which is zero in our world but non-zero here.

But wait, the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. So the options are about which equations are altered.

Looking back at the options, option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 (divergence) and equation 4 (curl) would change. Is that the case?

Wait, equation 4 is the curl of B. Would that change? In our universe, equation 4 includes the displacement current and the electric current. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect equation 4?

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) would change as well. Let me think: equation 3 is about the electric field's curl being related to the time derivative of B. But if there are magnetic currents, would that introduce a term in equation 3?

I'm not entirely sure, but from what I remember, the presence of magnetic monopoles would affect two of Maxwell's equations. In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. If monopoles exist, it's ∇·B = (some term). Also, equation 3, which is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would include a term involving the magnetic current. Because, similar to how equation 4 includes the displacement current, equation 3 would have a current term.

Wait, but equation 3 is about the electric field. So perhaps equation 3 would include a term for magnetic current, and equation 4 would have a term for something else. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same.

Alternatively, maybe the magnetic monopoles affect equation 4 by adding a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, I remember that when you have magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / mu0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m / epsilon0
4. ∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_m / (c^2) )

Wait, that's getting a bit more concrete. So equation 3 would now have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current.

So in this scenario, equation 2, equation 3, and equation 4 would change? Or only equation 2 and equation 3?

Wait, no. Equation 4 in our universe doesn't have a term involving J_m. If we have magnetic monopoles, perhaps equation 4 would also get a term for the displacement current or some other term.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Bianry identities. In our universe, the divergence of E is rho_e, and the divergence of B is zero. The curl of E is related to B, and the curl of B is related to E and J_e.

But with monopoles, the Bianchi identities change. The Bianchi identity for B is that the curl of B is zero in our universe because ∇·B=0 and the Maxwell equations are derived from that. But with monopoles, that would change.

Wait, the Bianchi identity is dF=0, where F is the field tensor. In our universe, that leads to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t and ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But if ∇·B is not zero, perhaps the Bianchi identity changes, leading to a different equation for E.

Alternatively, maybe when you have monopoles, the Maxwell tensor is modified to include a dual tensor, making the equations symmetric.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach the problem from the options given.

The question is, which of Maxwell's equations are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles. The options are:

A) The one related to the divergence of B.

B) The ones related to the circulation (curl) of E and divergence of B.

C) The ones related to the circulation of B and flux of E.

D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of B.

Wait, option C says circulation (curl) of B and flux of E. Flux of E is Gauss's law, equation 1. So that's ∇·E. I don't think equation 1 changes, because it's about electric charge, not magnetic.

Option D says divergence and curl of B. So equations 2 and 4.

But in our case, equation 2 (div B) changes, and equation 4 would change if the curl of B is affected by magnetic currents.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe equation 4 doesn't change, because it's about the curl of B being related to the electric current and displacement current. So perhaps equation 4 remains the same.

If that's the case, only equation 2 changes. But none of the options say that. Looking back, option A says only the divergence of B changes. So that's possible.

Wait, the options:

A) Only the divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

So if only equation 2 changes (div B), then option A would be the answer. But from what I thought earlier, perhaps equation 3 also changes because it would have a term involving J_m. So if equations 2 and 3 are modified, but none of the options directly match that.

Wait, looking at option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of B (equation 2). So option B suggests that both equations 2 and 3 are different. So if in this universe, both equations 2 and 3 change, then option B would be correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused about whether equation 3 changes. Let me think again. Equation 3 in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, which would have a current J_m, then perhaps equation 3 would have a term involving J_m. Because, in a sense, a magnetic current would be a source for E's curl.

Alternatively, maybe equation 4 would have a term for J_m. Let me think about that. Equation 4 in our universe is:

∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps equation 4 would also include a term like J_m, or perhaps a term involving the time derivative of E in a different way. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: in a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the symmetries of Maxwell's equations are altered. So the two equations that deal with sources (equations 1 and 2) would change. Additionally, the other two equations, which deal with curls, would also change to maintain consistency.

Wait, if equation 2 changes because of the divergence of B, then what about equation 3? Because in our universe, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If you have a time-varying B field and a current, perhaps equation 3 would also need to include a term for the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 changes. So which option points to that?

Option A says only the divergence of B. So if that's the only change, option A would be correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles. According to what I've read before, when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations change. Specifically, the divergence of B becomes non-zero, and the curl of E gains an additional term involving the magnetic current.

So in that case, equations 2 and 3 change. Which would correspond to option B, which says the ones related to the circulation (curl) of E and the divergence of B.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but why would the curl of E change? Because if there are magnetic currents, then the presence of such currents would cause a 'source' for the curl of E. For instance, similar to how a time-varying B field contributes to E's curl in Faraday's law, a magnetic current would add another term.

So, the modified equations would have equation 2 as ∇·B = rho_m and equation 3 as ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m.

Therefore, both equations 2 and 3 are different. So looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of E and the divergence of B. So option B is correct.

In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from our standard understanding. The key changes stem from the presence of magnetic charge density and magnetic current density. Let us analyze the options to determine which equations are altered:

1. **Option A**: "The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field."  
   In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, ∇·B would no longer be zero; it would instead equal the magnetic charge density, ∇·B = ρ_m. Thus, this equation definitely changes.

2. **Option B**: "The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field."  
   The circulation of the electric field, ∇×E, is described by Faraday's law, which in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to include a term involving the magnetic current density, J_m, such as ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m/ε₀. Additionally, as discussed above, the divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, would also change. Therefore, both equations related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field are altered.

3. **Option C**: "The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field."  
   The circulation of the magnetic field, ∇×B, is described by the Ampère-Maxwell law, which in our universe is ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. While the presence of magnetic monopoles might introduce additional terms in this equation, it is not directly affected in the same way as ∇·B or ∇×E. The flux of the electric field, ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀, is unrelated to magnetic monopoles and remains unchanged. Thus, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: "The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field."  
   The divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, changes due to the presence of magnetic monopoles. However, the curl of the magnetic field, ∇×B, is not directly altered in the same way. While ∇×B might gain additional terms involving magnetic currents, this is not the primary or direct change caused by magnetic monopoles. Therefore, this option is misleading.

From the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, as both the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) and the circulation of the electric field (∇×E) are altered in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a different universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, what about the other Maxwell's equations? Let me recall them. Maxwell's equations are four in total:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetic fields)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère-Maxwell law)

So, in our universe, equation 2 is zero because no magnetic monopoles. But in the other scenario, equation 2 would change.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. So equation 2 would be different. Are there any others?

No, equation 1 is about electric charge. Unless magnetic monopoles somehow affect electric fields, but I don't think so. So only equation 2 would change.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says only equation 2. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 2. So that would change.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and divergence of B. Wait, the circulation of E is equation 3. So that's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. Why would that change? I don't see why. Unless in this universe, the presence of magnetic charges affects the relation between E and B. But Faraday's law in our universe just relates the curl of E to the rate of change of B. If B can have sources, would that affect the curl of E? Maybe not. So perhaps equation 3 remains the same.

Wait then, if only equation 2 is changed, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the ones related to divergence and curl of B. Wait, no, equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B. So if equation 2 changes, and equation 4? Hmm, equation 4 is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic currents (like moving monopoles), perhaps that would introduce another term. Oh wait, but in our universe, without monopoles, equation 4 is curl B equals something. If you have magnetic monopoles, you might also have magnetic current density, so the equation would need to account for that. So perhaps equation 4 would also change.

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + something involving J_m?

Wait, I'm not exactly remembering, but I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, the other equations besides equation 2 also get modified. For example, the curl of E would include a term related to the magnetic current or vice versa.

Wait, Faraday's law in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have an extra term. The usual Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if there are magnetic currents, you might have something like ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m. Or maybe J_m is included in another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law gets an extra term for the magnetic current.

Wait, I think that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the four equations become symmetric:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / ε₀
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + (1/c²) ∂E/∂t? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, equation 4 would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, I've heard that to make Maxwell's equations symmetric when magnetic monopoles exist, the equations would include terms for magnetic charge and current in the other equations. So equation 3 would change, and equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, but in the question, the scenario is that Maxwell's equations look different. So which of the four equations are altered?

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. In this other universe, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m. So that's one change.

But are there others? Let me think about the other equations.

Equation 3: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, that would imply that the curl of E is not just the time derivative of B but also includes a term from the magnetic current. So equation 3 would change.

Similarly, equation 4 would involve a term with the magnetic current. So equation 4 would also change.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

In normal Maxwell's equations without monopoles:

Equation 1: electric flux divergence is rho_e / epsilon0.

Equation 2: magnetic flux divergence is zero.

Equation 3: curl of E is minus the time derivative of B.

Equation 4: curl of B is mu0 times J_e plus displacement current.

So with monopoles, equation 2 becomes non-zero.

Now, equation 3: if you have a magnetic current, would it affect the curl of E? Or would the curl of B be affected?

Wait, when you have a magnetic current density J_m (like a current of monopoles moving), it's similar to how electric current J_e affects equation 4. So perhaps equation 3 would get a term involving J_m.

Wait, no, because equation 3 is about E's curl. If you have a magnetic current, that might affect B's time derivative, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe equation 4 would have a term from J_m.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become symmetric. So equation 2: ∇·B = rho_m / mu0.

Equation 3 becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / epsilon0.

Equation 4: ∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + (some term involving J_m? Or perhaps a term involving J_m in the equation for ∇×B.)

Wait, perhaps the Ampère-Maxwell law would have an additional term. Let me think. Without monopoles, equation 4 is:

∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t

If you have magnetic currents, perhaps the equation would also include a term from the magnetic current, but I'm not sure exactly how. Maybe equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. Alternatively, maybe that term would be part of another equation.

Wait, I think that the presence of magnetic monopoles would require two changes: equation 2 becomes non-zero (div B = rho_m) and equation 3 (curl E) gets a term involving J_m, and equation 4 gets a term involving J_m as well. But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach.

In standard Maxwell's equations, the equations are symmetrical except for electric and magnetic aspects. So when you have monopoles, you can make the equations symmetric by adding terms for magnetic charge and current.

So equation 2: div B = rho_m.

Equation 3: curl E = -dB/dt - J_m.

Equation 4: curl B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 dE/dt + J_m'.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which equations are directly affected. The scenario is that the universe allows isolated N and S poles. So equation 2 must change because it's about the divergence of B, which is zero in our world but non-zero here.

But wait, the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. So the options are about which equations are altered.

Looking back at the options, option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 (divergence) and equation 4 (curl) would change. Is that the case?

Wait, equation 4 is the curl of B. Would that change? In our universe, equation 4 includes the displacement current and the electric current. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect equation 4?

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) would change as well. Let me think: equation 3 is about the electric field's curl being related to the time derivative of B. But if there are magnetic currents, would that introduce a term in equation 3?

I'm not entirely sure, but from what I remember, the presence of magnetic monopoles would affect two of Maxwell's equations. In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. If monopoles exist, it's ∇·B = (some term). Also, equation 3, which is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would include a term involving the magnetic current. Because, similar to how equation 4 includes the displacement current, equation 3 would have a current term.

Wait, but equation 3 is about the electric field. So perhaps equation 3 would include a term for magnetic current, and equation 4 would have a term for something else. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same.

Alternatively, maybe the magnetic monopoles affect equation 4 by adding a term involving the magnetic current.

Alternatively, I remember that when you have magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / mu0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m / epsilon0
4. ∇×B = mu0 J_e + mu0 epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_m / (c^2) )

Wait, that's getting a bit more concrete. So equation 3 would now have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current.

So in this scenario, equation 2, equation 3, and equation 4 would change? Or only equation 2 and equation 3?

Wait, no. Equation 4 in our universe doesn't have a term involving J_m. If we have magnetic monopoles, perhaps equation 4 would also get a term for the displacement current or some other term.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Bianry identities. In our universe, the divergence of E is rho_e, and the divergence of B is zero. The curl of E is related to B, and the curl of B is related to E and J_e.

But with monopoles, the Bianchi identities change. The Bianchi identity for B is that the curl of B is zero in our universe because ∇·B=0 and the Maxwell equations are derived from that. But with monopoles, that would change.

Wait, the Bianchi identity is dF=0, where F is the field tensor. In our universe, that leads to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t and ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But if ∇·B is not zero, perhaps the Bianchi identity changes, leading to a different equation for E.

Alternatively, maybe when you have monopoles, the Maxwell tensor is modified to include a dual tensor, making the equations symmetric.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach the problem from the options given.

The question is, which of Maxwell's equations are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles. The options are:

A) The one related to the divergence of B.

B) The ones related to the circulation (curl) of E and divergence of B.

C) The ones related to the circulation of B and flux of E.

D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of B.

Wait, option C says circulation (curl) of B and flux of E. Flux of E is Gauss's law, equation 1. So that's ∇·E. I don't think equation 1 changes, because it's about electric charge, not magnetic.

Option D says divergence and curl of B. So equations 2 and 4.

But in our case, equation 2 (div B) changes, and equation 4 would change if the curl of B is affected by magnetic currents.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe equation 4 doesn't change, because it's about the curl of B being related to the electric current and displacement current. So perhaps equation 4 remains the same.

If that's the case, only equation 2 changes. But none of the options say that. Looking back, option A says only the divergence of B changes. So that's possible.

Wait, the options:

A) Only the divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

So if only equation 2 changes (div B), then option A would be the answer. But from what I thought earlier, perhaps equation 3 also changes because it would have a term involving J_m. So if equations 2 and 3 are modified, but none of the options directly match that.

Wait, looking at option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of B (equation 2). So option B suggests that both equations 2 and 3 are different. So if in this universe, both equations 2 and 3 change, then option B would be correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused about whether equation 3 changes. Let me think again. Equation 3 in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, which would have a current J_m, then perhaps equation 3 would have a term involving J_m. Because, in a sense, a magnetic current would be a source for E's curl.

Alternatively, maybe equation 4 would have a term for J_m. Let me think about that. Equation 4 in our universe is:

∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps equation 4 would also include a term like J_m, or perhaps a term involving the time derivative of E in a different way. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: in a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the symmetries of Maxwell's equations are altered. So the two equations that deal with sources (equations 1 and 2) would change. Additionally, the other two equations, which deal with curls, would also change to maintain consistency.

Wait, if equation 2 changes because of the divergence of B, then what about equation 3? Because in our universe, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If you have a time-varying B field and a current, perhaps equation 3 would also need to include a term for the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps only equation 2 changes. So which option points to that?

Option A says only the divergence of B. So if that's the only change, option A would be correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles. According to what I've read before, when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations change. Specifically, the divergence of B becomes non-zero, and the curl of E gains an additional term involving the magnetic current.

So in that case, equations 2 and 3 change. Which would correspond to option B, which says the ones related to the circulation (curl) of E and the divergence of B.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but why would the curl of E change? Because if there are magnetic currents, then the presence of such currents would cause a 'source' for the curl of E. For instance, similar to how a time-varying B field contributes to E's curl in Faraday's law, a magnetic current would add another term.

So, the modified equations would have equation 2 as ∇·B = rho_m and equation 3 as ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m.

Therefore, both equations 2 and 3 are different. So looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of E and the divergence of B. So option B is correct.


In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from our standard understanding. The key changes stem from the presence of magnetic charge density and magnetic current density. Let us analyze the options to determine which equations are altered:

1. **Option A**: "The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field."  
   In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, ∇·B would no longer be zero; it would instead equal the magnetic charge density, ∇·B = ρ_m. Thus, this equation definitely changes.

2. **Option B**: "The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field."  
   The circulation of the electric field, ∇×E, is described by Faraday's law, which in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to include a term involving the magnetic current density, J_m, such as ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m/ε₀. Additionally, as discussed above, the divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, would also change. Therefore, both equations related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field are altered.

3. **Option C**: "The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field."  
   The circulation of the magnetic field, ∇×B, is described by the Ampère-Maxwell law, which in our universe is ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. While the presence of magnetic monopoles might introduce additional terms in this equation, it is not directly affected in the same way as ∇·B or ∇×E. The flux of the electric field, ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀, is unrelated to magnetic monopoles and remains unchanged. Thus, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: "The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field."  
   The divergence of the magnetic field, ∇·B, changes due to the presence of magnetic monopoles. However, the curl of the magnetic field, ∇×B, is not directly altered in the same way. While ∇×B might gain additional terms involving magnetic currents, this is not the primary or direct change caused by magnetic monopoles. Therefore, this option is misleading.

From the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, as both the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) and the circulation of the electric field (∇×E) are altered in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B
