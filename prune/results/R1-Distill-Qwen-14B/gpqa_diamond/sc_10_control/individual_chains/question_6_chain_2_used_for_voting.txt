Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, a particle in two dimensions with a specific potential. I need to find the energy spectrum. The question gives the potential V(r,θ) as ½ kr² plus 3/2 kr² cos²θ. And the options are different expressions involving n_x, n_y, and other constants.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potentials in two or three dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to separate the equation into radial and angular parts. So maybe the potential can be rewritten in a way that separates r and θ terms. Let me think about that.

The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr². So that's kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) ] . Hmm, alternatively, I can write this as (1/2) kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, maybe I can split this into the sum of two terms which depend on r and θ, but perhaps one is only a function of r and the other only of θ. But wait, in this case, the potential depends on both r and θ, so it's not spherically symmetric. Oh right, because the second term depends on θ, which means it's an anisotropic potential.

Wait, but in two dimensions, the polar coordinates are r and θ. If the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions each depending on r and θ, maybe each part is separable. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates? Because sometimes, in polar coordinates, it's tricky, and converting to Cartesian might make it easier to see separability.

Alternatively, another approach I remember is that when you have a potential like r² in polar coordinates, it's similar to a harmonic oscillator. And when you have terms involving cos²θ, perhaps this relates to a perturbation or another part of the potential. Wait, but in this case, the potential is a sum of two terms, each with r² and some θ dependence.

Let me think about the form. Suppose I write the potential as V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Maybe I can factor out the r² to get V(r,θ)= kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, so that's kr² [ (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Wait, another thought: 1 + 3 cos²θ can be expressed as 1 + cos²θ + 2 cos²θ, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, 3 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 = (3/2) + (3/2) cos(2θ). So then V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) * ( (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ) ) ].

Wait, let me calculate that correctly. Wait, the original expression is (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ. So substituting cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So (3/2) cos²θ = (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = 3/(4) (1 + cos2θ). So the entire expression inside the brackets becomes (1/2) + 3/(4) + 3/(4) cos2θ. Let's compute that: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ]. So V(r,θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of two terms: one is a radial harmonic oscillator, and the other is a potential that depends on cos2θ. Wait, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of two terms, each of which is separable into radial and angular parts. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a potential can sometimes be expressed in terms of the radial and angular components. The radial part involves the usual harmonic oscillator terms, and the angular part depends on the angular momentum. But in this case, the potential is not spherically symmetric, so it's not just a simple harmonic oscillator.

Wait, but another thought: in two dimensions, the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, right? So cos²θ = x²/(r²). So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (x²)/(r²) ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, wait a minute! Because x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ. So substituting that into the potential, the potential becomes V(r,θ)= (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²)/(r^2). Wait, no: Wait, I think I messed up. Let me recast this correctly.

Wait, wait, cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/r². So the term 3/2 kr² cos²θ is equal to (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². Because kr² times (x²/r²) is kx². Oh, wait, so the second term is (3/2)k x². So the entire potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, but in terms of Cartesian coordinates (x and y), that's (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x². Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, the potential becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute that.

So (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Combine like terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². That's (2)k x² + (1/2)k y². So the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah, that's a much simpler form! So now, in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two harmonic oscillators: one along x with frequency related to 2k and another along y with (1/2)k. So perhaps the energy levels can be found by treating each direction separately.

In one dimension, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m) for a potential (1/2) m ω² x². So here, in the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². So the effective 'k' for the x-direction is 2k. And the y-direction has (1/2)k x². Wait no, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so the 'k' is (1/2)k.

Wait, let me get this straight. The potential in x is 2k x². So the potential can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (2k)/m. So ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). Similarly, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2) m ω_y² y², where ω_y² = ( (1/2)k ) / m = k/(2m). So ω_y = sqrt( k/(2m) ).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the potential in x is 2k x², which is like (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2)k y² → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So for the x-direction, each quantum number n_x contributes energy (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, and for y, each n_y contributes (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So the total energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the ω's, E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me compute each part:

First term: 2 sqrt(k/m) is the same as 2 * sqrt(k/m). So (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) * ℏ.

Which is (2n_x + 1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Second term: (n_y + 1/2) * sqrt(k/m) * ℏ.

So adding them together:

E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let's compute that: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the total energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, which option matches this?

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m), which is exactly what I have. So the energy spectrum is option C.

Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes 2k x² + (1/2) k y². That's correct because V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Then, when I converted to Cartesian, I got 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Yes, that's correct. Then, for each direction, I found the angular frequency. For x: ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), for y: ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then the energy contributions from each direction are (n_x +1/2) ℏ ω_x and (n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So, E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 * ℏ sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which simplifies to (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m) → (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So yes, option C is correct.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Step 1: Rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates
The potential is given in polar coordinates, but it is easier to analyze in Cartesian coordinates. Using the relationships \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \), the potential can be rewritten as:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta.
\]
Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the second term becomes:
\[
\frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta = \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]
Thus, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:
\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the potential as two independent harmonic oscillators
The potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \) describes two independent harmonic oscillators:
1. Along the \( x \)-direction: The potential is \( 2kx^2 \), corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).
2. Along the \( y \)-direction: The potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

### Step 3: Determine the energy spectrum
For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:
\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
\]
where \( n \) is the quantum number. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy contribution is:
\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
\]
For the \( y \)-direction, the energy contribution is:
\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
The total energy is the sum of these contributions:
\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The derived energy spectrum matches **Option C**, which states:
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

So the entire expression inside the brackets becomes (1/2) + 3/(4) + 3/(4) cos2θ. Let's compute that: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ]. So V(r,θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of two terms: one is a radial harmonic oscillator, and the other is a potential that depends on cos2θ.

So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (x²)/(r²) ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, wait a minute! Because x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ. So substituting that into the potential, the potential becomes V(r,θ)= (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²)/(r^2). Wait, no: Wait, I think I messed up. Let me recast this correctly.

Wait, wait, cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/r². So the term 3/2 kr² cos²θ is equal to (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². Because kr² times (x²/r²) is kx². Oh, wait, so the second term is (3/2)k x². So the entire potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, but in terms of Cartesian coordinates (x and y), that's (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x². Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, the potential becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute that.

So (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Combine like terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². That's (2)k x² + (1/2)k y². So the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah, that's a much simpler form! So now, in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two harmonic oscillators: one along x with frequency related to 2k and another along y with (1/2)k. So perhaps the energy levels can be found by treating each direction separately.

So the effective 'k' for the x-direction is 2k. And the y-direction has (1/2)k x². Wait no, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so the 'k' is (1/2)k.

Wait, let me get this straight. The potential in x is 2k x². So the potential can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (2k)/m. So ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). Similarly, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2) m ω_y² y², where ω_y² = ( (1/2)k ) / m = k/(2m). So ω_y = sqrt( k/(2m) ).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the potential in x is 2k x², which is like (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

So for the x-direction, each quantum number n_x contributes energy (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, and for y, each n_y contributes (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So the total energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the ω's, E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me compute each part:

First term: 2 sqrt(k/m) is the same as 2 * sqrt(k/m). So (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) * ℏ.

Which is (2n_x + 1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Second term: (n_y + 1/2) * sqrt(k/m) * ℏ.

So adding them together:

E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let's compute that: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the total energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, which option matches this?

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m), which is exactly what I have. So the energy spectrum is option C.

Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes 2k x² + (1/2) k y². That's correct because V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Then, when I converted to Cartesian, I got 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So, E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 * ℏ sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which simplifies to (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m) → (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So yes, option C is correct.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Step 1: Rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates
The potential is given in polar coordinates, but it is easier to analyze in Cartesian coordinates. Using the relationships \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \), the potential can be rewritten as:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta.
\]
Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the second term becomes:
\[
\frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta = \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]
Thus, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:
\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the potential as two independent harmonic oscillators
The potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \) describes two independent harmonic oscillators:
1. Along the \( x \)-direction: The potential is \( 2kx^2 \), corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).
2. Along the \( y \)-direction: The potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

### Step 3: Determine the energy spectrum
For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:
\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
\]
where \( n \) is the quantum number. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy contribution is:
\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
\]
For the \( y \)-direction, the energy contribution is:
\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
The total energy is the sum of these contributions:
\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The derived energy spectrum matches **Option C**, which states:
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Answer: C
