Okay, I'm trying to tackle this question, and honestly, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step. So, let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to study their developmental interactions. The setup involves some molecular biology techniques, specifically using a bicistronic vector with Cre-Lox systems.

First, the receptor is described as a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices (so probably a beta barrel structure, like a G-protein coupled receptor maybe?) with four extracellular helices and three beta sheets forming a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices—so maybe it's a dimeric protein that binds to the receptor?

The vector setup is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under different promoters or regulatory elements. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. 

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, right? Because I remember that Cre recombinase recognizes loxP, and another variant, maybe lox2272 is a mutant that Cre can't act on but requires a different recombinase or maybe acts as a directional site?

So the setup is that in the vector, you have:

[CBA promoter] -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry

And then IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

Wait, no, wait. The vector is bicistronic, so it has two ORFs in the same transcript? Or each under separate promoters? No, bicistronic means one transcript with two ORFs. So the first ORF is ligand under CBA promoter, then after that, the IRES. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF from the same mRNA. But the ligand and receptor are each with their own stop cassettes.

Wait, but in the description, the ligand is at 5', so the mRNA starts with ligand, then after the stop, mCherry. But wait, the stop is in a loxP cassette. So perhaps when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, causing the stop to be excised. So without Cre, the stop is present, so the mCherry would not be expressed because the ligand ORF is terminated early. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed downstream.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are co-expressed but under different regulatory elements.

Wait, the question mentions that the ligand is under CBA promoter. So the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand ORF. Then, after the ligand, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then comes mCherry. Since the stop is in a loxP cassette, Cre would excise it. So when Cre is present (like in Cre-expressing cells), the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript as the ligand. But wait, the way it's written is that the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry. Hmm, maybe it's a fusion protein? Or perhaps the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or maybe it's a separate thing.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins. So for the ligand, the ORF is followed by a stop with loxP sites. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is terminated, and mCherry is not expressed. But when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, the stop is excised, and mCherry is expressed along with the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So Cre might not act on that, unless the Cre variant can recognize lox2272. Wait, I'm not sure. I think lox2272 is a lox variant that Cre can't recombine because it has a different sequence. So maybe another recombinase is needed for that, but in this case, perhaps the Cre used here can't recombine lox2272. Alternatively, maybe the design is that the stop for the receptor-eGFP is under a different lox site, so maybe only one of them is excised.

Wait, the setup is that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So maybe each gene (ligand and receptor) is flanked by lox sites. So when Cre is present, the genes can be conditionally expressed.

Wait, perhaps the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette with loxP. Then mCherry. Then an IRES which drives the receptor's expression. The receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272 and then eGFP.

So when Cre is present (like in the presence of Cre transgene), it will excise the loxP sites, allowing expression of mCherry and perhaps the receptor. But wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor would be expressed as a separate ORF from the same mRNA, thanks to the IRES.

Wait, but the vector is probably designed so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry (since the stop is in between) and the receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP (since the stop is in between). But that's if the stop is between the ORF and the fluorescent protein.

Wait, no. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry. But that would require that the stop is after mCherry. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the design is that the ligand and mCherry are under the same transcriptional unit, but the stop cassette is in between. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is expressed, followed by a stop, then mCherry. But if the stop is not removed, transcription might terminate early, so mCherry isn't expressed. When Cre excises the stop, the ligand is expressed, and then mCherry is expressed as a separate ORF (but how? Because it's a single mRNA). Wait, no, because in a bicistronic construct, the second ORF is after an IRES.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, then a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it removes the loxP stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand ORF? Or perhaps it allows the second ORF to be expressed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP. Because the stops are in between. But when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as separate proteins, and same for receptor and eGFP.

But the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So, the CBA promoter is for the ligand, and the IRES is before the receptor. So the same mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then IRES, then receptor ORF, then eGFP.

But there are stop cassettes between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, maybe the mCherry and eGFP are separate; ligand is under CBA, followed by a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor is under another promoter? No, the setup says the ligand is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is IRES. So probably, the mRNA is CBA-driven, starting with ligand, then IRES, then receptor.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the vector design. Let's move on to the experiment.

They transfected the vector into primary astrocyte culture. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and ran a Western blot. The total proteins show a signal proportional to actin loading, so that's a control. After plasmid transfection, they didn't see any eGFP signal (from the receptor), but I'm not sure about the mCherry.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, which includes astrocytes, perhaps.

After breeding, they look at the offspring under a confocal microscope for green signal (eGFP). They didn't see any green. What's the issue?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship: meaning they act on different cells. But if the proteins are expressed in the same cells, then autocrine signaling would be possible. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. Maybe because the receptor isn't being expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi: issues with protein trafficking. Like, the receptor isn't being transported to the cell surface, so eGFP isn't visible. But why only the receptor? Because in the vector, both ligand and receptor would be under the same construct. But the Western blot result: they didn't test for eGFP on the blot? Or did they?

Wait, the question says after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they did Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the eGFP and mCherry are used as tags. Or maybe the proteins of interest (ligand and receptor) are overexpressed and the antibodies are against those.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but let's proceed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. So, without the enhancer, the promoters aren't active. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. So if the promoter isn't working, perhaps neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the question is about the eGFP, so maybe the receptor isn't being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed (if any), the receptor and eGFP are on the same reading frame, so they're expressed as a fusion protein. But that would cause the eGFP to be attached to the receptor. In that case, the eGFP would still be produced, but perhaps as a fusion. But the Western blot wouldn't detect eGFP unless the antibody is against eGFP. Wait, but in the experiment, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct includes eGFP, then the antibody against eGFP would detect it. But if the eGFP is not in frame, perhaps it's not being translated, so the Western blot wouldn't show it.

Alternatively, if the stop is present, then the receptor isn't being expressed, and eGFP isn't either. Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector with IRES, so the receptor should be expressed as a separate ORF. Hmm.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA promoter, then stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

Without Cre, the stop after ligand would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed, regardless of the stop in front of mCherry. Wait, because the IRES is after the ligand, so the mRNA would have the ligand, then after the stop, the IRES, then receptor.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the first ORF (ligand), allowing the ribosome to reinitiate and translate the receptor ORF, regardless of the stop after ligand. So in that case, the receptor would be expressed as a separate protein, possibly with eGFP.

But the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP is lox2272. If Cre can't act on that, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor would be expressed without eGFP.

But in the question, the eGFP isn't observed in the offspring, using SOX10-Cre. So perhaps the Cre isn't able to excise the stop after receptor, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the idea is that Cre is necessary to remove the stops so that both mCherry and eGFP are expressed in the same cells as the ligand and receptor.

But the problem is that in the mouse model, when they crossed it to SOX10-Cre, they expected the Cre to excise the stops, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP, but they don't see eGFP.

So why is eGFP not being expressed?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF fuses with eGFP's, but in a way that's out of frame, so eGFP isn't translated.

Alternatively, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but if they are using antibodies to detect eGFP, maybe it's intracellular. But the question is about visualization under a confocal microscope, which is live or fixed cells. If the GFP is retained in the Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce in the cell.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the construct lacks an enhancer, the CBA promoter may not function. But CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps it's constitutive. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe it's not being expressed in the right cells.

Wait, the vector is under CBA for ligand, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So ligand should be expressed wherever the vector is present. The receptor is under IRES, which I think is a way to have two proteins expressed from the same mRNA. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor may not be expressed.

But wait, the presence of IRES allows the ribosome to reinitiate translation after the first ORF, so the receptor should be expressed. Unless the IRES isn't working. But the question is about eGFP expression.

Another angle: the vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a tissue-specific Cre, the recombination would happen in neural crest-derived cells, leading to removal of the stop cassettes and expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But in the experiment, they didn't see green (eGFP) in the offspring. So why?

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is followed directly by eGFP, but if they're not in frame, eGFP isn't expressed as a separate protein. Thus, the Western blot wouldn't detect eGFP. But I'm not sure if the Western blot was done for eGFP or the receptor. The question says the Western blot was used to test construct expression, using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, then the blot wouldn't show a band for eGFP, but maybe the receptor would show up if it's expressed.

But in the mouse experiment, they're looking for GFP fluorescence. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, perhaps because the stop wasn't removed or because the eGFP isn't in frame, then no signal.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so it's not expressed. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF but out of frame. Thus, eGFP isn't produced as a separate protein. So the Western blot would detect the receptor, but the eGFP wouldn't show up.

But the question is why the mouse doesn't show eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't properly expressed, either because it's not in frame or because the stop isn't excised.

Wait, in the vector, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. If Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. But if the vector is designed to have both stop cassettes (ligand and receptor) flanked by loxP and lox2272, then only the loxP stop would be excised by Cre. The lox2272 would require a different recombinase, perhaps, which isn't present. So the eGFP's stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the loxP sites are for the ligand's stop, and lox2272 for the receptor's. So in the presence of Cre, only the ligand's stop is removed (because Cre acts on loxP), allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't acted upon, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP signal.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector with both ORFs. The ligand's stop is loxP, so Cre would remove it, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, only mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP. Thus, the confocal would show red (mCherry) but not green (eGFP). But the question says they don't see green, which is expected if the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed because Cre can't act on it. So the eGFP is still behind a stop cassette. So the answer would be that the stop isn't removed, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But the options don't directly state that. Let's look again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the ORFs are not correctly aligned, so eGFP isn't produced. But if the stop isn't removed, then this isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Maybe the eGFP is synthesized but not transported to the cell surface. But if the protein is intracellular, the confocal might still pick up the fluorescence. Unless it's retained in the ER or Golgi.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another angle: the vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But if the IRES isn't working, the receptor may not be expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the question is about the mouse model. They made the mouse homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is active in neural crest cells. Thus, the stops should be removed, allowing eGFP expression.

But the mice don't show eGFP. So maybe the stop wasn't removed because the lox sites are in the wrong configuration. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't in frame.

Wait, the lox sites are loxP and lox2272. I think Cre can only act on loxP sites. lox2272 is a variant that Cre doesn't recombine, unless it's a mutated lox site that requires a different enzyme. So in the vector, the ligand has a loxP stop, which Cre can remove. The receptor has a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't remove. So in the mouse, when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the mouse would show mCherry expression but not eGFP.

But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can recognize. So the eGFP remains under a stop cassette, thus not expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the receptor isn't in frame. So option D is about the receptor and eGFP not being in frame. Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D) the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be translated, so no fluorescence. But why would that be the case?

Another possibility: the vector's design. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, meaning that in the absence of Cre, mCherry is not expressed because the stop is in between. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, so mCherry can be expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a stop in between. But if the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't remove, then the eGFP would not be expressed regardless of Cre.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the vector is in such a way that without Cre, the eGFP is not expressed. But with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry. But the eGFP is still under a stop that Cre can't remove, so it isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the Cre is introduced, so why isn't the eGFP expressed? Because the stop for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can act on. So the eGFP's stop isn't removed, so it's not expressed.

In that case, the answer would be that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. The options are A to D as given.

Looking back at the options:

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the ORF would read through into eGFP but not produce a proper eGFP protein. So eGFP isn't made. Thus, in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Alternatively, if the stop is present, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP is out of frame, then eGFP isn't produced.

In the question, after the lox-Cre recombination, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the eGFP isn't properly in frame after the stop is removed. But if the stop wasn't removed, then eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. The receptor is expressed via an IRES, so the same mRNA allows multiple ORFs. So the presence of the stop after the receptor would prevent eGFP from being expressed. So for eGFP to be expressed, the stop after the receptor must be removed.

But if the stop is flanked by lox2272, and Cre can't remove it, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can act on.

But the options don't present that. The only option related is D, which is about the reading frame.

Another angle: the vector's design. Perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, leading to a fusion protein. But if eGFP is in a different frame, it won't be translated.

Wait, if the eGFP is in the same frame, then perhaps the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP. So the eGFP would be part of the same protein as the receptor. But that would mean that the eGFP is expressed, but perhaps as a fusion.

But if the eGFP is not in the same frame, then no eGFP protein is made. So in this case, the eGFP's ORF is not in frame, so it isn't translated. Thus, no eGFP expression.

So the answer would be D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed as a separate protein.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason the eGFP isn't observed is that the eGFP and receptor are not in frame. Hence, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette with loxP sites, and fused to mCherry. The receptor is expressed via an IRES element, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272 sites, and fused to eGFP. The vector is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre recombinase in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on why eGFP (linked to the receptor) is not expressed. Since the issue is about receptor expression, this option is irrelevant to the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were trafficking improperly, eGFP might still be detected intracellularly. Additionally, the absence of eGFP fluorescence could also be due to the stop cassette remaining intact, preventing its expression. This option does not fully explain the lack of eGFP expression.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. While an enhancer could influence tissue-specific expression, the question does not indicate any issues with the promoter or enhancer. Furthermore, the focus is on eGFP expression, not receptor expression itself. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette and eGFP. If the stop cassette is not excised (e.g., due to lox2272 not being recognized by Cre), eGFP would not be expressed. Additionally, if the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame relative to the receptor, it would not be translated as a separate protein. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is absent, making this the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of eGFP fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing the expression of eGFP as a separate protein.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this question, and honestly, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step. So, let's see what the question is about.

I think lox2272 is a lox variant that Cre can't recombine because it has a different sequence. So maybe another recombinase is needed for that, but in this case, perhaps the Cre used here can't recombine lox2272. Alternatively, maybe the design is that the stop for the receptor-eGFP is under a different lox site, so maybe only one of them is excised.

Wait, the setup is that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So maybe each gene (ligand and receptor) is flanked by lox sites. So when Cre is present, the genes can be conditionally expressed.

Wait, no, because in a bicistronic construct, the second ORF is after an IRES.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, then a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it removes the loxP stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand ORF? Or perhaps it allows the second ORF to be expressed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP. Because the stops are in between. But when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as separate proteins, and same for receptor and eGFP.

But the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So, the CBA promoter is for the ligand, and the IRES is before the receptor. So the same mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then IRES, then receptor ORF, then eGFP.

But there are stop cassettes between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, maybe the mCherry and eGFP are separate; ligand is under CBA, followed by a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor is under another promoter? No, the setup says the ligand is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is IRES. So probably, the mRNA is CBA-driven, starting with ligand, then IRES, then receptor.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the vector design. Let's move on to the experiment.

They transfected the vector into primary astrocyte culture. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and ran a Western blot. The total proteins show a signal proportional to actin loading, so that's a control. After plasmid transfection, they didn't see any eGFP signal (from the receptor), but I'm not sure about the mCherry.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, which includes astrocytes, perhaps.

After breeding, they look at the offspring under a confocal microscope for green signal (eGFP). They didn't see any green. What's the issue?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship: meaning they act on different cells. But if the proteins are expressed in the same cells, then autocrine signaling would be possible. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. Maybe because the receptor isn't being expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi: issues with protein trafficking. Like, the receptor isn't being transported to the cell surface, so eGFP isn't visible. But why only the receptor? Because in the vector, both ligand and receptor would be under the same construct. But the Western blot result: they didn't test for eGFP on the blot? Or did they?

Wait, the question says after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they did Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the eGFP and mCherry are used as tags. Or maybe the proteins of interest (ligand and receptor) are overexpressed and the antibodies are against those.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but let's proceed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. So, without the enhancer, the promoters aren't active. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. So if the promoter isn't working, perhaps neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the question is about the eGFP, so maybe the receptor isn't being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed (if any), the receptor and eGFP are on the same reading frame, so they're expressed as a fusion protein. But that would cause the eGFP to be attached to the receptor. In that case, the eGFP would still be produced, but perhaps as a fusion. But the Western blot wouldn't detect eGFP unless the antibody is against eGFP. Wait, but in the experiment, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct includes eGFP, then the antibody against eGFP would detect it. But if the eGFP is not in frame, perhaps it's not being translated, so the Western blot wouldn't show it.

Alternatively, if the stop is present, then the receptor isn't being expressed, and eGFP isn't either. Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector with IRES, so the receptor should be expressed as a separate ORF. Hmm.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA promoter, then stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

Without Cre, the stop after ligand would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed, regardless of the stop in front of mCherry. Wait, because the IRES is after the ligand, so the mRNA would have the ligand, then after the stop, the IRES, then receptor.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the first ORF (ligand), allowing the ribosome to reinitiate and translate the receptor ORF, regardless of the stop after ligand. So in that case, the receptor would be expressed as a separate protein, possibly with eGFP.

But the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP is lox2272. If Cre can't act on that, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor would be expressed without eGFP.

But in the question, the eGFP isn't observed in the offspring, using SOX10-Cre. So perhaps the Cre isn't able to excise the stop after receptor, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the idea is that Cre is necessary to remove the stops so that both mCherry and eGFP are expressed in the same cells as the ligand and receptor.

But the problem is that in the mouse model, when they crossed it to SOX10-Cre, they expected the Cre to excise the stops, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP, but they don't see eGFP.

So why is eGFP not being expressed?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF fuses with eGFP's, but in a way that's out of frame, so eGFP isn't translated.

Alternatively, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but if they are using antibodies to detect eGFP, maybe it's intracellular. But the question is about visualization under a confocal microscope, which is live or fixed cells. If the GFP is retained in the Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce in the cell.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the construct lacks an enhancer, the CBA promoter may not function. But CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps it's constitutive. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe it's not being expressed in the right cells.

Wait, the vector is under CBA for ligand, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So ligand should be expressed wherever the vector is present. The receptor is under IRES, which I think is a way to have two proteins expressed from the same mRNA. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor may not be expressed.

But wait, the presence of IRES allows the ribosome to reinitiate translation after the first ORF, so the receptor should be expressed. Unless the IRES isn't working. But the question is about eGFP expression.

Another angle: the vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a tissue-specific Cre, the recombination would happen in neural crest-derived cells, leading to removal of the stop cassettes and expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But in the experiment, they didn't see green (eGFP) in the offspring. So why?

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is followed directly by eGFP, but if they're not in frame, eGFP isn't expressed as a separate protein. Thus, the Western blot wouldn't detect eGFP. But I'm not sure if the Western blot was done for eGFP or the receptor. The question says the Western blot was used to test construct expression, using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, then the blot wouldn't show a band for eGFP, but maybe the receptor would show up if it's expressed.

But in the mouse experiment, they're looking for GFP fluorescence. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, perhaps because the stop wasn't removed or because the eGFP isn't in frame, then no signal.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so it's not expressed. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF but out of frame. Thus, eGFP isn't produced as a separate protein. So the Western blot would detect the receptor, but the eGFP wouldn't show up.

But the question is why the mouse doesn't show eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't properly expressed, either because it's not in frame or because the stop isn't excised.

Wait, in the vector, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. If Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. But if the vector is designed to have both stop cassettes (ligand and receptor) flanked by loxP and lox2272, then only the loxP stop would be excised by Cre. The lox2272 would require a different recombinase, perhaps, which isn't present. So the eGFP's stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the loxP sites are for the ligand's stop, and lox2272 for the receptor's. So in the presence of Cre, only the ligand's stop is removed (because Cre acts on loxP), allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't acted upon, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP signal.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector with both ORFs. The ligand's stop is loxP, so Cre would remove it, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, only mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP. Thus, the confocal would show red (mCherry) but not green (eGFP). But the question says they don't see green, which is expected if the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed because Cre can't act on it. So the eGFP is still behind a stop cassette. So the answer would be that the stop isn't removed, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But the options don't directly state that. Let's look again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the ORFs are not correctly aligned, so eGFP isn't produced. But if the stop isn't removed, then this isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Maybe the eGFP is synthesized but not transported to the cell surface. But if the protein is intracellular, the confocal might still pick up the fluorescence. Unless it's retained in the ER or Golgi.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another angle: the vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But if the IRES isn't working, the receptor may not be expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the question is about the mouse model. They made the mouse homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is active in neural crest cells. Thus, the stops should be removed, allowing eGFP expression.

But the mice don't show eGFP. So maybe the stop wasn't removed because the lox sites are in the wrong configuration. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't in frame.

Wait, the lox sites are loxP and lox2272. I think Cre can only act on loxP sites. lox2272 is a variant that Cre doesn't recombine, unless it's a mutated lox site that requires a different enzyme. So in the vector, the ligand has a loxP stop, which Cre can remove. The receptor has a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't remove. So in the mouse, when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the mouse would show mCherry expression but not eGFP.

But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can recognize. So the eGFP remains under a stop cassette, thus not expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the receptor isn't in frame. So option D is about the receptor and eGFP not being in frame. Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D) the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be translated, so no fluorescence. But why would that be the case?

Another possibility: the vector's design. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, meaning that in the absence of Cre, mCherry is not expressed because the stop is in between. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, so mCherry can be expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a stop in between. But if the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't remove, then the eGFP would not be expressed regardless of Cre.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the vector is in such a way that without Cre, the eGFP is not expressed. But with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry. But the eGFP is still under a stop that Cre can't remove, so it isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the Cre is introduced, so why isn't the eGFP expressed? Because the stop for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can act on. So the eGFP's stop isn't removed, so it's not expressed.

In that case, the answer would be that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. The options are A to D as given.

Looking back at the options:

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the ORF would read through into eGFP but not produce a proper eGFP protein. So eGFP isn't made. Thus, in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Alternatively, if the stop is present, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP is out of frame, then eGFP isn't produced.

In the question, after the lox-Cre recombination, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the eGFP isn't properly in frame after the stop is removed. But if the stop wasn't removed, then eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. The receptor is expressed via an IRES, so the same mRNA allows multiple ORFs. So the presence of the stop after the receptor would prevent eGFP from being expressed. So for eGFP to be expressed, the stop after the receptor must be removed.

But if the stop is flanked by lox2272, and Cre can't remove it, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop for eGFP isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can act on.

But the options don't present that. The only option related is D, which is about the reading frame.

Another angle: the vector's design. Perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, leading to a fusion protein. But if eGFP is in a different frame, it won't be translated.

Wait, if the eGFP is in the same frame, then perhaps the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP. So the eGFP would be part of the same protein as the receptor. But that would mean that the eGFP is expressed, but perhaps as a fusion.

But if the eGFP is not in the same frame, then no eGFP protein is made. So in this case, the eGFP's ORF is not in frame, so it isn't translated. Thus, no eGFP expression.

So the answer would be D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed as a separate protein.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason the eGFP isn't observed is that the eGFP and receptor are not in frame. Hence, option D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette with loxP sites, and fused to mCherry. The receptor is expressed via an IRES element, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272 sites, and fused to eGFP. The vector is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre recombinase in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on why eGFP (linked to the receptor) is not expressed. Since the issue is about receptor expression, this option is irrelevant to the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were trafficking improperly, eGFP might still be detected intracellularly. Additionally, the absence of eGFP fluorescence could also be due to the stop cassette remaining intact, preventing its expression. This option does not fully explain the lack of eGFP expression.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. While an enhancer could influence tissue-specific expression, the question does not indicate any issues with the promoter or enhancer. Furthermore, the focus is on eGFP expression, not receptor expression itself. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette and eGFP. If the stop cassette is not excised (e.g., due to lox2272 not being recognized by Cre), eGFP would not be expressed. Additionally, if the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame relative to the receptor, it would not be translated as a separate protein. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is absent, making this the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of eGFP fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing the expression of eGFP as a separate protein.
