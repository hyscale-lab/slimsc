Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The TLC results show the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out what the products could be from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, specifically an acid-catalyzed addition. The mechanism is probably via the bromonium ion intermediate. So, the starting material has a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether part is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is a benzene ring with an oxygen connected to a butenyl group. Let me draw that mentally: the oxygen is attached to the first carbon of a butenyl chain, which is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is more like:

The butenyl group is CH2CH2-... Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3, so that would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but the butenyl is from the first carbon. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, the double bond starts at position 3. Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene. But wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl has four carbons. So carbon 1 is the point of attachment.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. No, wait, but the butenyl is 3-en, which is double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, but buten-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because in a four-carbon chain, the double bond between C3 and C4 would be at the end. Wait, maybe I should visualize it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the first carbon is attached to the O, then the next two are CH2, and then a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, but then the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, no, that's not possible because but-3-en-1-yl would be: the first carbon is connected to the oxygen, then the second and third carbons have a double bond. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-phenyl? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that the substituents are on the second and third carbons. Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is attached via the first carbon. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (but that's outside the four-carbon chain? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons, so the double bond can be between 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4.

Wait, but for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because that would be the end. So perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. But butenyl has four carbons. So 3-en would mean the double bond starts on C3, but that would be the fourth carbon in a four-carbon chain. That doesn't make sense because you can't have a double bond beyond the end. So perhaps I made a mistake. Another possibility: maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a 2-en. So but-3-en-1-yl would actually be but-2-en-1-yl, right? Because the higher number is preferred for the double bond position. Hmm, maybe that's a confusion point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2-O-phenyl? No, wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is:

The first carbon (attached to oxygen) is CH2, the second carbon is CH(CH3)2, and then the third and fourth have a double bond. Wait, but that would be but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, but that would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4, which is between the third and fourth carbons, giving CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2? That doesn't seem possible because that would require the third and fourth carbons to be adjacent. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's the same as CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, no. Wait, but if the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, then the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, because that's five carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl is four carbons, with substituents on C2 (two methyl groups), and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But wait, that would be a single bond. Oh wait, no, because it's but-3-en-1-yl, which implies a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's only possible if it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH. But that doesn't fit the substituents. Hmm, maybe the structure is:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the substituent is a butenyl group (four carbons) with a double bond starting at C3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that can't be right because the double bond is at C3, which would require the structure to be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth. So, perhaps O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 is a single bond, but for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't fit because the double bond would be at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction. The starting material is an allyl ether. When an allyl ether reacts with HBr, what happens? I think allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening or addition. Alternatively, the allyl group could undergo addition with HBr.

Wait, but when an allyl group is present, especially in an ether, the reaction with HBr can proceed via acid-catalyzed addition. In this case, the butenyl group is part of an ether, so the reaction would be similar to the addition of HBr to an allyl ether.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not the case here; the starting material isn't an epoxide.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an addition across the double bond. For an allyl ether, adding HBr would proceed via a similar mechanism to the addition to an alkene. So the HBr adds to the double bond, making a di-substituted product.

Wait, but when HBr adds to an alkene, it typically does so via the bromonium ion formation. So in an allyl ether, the addition of HBr would occur at the double bond, leading to a brominated alkyl group.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction here is more about the possible addition or substitution. Let me think: the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. The double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, because the double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? That can't be because the butenyl group is four carbons in total. So the structure must be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, but that would make it but-2-en-1-yl, not but-3-en-1-yl.

I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The reaction is with HBr, which is a strong acid and a source of Br-. The starting material is an ether with an allyl group. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, leading to a carbocation and subsequent bromide attack.

Wait, but that's more typical for epoxides or certain other ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the allyl ether undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the bromide replaces the oxygen. But that's more common in good leaving groups, like tosylates or something. Oxygens in ethers are not typically good leaving groups without some activation.

Wait, but another possibility: the HBr might add to the double bond in the allyl group. So the addition of HBr to the double bond would lead to bromide addition. Let me think about the mechanism. The HBr would protonate the double bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation at the more substituted position. Then, the bromide ion would attack.

In the given case, the butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would require a four-carbon chain with a double bond between the last two carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it: CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that would be beyond the chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the butenyl group as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH. But that doesn't make sense for four carbons. I'm getting stuck, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two products, which would imply that the starting material can add HBr in two different positions, leading to different products. But in an allyl system, the addition of HBr would typically proceed in a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed. So perhaps the major product is the one where the bromide adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but if there's a possibility of two different products, perhaps the starting material has two different sites where the addition can occur or some rearrangement happens.

Wait, alternatively, the reaction could involve the allyl group opening via HBr addition, leading to a substituted bromide. But let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. Hmm, these are phenols with substituents. But how would that form? If the ether group (O-) is replaced by an -OH (phenol) and the rest is a butyl group. But that would require the oxygen to be replaced by HBr, which is substitution. But ethers are generally not reactive enough for that without some activation. Unless there's some acid catalysis leading to a good leaving group. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmmm. So one product is a brominated butoxy benzene, and the other is a butenyl group with a different substitution. Maybe the HBr adds to the double bond, leading to a brominated product, but perhaps with a shift or rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a bromide at the end, and another product is from a different mode of addition.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look more like possible products of some kind of ring-opening or cyclization. For example, chromane is a bicyclic structure, maybe formed from a six-membered ring with a bridge. Alternatively, benzofuran is a fused ring, which might form if the ether undergoes some kind of cyclization. But I'm not sure how HBr would lead to that. Maybe if the addition generates a carbocation that undergoes intramolecular attack, forming a ring. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both are brominated butoxy derivatives, but the bromine is at different positions. That suggests that HBr adds to the double bond in different positions, leading to different substituents. But in an allyl system, the addition of HBr would typically lead to a specific regiochemistry, so why would there be two different brominated products?

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a di-substituted alkene, which allows for two different sites of addition. Alternatively, maybe the bromide can add to either end of the double bond, leading to different products.

Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the structure is benzene ring - O - CH2 - C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2, but with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, but-3-en-1-yl implies the double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the butenyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between C3 and C4, which is the end of the chain. So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 → but with a double bond between the third and fourth, so Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 becomes Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is:

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph

Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)2-O-Ph? No, because the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-Ph? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would make the structure CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, which is the end, so it would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 → but that's a single bond, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't make sense because there's no double bond. I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the possible products and which options match the reaction.

The reaction is between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and HBr. So the molecule has a benzene ring attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a butenyl group with 2,2-dimethyl substituents.

When HBr is added, it can add across the double bond. The addition of HBr to an allyl group would typically result in anti addition, leading to a bromide at the end. But if the starting material's double bond is in a particular position, the addition could lead to different products.

Looking at the options:

Option D suggests two different brominated products, each with bromine at position 3 and 4. That would imply that the addition of Br occurs at two different positions on the butenyl group.

Alternatively, option B suggests one brominated product and another product with a different structure. That might imply that the starting material undergoes both addition and some kind of rearrangement or isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: the HBr could add to the double bond in two different ways, leading to different regiochemical outcomes. But in allylic systems, the addition tends to be more about the more substituted position due to carbocation stability.

Wait, but if the starting material's double bond is in a position that allows for different regioselectivity upon addition, then two products could form. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of different carbocations, which could then capture Br- in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some kind of ring formation, such as a bicyclic structure, as in option C. But how would HBr lead to that?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, the starting material isn't an epoxide; it's an allyl ether. So that's not applicable.

Wait, thinking again about the possible structures:

If the starting material's butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which I think is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right because that would be a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because that would make the last two CH2 groups have a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. No, that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should accept that I'm not getting the structure correctly and proceed based on the reaction possibilities.

If the reaction adds HBr to the double bond, the major product would be the bromide added to the more substituted carbon. Since the starting material is a butenyl group with 2,2-dimethyl substitution, the more substituted end would be the one with the substituents. So maybe the bromide adds to the end opposite the substituents, leading to a single product. But the question says two new spots appeared on TLC, implying two products.

So perhaps there's another possibility. Maybe the reaction isn't just addition but also involves some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility is that the HBr abstracts a proton from the butenyl group, leading to a carbocation, and then the bromide adds. But depending on where the carbocation forms, different products could form.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a possibility for two different addition sites, leading to two products.

But without the correct structure, it's hard to see. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material undergoes acid-catalyzed cleavage, leading to a phenol and another product.

Wait, looking back at option A, the products are phenols with substituents. So if the ether group (O-) is replaced by an -OH (phenol group), and the butenyl group is simply a substituent attached, that could be possible. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the O- group is replaced by Br, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage where the O breaks, and the HBr adds in a way that forms two products: one a phenol and another a bromide.

Wait, let me think. If the starting material is an ether, and HBr adds in such a way that the oxygen is replaced by Br, but that's more of an SN2 reaction, which is unlikely here. Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then leaves as H2O, forming a carbocation which then captures Br-.

But in that case, the phenol would form as one product, and the bromide would form another. Wait, but the starting material is an ether, so the O is connected to a butenyl group. If the O breaks, then the phenol would be Ph-OH, and the butenyl group would have a Br. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the HBr adds to the double bond, breaking the double bond and adding H and Br. Then, the product would be a bromide.

Wait, but if the addition is at the end, the Br would be on the fourth carbon, making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But where else could Br add? Maybe if the addition occurs at the other end, but that's only possible if the double bond is in a position that allows for two different additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a bromide on the third carbon, making (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But how?

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph. In that case, adding HBr could add to either end. So adding H to C2 and Br to C3 would give a product where Br is on C3. Alternatively, adding H to C3 and Br to C2 would give Br on C2. But wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph.

In that scenario, adding HBr could add across the double bond, leading to either:

1. Br on C2 (if H adds to C3), making (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Or

2. Br on C3 (if H adds to C2), making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Wait, but butoxy has four carbons. Let me count:

If the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, adding HBr across the double bond (between C2 and C3) would produce:

Either H adds to C2 and Br to C3, giving CH2Br-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, but that's incorrect because the addition would be anti, so the structure would actually be CH2Br-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, but I'm not sure about the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the more substituted carbocation, leading to Br adding to the less substituted position. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, the possible products in option D are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both have bromine on the butoxy group, but at different positions.

If the starting material's butenyl group is such that adding HBr can lead to bromine on either the third or fourth carbon, then option D would be the correct answer.

But then why would there be two products? Because the addition could have occurred at two different positions, perhaps due to different regiochemistry or because the starting material has some stereochemistry that allows for different additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has some possibility for different sites of addition, such as if the double bond is in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing for addition to either end, leading to bromide on C3 or C4.

But in that case, the reaction would form two products: one with Br on C3 and one on C4.

Looking at option D, the two products are 4-bromo and 3-bromo, which would fit.

So based on that, option D seems plausible.

Wait, but let me think again. If the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, then the butenyl group is at position 3. So the double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Or perhaps:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because that's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would make it Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond, so I'm clearly missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not matching the substituent description.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, meaning it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond in that position.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed based on the reaction possibilities.

If the addition of HBr leads to two different products, then the correct option would be the one where two brominated products are formed, which is option D.

Alternatively, option B suggests one product is a brominated butoxy benzene and another is a different butenyl group. That might involve some kind of rearrangement, like a hydride shift, leading to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, let me think: if the addition of HBr forms a carbocation, perhaps a hydride shift occurs to form a more stable carbocation. For example, if the initial carbocation is at C3 and it shifts to C4, leading to different products.

But in that case, you might get a single product, not two. Unless there are multiple sites for the carbocation to form, leading to different products.

Another possibility is that the starting material is such that the double bond can add HBr in two different ways, leading to two different products.

In any case, looking at the options, option D presents two different brominated products, which aligns with the idea that HBr adds to the double bond in two different positions, leading to two products.

So the correct answer is likely option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the butenyl group is attached to a benzene ring via an oxygen atom. The double bond in the butenyl group is between carbons 3 and 4, and the substituents are two methyl groups on carbon 2. When HBr reacts with such a system, it typically adds across the double bond via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, forming a brominated product.

The reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion. Depending on the regioselectivity of the addition, bromine can add to either the third or fourth carbon of the butenyl group, leading to two different products. This explains the presence of two new spots on the TLC plate, indicating the formation of two distinct products.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Suggests the formation of two phenol derivatives. This would require the ether oxygen to be replaced by a hydroxyl group, which is unlikely under the given reaction conditions. Ethers are generally not reactive enough for such substitution without specific activation.

2. **Option B**: Proposes one brominated product and another with a different substitution pattern. This could involve rearrangement or isomerization, but it does not align well with the expected regioselectivity of HBr addition to the double bond.

3. **Option C**: Suggests the formation of cyclic products (chromane and benzofuran derivatives). These structures would require intramolecular cyclization, which is not supported by the reaction conditions or the starting material.

4. **Option D**: Indicates the formation of two brominated products, with bromine at positions 3 and 4 of the butenyl group. This aligns with the expected regioselectivity of HBr addition, where bromine can add to either the third or fourth carbon, depending on the carbocation stability during the reaction.

Given the reaction mechanism and the expected products, **Option D** is the most plausible, as it accounts for the formation of two distinct brominated products due to addition at different positions on the butenyl group.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The TLC results show the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out what the products could be from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, specifically an acid-catalyzed addition. The mechanism is probably via the bromonium ion intermediate. So, the starting material has a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether part is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is a benzene ring with an oxygen connected to a butenyl group. Let me draw that mentally: the oxygen is attached to the first carbon of a butenyl chain, which is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is more like:

The butenyl group is CH2CH2-... Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3, so that would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but the butenyl is from the first carbon. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, the double bond starts at position 3. Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene. But wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl has four carbons. So carbon 1 is the point of attachment.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. No, wait, but the butenyl is 3-en, which is double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, but buten-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because in a four-carbon chain, the double bond between C3 and C4 would be at the end. Wait, maybe I should visualize it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the first carbon is attached to the O, then the next two are CH2, and then a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, but then the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, no, that's not possible because but-3-en-1-yl would be: the first carbon is connected to the oxygen, then the second and third carbons have a double bond. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-phenyl? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that the substituents are on the second and third carbons. Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is attached via the first carbon. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (but that's outside the four-carbon chain? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons, so the double bond can be between 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4.

Wait, but for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because that would be the end. So perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. But butenyl has four carbons. So 3-en would mean the double bond starts on C3, but that would be the fourth carbon in a four-carbon chain. That doesn't make sense because you can't have a double bond beyond the end. So perhaps I made a mistake. Another possibility: maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a 2-en. So but-3-en-1-yl would actually be but-2-en-1-yl, right? Because the higher number is preferred for the double bond position. Hmm, maybe that's a confusion point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2-O-phenyl? No, wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is:

The first carbon (attached to oxygen) is CH2, the second carbon is CH(CH3)2, and then the third and fourth have a double bond. Wait, but that would be but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, but that would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4, which is between the third and fourth carbons, giving CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2? That doesn't seem possible because that would require the third and fourth carbons to be adjacent. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's the same as CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, no. Wait, but if the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, then the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, because that's five carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl is four carbons, with substituents on C2 (two methyl groups), and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But wait, that would be a single bond. Oh wait, no, because it's but-3-en-1-yl, which implies a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's only possible if it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH. But that doesn't fit the substituents. Hmm, maybe the structure is:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the substituent is a butenyl group (four carbons) with a double bond starting at C3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that can't be right because the double bond is at C3, which would require the structure to be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth. So, perhaps O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 is a single bond, but for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't fit because the double bond would be at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction. The starting material is an allyl ether. When an allyl ether reacts with HBr, what happens? I think allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening or addition. Alternatively, the allyl group could undergo addition with HBr.

Wait, but when an allyl group is present, especially in an ether, the reaction with HBr can proceed via acid-catalyzed addition. In this case, the butenyl group is part of an ether, so the reaction would be similar to the addition of HBr to an allyl ether.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not the case here; the starting material isn't an epoxide.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an addition across the double bond. For an allyl ether, adding HBr would proceed via a similar mechanism to the addition to an alkene. So the HBr adds to the double bond, making a di-substituted product.

Wait, but when HBr adds to an alkene, it typically does so via the bromonium ion formation. So in an allyl ether, the addition of HBr would occur at the double bond, leading to a brominated alkyl group.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction here is more about the possible addition or substitution. Let me think: the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. The double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, because the double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? That can't be because the butenyl group is four carbons in total. So the structure must be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, but that would make it but-2-en-1-yl, not but-3-en-1-yl.

I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The reaction is with HBr, which is a strong acid and a source of Br-. The starting material is an ether with an allyl group. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, leading to a carbocation and subsequent bromide attack.

Wait, but that's more typical for epoxides or certain other ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the allyl ether undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the bromide replaces the oxygen. But that's more common in good leaving groups, like tosylates or something. Oxygens in ethers are not typically good leaving groups without some activation.

Wait, but another possibility: the HBr might add to the double bond in the allyl group. So the addition of HBr to the double bond would lead to bromide addition. Let me think about the mechanism. The HBr would protonate the double bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation at the more substituted position. Then, the bromide ion would attack.

In the given case, the butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would require a four-carbon chain with a double bond between the last two carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it: CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that would be beyond the chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the butenyl group as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH. But that doesn't make sense for four carbons. I'm getting stuck, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two products, which would imply that the starting material can add HBr in two different positions, leading to different products. But in an allyl system, the addition of HBr would typically proceed in a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed. So perhaps the major product is the one where the bromide adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but if there's a possibility of two different products, perhaps the starting material has two different sites where the addition can occur or some rearrangement happens.

Wait, alternatively, the reaction could involve the allyl group opening via HBr addition, leading to a substituted bromide. But let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. Hmm, these are phenols with substituents. But how would that form? If the ether group (O-) is replaced by an -OH (phenol) and the rest is a butyl group. But that would require the oxygen to be replaced by HBr, which is substitution. But ethers are generally not reactive enough for that without some activation. Unless there's some acid catalysis leading to a good leaving group. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmmm. So one product is a brominated butoxy benzene, and the other is a butenyl group with a different substitution. Maybe the HBr adds to the double bond, leading to a brominated product, but perhaps with a shift or rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a bromide at the end, and another product is from a different mode of addition.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look more like possible products of some kind of ring-opening or cyclization. For example, chromane is a bicyclic structure, maybe formed from a six-membered ring with a bridge. Alternatively, benzofuran is a fused ring, which might form if the ether undergoes some kind of cyclization. But I'm not sure how HBr would lead to that. Maybe if the addition generates a carbocation that undergoes intramolecular attack, forming a ring. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both are brominated butoxy derivatives, but the bromine is at different positions. That suggests that HBr adds to the double bond in different positions, leading to different substituents. But in an allyl system, the addition of HBr would typically lead to a specific regiochemistry, so why would there be two different brominated products?

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a di-substituted alkene, which allows for two different sites of addition. Alternatively, maybe the bromide can add to either end of the double bond, leading to different products.

Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the structure is benzene ring - O - CH2 - C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2, but with a double bond between which carbons? Wait, but-3-en-1-yl implies the double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the butenyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between C3 and C4, which is the end of the chain. So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 → but with a double bond between the third and fourth, so Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 becomes Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is:

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph

Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)2-O-Ph? No, because the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH(CH3)2)-O-Ph? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would make the structure CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, which is the end, so it would be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 → but that's a single bond, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't make sense because there's no double bond. I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the possible products and which options match the reaction.

The reaction is between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and HBr. So the molecule has a benzene ring attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a butenyl group with 2,2-dimethyl substituents.

When HBr is added, it can add across the double bond. The addition of HBr to an allyl group would typically result in anti addition, leading to a bromide at the end. But if the starting material's double bond is in a particular position, the addition could lead to different products.

Looking at the options:

Option D suggests two different brominated products, each with bromine at position 3 and 4. That would imply that the addition of Br occurs at two different positions on the butenyl group.

Alternatively, option B suggests one brominated product and another product with a different structure. That might imply that the starting material undergoes both addition and some kind of rearrangement or isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: the HBr could add to the double bond in two different ways, leading to different regiochemical outcomes. But in allylic systems, the addition tends to be more about the more substituted position due to carbocation stability.

Wait, but if the starting material's double bond is in a position that allows for different regioselectivity upon addition, then two products could form. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of different carbocations, which could then capture Br- in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some kind of ring formation, such as a bicyclic structure, as in option C. But how would HBr lead to that?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, the starting material isn't an epoxide; it's an allyl ether. So that's not applicable.

Wait, thinking again about the possible structures:

If the starting material's butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which I think is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right because that would be a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, making it O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because that would make the last two CH2 groups have a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. No, that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should accept that I'm not getting the structure correctly and proceed based on the reaction possibilities.

If the reaction adds HBr to the double bond, the major product would be the bromide added to the more substituted carbon. Since the starting material is a butenyl group with 2,2-dimethyl substitution, the more substituted end would be the one with the substituents. So maybe the bromide adds to the end opposite the substituents, leading to a single product. But the question says two new spots appeared on TLC, implying two products.

So perhaps there's another possibility. Maybe the reaction isn't just addition but also involves some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility is that the HBr abstracts a proton from the butenyl group, leading to a carbocation, and then the bromide adds. But depending on where the carbocation forms, different products could form.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a possibility for two different addition sites, leading to two products.

But without the correct structure, it's hard to see. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material undergoes acid-catalyzed cleavage, leading to a phenol and another product.

Wait, looking back at option A, the products are phenols with substituents. So if the ether group (O-) is replaced by an -OH (phenol group), and the butenyl group is simply a substituent attached, that could be possible. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the O- group is replaced by Br, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage where the O breaks, and the HBr adds in a way that forms two products: one a phenol and another a bromide.

Wait, let me think. If the starting material is an ether, and HBr adds in such a way that the oxygen is replaced by Br, but that's more of an SN2 reaction, which is unlikely here. Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then leaves as H2O, forming a carbocation which then captures Br-.

But in that case, the phenol would form as one product, and the bromide would form another. Wait, but the starting material is an ether, so the O is connected to a butenyl group. If the O breaks, then the phenol would be Ph-OH, and the butenyl group would have a Br. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the HBr adds to the double bond, breaking the double bond and adding H and Br. Then, the product would be a bromide.

Wait, but if the addition is at the end, the Br would be on the fourth carbon, making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But where else could Br add? Maybe if the addition occurs at the other end, but that's only possible if the double bond is in a position that allows for two different additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a bromide on the third carbon, making (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But how?

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph. In that case, adding HBr could add to either end. So adding H to C2 and Br to C3 would give a product where Br is on C3. Alternatively, adding H to C3 and Br to C2 would give Br on C2. But wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph.

In that scenario, adding HBr could add across the double bond, leading to either:

1. Br on C2 (if H adds to C3), making (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Or

2. Br on C3 (if H adds to C2), making (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Wait, but butoxy has four carbons. Let me count:

If the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, adding HBr across the double bond (between C2 and C3) would produce:

Either H adds to C2 and Br to C3, giving CH2Br-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, but that's incorrect because the addition would be anti, so the structure would actually be CH2Br-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph, but I'm not sure about the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the more substituted carbocation, leading to Br adding to the less substituted position. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, the possible products in option D are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both have bromine on the butoxy group, but at different positions.

If the starting material's butenyl group is such that adding HBr can lead to bromine on either the third or fourth carbon, then option D would be the correct answer.

But then why would there be two products? Because the addition could have occurred at two different positions, perhaps due to different regiochemistry or because the starting material has some stereochemistry that allows for different additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has some possibility for different sites of addition, such as if the double bond is in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing for addition to either end, leading to bromide on C3 or C4.

But in that case, the reaction would form two products: one with Br on C3 and one on C4.

Looking at option D, the two products are 4-bromo and 3-bromo, which would fit.

So based on that, option D seems plausible.

Wait, but let me think again. If the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, then the butenyl group is at position 3. So the double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl group. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Or perhaps:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because that's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would make it Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond, so I'm clearly missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not matching the substituent description.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, meaning it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond in that position.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed based on the reaction possibilities.

If the addition of HBr leads to two different products, then the correct option would be the one where two brominated products are formed, which is option D.

Alternatively, option B suggests one product is a brominated butoxy benzene and another is a different butenyl group. That might involve some kind of rearrangement, like a hydride shift, leading to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, let me think: if the addition of HBr forms a carbocation, perhaps a hydride shift occurs to form a more stable carbocation. For example, if the initial carbocation is at C3 and it shifts to C4, leading to different products.

But in that case, you might get a single product, not two. Unless there are multiple sites for the carbocation to form, leading to different products.

Another possibility is that the starting material is such that the double bond can add HBr in two different ways, leading to two different products.

In any case, looking at the options, option D presents two different brominated products, which aligns with the idea that HBr adds to the double bond in two different positions, leading to two products.

So the correct answer is likely option D.


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the butenyl group is attached to a benzene ring via an oxygen atom. The double bond in the butenyl group is between carbons 3 and 4, and the substituents are two methyl groups on carbon 2. When HBr reacts with such a system, it typically adds across the double bond via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, forming a brominated product.

The reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by the bromide ion. Depending on the regioselectivity of the addition, bromine can add to either the third or fourth carbon of the butenyl group, leading to two different products. This explains the presence of two new spots on the TLC plate, indicating the formation of two distinct products.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Suggests the formation of two phenol derivatives. This would require the ether oxygen to be replaced by a hydroxyl group, which is unlikely under the given reaction conditions. Ethers are generally not reactive enough for such substitution without specific activation.

2. **Option B**: Proposes one brominated product and another with a different substitution pattern. This could involve rearrangement or isomerization, but it does not align well with the expected regioselectivity of HBr addition to the double bond.

3. **Option C**: Suggests the formation of cyclic products (chromane and benzofuran derivatives). These structures would require intramolecular cyclization, which is not supported by the reaction conditions or the starting material.

4. **Option D**: Indicates the formation of two brominated products, with bromine at positions 3 and 4 of the butenyl group. This aligns with the expected regioselectivity of HBr addition, where bromine can add to either the third or fourth carbon, depending on the carbocation stability during the reaction.

Given the reaction mechanism and the expected products, **Option D** is the most plausible, as it accounts for the formation of two distinct brominated products due to addition at different positions on the butenyl group.

Answer: D
