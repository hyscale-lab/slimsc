Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials A and B for each of the reactions. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two reactions were performed using different reducing agents. Reaction 1 uses LiBH4 and H+, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction 2 uses BH3 and H+, and the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the options given.

Hmm, wait. So each reaction starts with a different compound (A and B) and uses a different reducing agent. The products are enantiomers of each other because one is R and the other is S configuration.

Wait, but wait. What's the general process here? I think these reactions are about the reduction of ketones or something else. Oh, wait, the product is a cyclic ketoneâ€”tetrahydropyranone. So, maybe the starting materials are ketones that are being reduced, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but usually for carbonyls.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are cyclic ketones that are undergoing some kind of reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. Oh, wait, maybe these are reductions of epoxides. Because LiBH4 can reduce epoxides under certain conditions. Or maybe it's about the reduction of carbonyl groups leading to cyclic structures.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being ring-opened. Or maybe they are some kind of esters or other carbonyl compounds that form this upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones, and the reducing agents are opening them to form the cyclic ketone. No, wait, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols. Or maybe they're reducing a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Let me think about that. If you have an epoxide, and you reduce it with a hydride agent, maybe it would open the ring. But I'm not entirely sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are diethyl acetals or something similar. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another angle. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Its structure would be a six-membered ring (since pyran is six-membered) with a ketone group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is partially hydrogenated (tetrahydro), so it's a ring with four single bonds and one double bond, but wait, the 2H indicates that the double bond is between C1 and C2, I think. So the structure would be a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Wait, no, it's a pyranone, so it's a cyclic ketone with an oxygen in the ring.

Wait, so the structure of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is like O-C-C-C(ethyl)-C-C, with a ketone in the second position.

Hmm, perhaps the starting materials are ketones that are being reduced in a way that forms this structure. Or maybe they're esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, esters to alcohols, etc. BH3, especially in the form of BH3-THF, is a milder reducing agent, often used for the reduction of esters to alcohols but maybe under different conditions.

Wait, but wait. I remember that when using a borohydride reducing agent like LiBH4 or NaBH4, the stereochemistry of the product can depend on the structure of the starting material. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a single structure. So maybe the starting material isn't a ketone but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or lactones. Let me think. If the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, it forms a cyclic ketone? Hmm, I'm not sure about that. When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, it typically opens the ester group to form a diol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Epoxides can be opened under certain conditions. For example, using a hydride reagent to open an epoxide. Let me think: when an epoxide is treated with a hydride agent, like LiBH4, it can lead to the formation of alcohols. But would that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. For example, if you have a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone, and then some reaction occurs. But I'm not connecting the dots yet.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are reductions of cyclic ketals or acetals. Wait, no, acetals are typically not reduced by LiBH4. Maybe if the starting material is an acetal, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma or delta lactones. Wait, when a lactone is reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol, but that doesn't produce a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are doing something else, like ring-opening. Hmm, but how?

Wait, wait a minute. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the products. The products are (R) and (S) configurations of the same compound. So the starting materials must have different configurations that, upon reduction, lead to the opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, so the reducing agents must be influencing the stereochemistry of the product. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. How do their reactivities affect the product's configuration?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones. Let me imagine that. If the starting material is a cyclic ketone, upon reduction with a hydride, the ketone would become an alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone; that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds that, upon reduction, form the pyranone structure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide, like with LiBH4, you can get ring-opening. Let me think about that. The epoxide has two adjacent carbonyl groups (well, oxygen in a strained ring). Upon reduction, the hydride might attack one of the carbonyls, opening the epoxide and forming an alcohol. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. When you reduce a gamma-keto ester, you can get a cyclic structure. Wait, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation or something similar.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting materials are esters. If you have an ester group, and you reduce it, the ester becomes an alcohol. But how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). Let me think: if a lactone is reduced, it would become a diol, but that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with another functional group. For example, a cyclic ether with a ketone group. But then, the reduction would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, which doesn't fit the product.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction conditions and stereoselectivity. The two reactions produce enantiomers, which suggests that the starting materials have opposite configurations, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, so A and B are enantiomers. Because when they're reduced, they form the R and S products respectively. Or maybe it's the other way around. So if A is R configuration, then using a certain reagent gives R product, and B being S gives S product.

Wait, but the question is about the starting materials, which are the compounds A and B. So the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must have different configurations that lead to different configurations in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester? Like a lactone with a ketone group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms. When you reduce a cyclic ketone with a hydride, the ketone reduces to an alcohol. But that's not what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an acetal. Acetals are generally resistant to LiBH4, but perhaps under certain conditions, they can be reduced. If the starting material is an acetal, reduction would form an alcohol, but the product is a ketone.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, another approach: look at the product, which is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would have a six-membered ring with one oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol and a ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-closing reaction. For example, if the starting material is a diol with a carbonyl group, upon treatment with acid, it could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the reaction conditions involve LiBH4 and H+ (acid). So after the reduction, perhaps the product undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. Suppose the starting material is a ketone or ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then under acidic conditions cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine that. If A is a ketone, and LiBH4 reduces it to a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol (if there are two hydroxyl groups) could lose water and form a ring, creating the cyclic ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester. Let's say it's an ester of a diol and a carboxylic acid. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol might cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. Because when a gamma-keto ester is reduced, it can form a cyclic structure.

Wait, gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', where R and R' are substituents. When reduced, perhaps they form a cyclic diol or something else.

Wait, another thought: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me imagine the structure. The ring has six members: positions 1 (O), 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, 6. The substituents are at positions 2 (ketone) and 4 (ethyl). The ring is partially hydrogenated, so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. Wait, 2H-pyran means the double bond is between C1 and C2? Or perhaps C2 and C3? I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide followed by cyclization. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that, upon reduction, form a diol which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. Upon reduction, the ester part is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone remains, leading to the formation of the cyclic structure.

Wait, but that's a bit vague. Let me think of specific structures.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, no, the options are A and B as (S)- and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. The substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Wait, so the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group at position 1.

At position 3: ethyl.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (which is a ketone group).

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2,3,4,5 (CH3).

Wait, no. Let me number correctly. The formula for pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, maybe I should think: the formula is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but wait, that's five carbons in total. So the structure is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Correct structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's 4 carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's five carbons total. So the chain is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's six. Wait, no, COOH is the first carbon. So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? That's five? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, but I can proceed.

So the starting material is (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Position 3 has an ethyl group. Position 5 has an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, but wait, position 5 can't have both a substituent and a ketone. Because pentanoic acid has five carbons. So the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: OCH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy) and a ketone (O), but wait, how? Because position 5 is the end, maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps it's an acyloxy group? Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2, but with a ketone at position 5? Or perhaps the structure is such that position 5 has both the isobutoxy and the ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction. When this compound is treated with LiBH4 and H+, or with BH3 and H+, what happens?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces esters to alcohols, amides to amines, etc. But in this case, perhaps the starting material is an ester or an acetal.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So when treated with LiBH4, perhaps the ester group (if any) is reduced.

Wait, but the starting material as per the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: the structure would have a pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (O). So, position 5 would have both a ketone and an ether group?

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetylated or esterified version. Wait, maybe it's a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters are known to undergo reduction to form cyclic ketones when treated with certain reducing agents.

Wait, gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', where R and R' are substituents. When reduced with a hydride, they can form cyclic ketones.

Ah, I think that's the key. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced with a hydride, the carbonyl groups are reduced, leading to ring formation.

Wait, so let me think: a gamma-keto ester has a structure like CH2-CO-O-R attached to another CO group. Upon reduction, the alpha and beta carbonyls are reduced, leading to a cyclic structure.

Wait, more accurately, the gamma-keto ester would have the structure O=C-O-R connected to another carbonyl, perhaps like RCO-CO-O-R'. When reduced, the LiBH4 would attack the more electrophilic carbonyl (the ketone), opening the ester and forming a ring.

Wait, let's take an example: 

Suppose the starting material is CH2(CO-O-R)-CO-R. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (CO) would be reduced to CH2-OH, and the ester would be reduced to CH2-O-R. But perhaps the positions allow for ring closure.

Wait, perhaps the product is the result of a ring-closing upon reduction. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon reduction, the two carbonyl groups are reduced, allowing the molecule to form a ring.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material is something like this:

O
||
O-C-O-R
       |
CH2-CO-R'

Wait, perhaps. When LiBH4 reduces this, the ketone (CO) would be reduced to an alcohol, and the ester (COOR) would be reduced to an alcohol as well. So, the two carbonyl groups become two alcohol groups. If the structure is such that these two alcohols can form a ring upon elimination of water, then the product would be a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the elimination of the ester group and cyclizes to form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps only one of the carbonyl groups is reduced, and the other remains as a ketone, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, maybe the starting material has two carbonyl groups in such a way that upon reduction of one, the ring forms.

Wait, this is getting a bit vague, but let's try to tie it back to the problem.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

If the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like the options given (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but wait, that's five carbons. So position 1: COOH, position 2: CH2, position 3: C(O), position 4: CH2, position 5: OCH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but that would give us a structure where the gamma-keto group is at position 3, and an ester or ether group at position 5.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the starting material as an acyloxy ketone, which upon reduction forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enol ether or something similar that can form the cyclic ketone upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, it forms a diol, which under acidic conditions can cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think: if the starting material is a diethyl acetal, like (CH2CH3)2O-C-O-(CH2)3-CO-O-R, perhaps. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the acetal would be reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could lose a water molecule and form a ring, creating a cyclic hemiacetal or ketone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the options given.

The options for A and B are all (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the starting materials are enantiomers of each other.

Wait, so the starting materials are enantiomers, and when reduced with different agents, they form the R and S products.

Hmm. So, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a chiral ketone, and the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, but which reducing agents would lead to retention or inversion of configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and it typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reaction mechanism for LiBH4 reduction is typically a two-step process: the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an intermediate which then picks up the proton.

But in the case of cyclic ketones, the approach of the hydride can lead to different stereochemistry based on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's strength.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with a specific configuration, and the reducing agents cause ring-opening with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketals, which upon reduction yield diols, which then undergo acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let's think: if the starting material is a ketal (like a cyclic hemiacetal), then treatment with a reducing agent would open the ketal to form a diol. Under acidic conditions, the diol could cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is a cyclic ketal. For example, the structure would have an oxygen in the ring, connected to two CH2 groups, which upon reduction would form diols that could cyclize.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an orthoester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. For example, (CH2CH3)2O-C-O-(CH2)3-CO-R. Upon reduction, the acetal would break down to form a diol, which could then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Hmm, that makes sense. So, the starting material is a diethyl acetal (like a ketal) of a ketone. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the acetal to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but then what role does the configuration play here? Because the product's configuration depends on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a specific configuration (R or S). So, when the acetal is reduced, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the diol, which in turn determines the configuration of the cyclic ketone.

So, if the starting material is (R), then the diol formed would have a specific configuration, leading to the (R) product. Similarly, an (S) starting material would lead to the (S) product.

But wait, the two reactions are using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. How do these agents affect the stereochemistry of the product?

Wait, BH3 is typically used for reductions that require specific stereochemistry, like in the NaBH4 vs. LiAlH4 reductions. Wait, no, BH3 is more like a selective reducing agent, perhaps for esters or amides, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and would reduce the acetal more effectively, whereas BH3 might not reduce it as much. But that doesn't directly explain the stereochemistry.

Wait, another angle: the reducing agents might influence the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations in the product. For example, LiBH4 might approach from a certain face, leading to R configuration, while BH3 approaches differently, leading to S.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents affect whether the product is R or S based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is (R), when reduced with LiBH4, it forms (R) product, and when reduced with BH3, it forms (S). Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent together determine the product configuration.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. But looking at the options, the correct answer must be where A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as enantiomers. Options A and B have the same compounds for A and B, so they can't produce enantiomeric products.

So between C and D, the options are:

C) A = S, B = R

D) A = R, B = S

Now, the question is: which starting material when treated with which reagent gives which product.

In the problem statement, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R product, and reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S product.

So, A + LiBH4 â†’ R

B + BH3 â†’ S

But if A and B are enantiomers, then:

If A is R, then B is S.

If A is S, then B is R.

Now, depending on the reducing agent and the starting material's configuration, the product's configuration is determined.

Wait, perhaps the reaction using LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's strength affects the approach of the hydride, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome of these reductions. Maybe I should think about the models.

Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a certain configuration. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the acetal opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

The configuration of the diol would depend on the starting material's configuration and the approach of the hydride.

If the starting material is R, the diol formed would have a certain configuration, leading to the R product. Similarly, if the starting material is S, the product would be S.

Assuming that the reducing agents do not change the configuration, perhaps the configuration of the product directly reflects the starting material's configuration.

But in that case, if A is R and reduces to R, and B is S and reduces to S, then which reducing agent would do what?

Wait, but in the problem, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R, and reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S. So it's the same product from each reaction, but enantiomers.

So, if A is R, and reaction 1 gives R, and B is S, and reaction 2 gives S, then the answer would be D: A=R, B=S.

But wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the outcome. Suppose LiBH4 causes the product to have the same configuration as the starting material, and BH3 causes inversion.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps both reducing agents produce the same configuration, so the only way to get enantiomers is to have the starting materials as enantiomers, regardless of the reagent.

But the problem says each reaction uses a different reagent, leading to enantiomeric products. So, perhaps the reagents cause the opposite configuration when applied to enantiomeric starting materials.

Wait, but without knowing the exact effect of each reagent, it's hard to tell. But given the options, the correct answer must be either C or D, depending on which starting materials are enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent doesn't affect the configuration but the starting material's configuration does. So, if A is (R), the product is (R), and if B is (S), the product is (S).

So, in the problem, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R product. Reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S product.

So, if A is (R), and B is (S), the answer would be D: A=R, B=S.

Because when A (R) is reduced, it gives R, and when B (S) is reduced, it gives S.

But wait, I think that's the case. So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to identify how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Starting Materials**: The options for A and B are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This means that the stereochemistry of the starting materials directly influences the stereochemistry of the products.

3. **Reducing Agents**: 
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. 
   - BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used for selective reductions. 
   The stereochemical outcome of the reduction depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's selectivity.

4. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 â†’ (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction 2: B + BH3 â†’ (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

5. **Enantiomeric Relationship**: Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must also be enantiomers. This eliminates options A and B, where A and B are identical. The correct answer must be either C or D, where A and B are enantiomers.

6. **Determining the Correct Pair**:
   - If A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, it produces the (R)-product when reduced with LiBH4.
   - If B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, it produces the (S)-product when reduced with BH3.
   This matches the given reaction outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials A and B for each of the reactions. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two reactions were performed using different reducing agents. Reaction 1 uses LiBH4 and H+, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction 2 uses BH3 and H+, and the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the options given.

Hmm, wait. So each reaction starts with a different compound (A and B) and uses a different reducing agent. The products are enantiomers of each other because one is R and the other is S configuration.

Wait, but wait. What's the general process here? I think these reactions are about the reduction of ketones or something else. Oh, wait, the product is a cyclic ketoneâ€”tetrahydropyranone. So, maybe the starting materials are ketones that are being reduced, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but usually for carbonyls.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are cyclic ketones that are undergoing some kind of reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. Oh, wait, maybe these are reductions of epoxides. Because LiBH4 can reduce epoxides under certain conditions. Or maybe it's about the reduction of carbonyl groups leading to cyclic structures.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being ring-opened. Or maybe they are some kind of esters or other carbonyl compounds that form this upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones, and the reducing agents are opening them to form the cyclic ketone. No, wait, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols. Or maybe they're reducing a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Let me think about that. If you have an epoxide, and you reduce it with a hydride agent, maybe it would open the ring. But I'm not entirely sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are diethyl acetals or something similar. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another angle. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Its structure would be a six-membered ring (since pyran is six-membered) with a ketone group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is partially hydrogenated (tetrahydro), so it's a ring with four single bonds and one double bond, but wait, the 2H indicates that the double bond is between C1 and C2, I think. So the structure would be a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Wait, no, it's a pyranone, so it's a cyclic ketone with an oxygen in the ring.

Wait, so the structure of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is like O-C-C-C(ethyl)-C-C, with a ketone in the second position.

Hmm, perhaps the starting materials are ketones that are being reduced in a way that forms this structure. Or maybe they're esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, esters to alcohols, etc. BH3, especially in the form of BH3-THF, is a milder reducing agent, often used for the reduction of esters to alcohols but maybe under different conditions.

Wait, but wait. I remember that when using a borohydride reducing agent like LiBH4 or NaBH4, the stereochemistry of the product can depend on the structure of the starting material. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a single structure. So maybe the starting material isn't a ketone but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or lactones. Let me think. If the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, it forms a cyclic ketone? Hmm, I'm not sure about that. When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, it typically opens the ester group to form a diol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Epoxides can be opened under certain conditions. For example, using a hydride reagent to open an epoxide. Let me think: when an epoxide is treated with a hydride agent, like LiBH4, it can lead to the formation of alcohols. But would that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. For example, if you have a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone, and then some reaction occurs. But I'm not connecting the dots yet.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are reductions of cyclic ketals or acetals. Wait, no, acetals are typically not reduced by LiBH4. Maybe if the starting material is an acetal, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma or delta lactones. Wait, when a lactone is reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol, but that doesn't produce a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are doing something else, like ring-opening. Hmm, but how?

Wait, wait a minute. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the products. The products are (R) and (S) configurations of the same compound. So the starting materials must have different configurations that, upon reduction, lead to the opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, so the reducing agents must be influencing the stereochemistry of the product. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. How do their reactivities affect the product's configuration?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones. Let me imagine that. If the starting material is a cyclic ketone, upon reduction with a hydride, the ketone would become an alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone; that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds that, upon reduction, form the pyranone structure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide, like with LiBH4, you can get ring-opening. Let me think about that. The epoxide has two adjacent carbonyl groups (well, oxygen in a strained ring). Upon reduction, the hydride might attack one of the carbonyls, opening the epoxide and forming an alcohol. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. When you reduce a gamma-keto ester, you can get a cyclic structure. Wait, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation or something similar.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting materials are esters. If you have an ester group, and you reduce it, the ester becomes an alcohol. But how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). Let me think: if a lactone is reduced, it would become a diol, but that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with another functional group. For example, a cyclic ether with a ketone group. But then, the reduction would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, which doesn't fit the product.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction conditions and stereoselectivity. The two reactions produce enantiomers, which suggests that the starting materials have opposite configurations, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, so A and B are enantiomers. Because when they're reduced, they form the R and S products respectively. Or maybe it's the other way around. So if A is R configuration, then using a certain reagent gives R product, and B being S gives S product.

Wait, but the question is about the starting materials, which are the compounds A and B. So the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must have different configurations that lead to different configurations in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester? Like a lactone with a ketone group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms. When you reduce a cyclic ketone with a hydride, the ketone reduces to an alcohol. But that's not what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an acetal. Acetals are generally resistant to LiBH4, but perhaps under certain conditions, they can be reduced. If the starting material is an acetal, reduction would form an alcohol, but the product is a ketone.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, another approach: look at the product, which is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would have a six-membered ring with one oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol and a ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-closing reaction. For example, if the starting material is a diol with a carbonyl group, upon treatment with acid, it could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the reaction conditions involve LiBH4 and H+ (acid). So after the reduction, perhaps the product undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. Suppose the starting material is a ketone or ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then under acidic conditions cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine that. If A is a ketone, and LiBH4 reduces it to a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol (if there are two hydroxyl groups) could lose water and form a ring, creating the cyclic ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester. Let's say it's an ester of a diol and a carboxylic acid. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol might cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. Because when a gamma-keto ester is reduced, it can form a cyclic structure.

Wait, gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', where R and R' are substituents. When reduced, perhaps they form a cyclic diol or something else.

Wait, another thought: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me imagine the structure. The ring has six members: positions 1 (O), 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, 6. The substituents are at positions 2 (ketone) and 4 (ethyl). The ring is partially hydrogenated, so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. Wait, 2H-pyran means the double bond is between C1 and C2? Or perhaps C2 and C3? I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide followed by cyclization. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that, upon reduction, form a diol which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. Upon reduction, the ester part is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone remains, leading to the formation of the cyclic structure.

Wait, but that's a bit vague. Let me think of specific structures.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, no, the options are A and B as (S)- and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. The substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Wait, so the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group at position 1.

At position 3: ethyl.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (which is a ketone group).

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2,3,4,5 (CH3).

Wait, no. Let me number correctly. The formula for pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, maybe I should think: the formula is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but wait, that's five carbons in total. So the structure is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's hexanoic acid. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Correct structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's 4 carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's five carbons total. So the chain is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's six. Wait, no, COOH is the first carbon. So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? That's five? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, but I can proceed.

So the starting material is (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Position 3 has an ethyl group. Position 5 has an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, but wait, position 5 can't have both a substituent and a ketone. Because pentanoic acid has five carbons. So the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: OCH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy) and a ketone (O), but wait, how? Because position 5 is the end, maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps it's an acyloxy group? Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2, but with a ketone at position 5? Or perhaps the structure is such that position 5 has both the isobutoxy and the ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction. When this compound is treated with LiBH4 and H+, or with BH3 and H+, what happens?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces esters to alcohols, amides to amines, etc. But in this case, perhaps the starting material is an ester or an acetal.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So when treated with LiBH4, perhaps the ester group (if any) is reduced.

Wait, but the starting material as per the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: the structure would have a pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (O). So, position 5 would have both a ketone and an ether group?

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetylated or esterified version. Wait, maybe it's a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters are known to undergo reduction to form cyclic ketones when treated with certain reducing agents.

Wait, gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', where R and R' are substituents. When reduced with a hydride, they can form cyclic ketones.

Ah, I think that's the key. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced with a hydride, the carbonyl groups are reduced, leading to ring formation.

Wait, so let me think: a gamma-keto ester has a structure like CH2-CO-O-R attached to another CO group. Upon reduction, the alpha and beta carbonyls are reduced, leading to a cyclic structure.

Wait, more accurately, the gamma-keto ester would have the structure O=C-O-R connected to another carbonyl, perhaps like RCO-CO-O-R'. When reduced, the LiBH4 would attack the more electrophilic carbonyl (the ketone), opening the ester and forming a ring.

Wait, let's take an example: 

Suppose the starting material is CH2(CO-O-R)-CO-R. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (CO) would be reduced to CH2-OH, and the ester would be reduced to CH2-O-R. But perhaps the positions allow for ring closure.

Wait, perhaps the product is the result of a ring-closing upon reduction. So, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon reduction, the two carbonyl groups are reduced, allowing the molecule to form a ring.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material is something like this:

O
||
O-C-O-R
       |
CH2-CO-R'

Wait, perhaps. When LiBH4 reduces this, the ketone (CO) would be reduced to an alcohol, and the ester (COOR) would be reduced to an alcohol as well. So, the two carbonyl groups become two alcohol groups. If the structure is such that these two alcohols can form a ring upon elimination of water, then the product would be a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the elimination of the ester group and cyclizes to form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps only one of the carbonyl groups is reduced, and the other remains as a ketone, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, maybe the starting material has two carbonyl groups in such a way that upon reduction of one, the ring forms.

Wait, this is getting a bit vague, but let's try to tie it back to the problem.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

If the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like the options given (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but wait, that's five carbons. So position 1: COOH, position 2: CH2, position 3: C(O), position 4: CH2, position 5: OCH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but that would give us a structure where the gamma-keto group is at position 3, and an ester or ether group at position 5.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the starting material as an acyloxy ketone, which upon reduction forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enol ether or something similar that can form the cyclic ketone upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, it forms a diol, which under acidic conditions can cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think: if the starting material is a diethyl acetal, like (CH2CH3)2O-C-O-(CH2)3-CO-O-R, perhaps. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the acetal would be reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could lose a water molecule and form a ring, creating a cyclic hemiacetal or ketone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the options given.

The options for A and B are all (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the starting materials are enantiomers of each other.

Wait, so the starting materials are enantiomers, and when reduced with different agents, they form the R and S products.

Hmm. So, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a chiral ketone, and the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, but which reducing agents would lead to retention or inversion of configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and it typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reaction mechanism for LiBH4 reduction is typically a two-step process: the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an intermediate which then picks up the proton.

But in the case of cyclic ketones, the approach of the hydride can lead to different stereochemistry based on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's strength.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with a specific configuration, and the reducing agents cause ring-opening with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketals, which upon reduction yield diols, which then undergo acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let's think: if the starting material is a ketal (like a cyclic hemiacetal), then treatment with a reducing agent would open the ketal to form a diol. Under acidic conditions, the diol could cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is a cyclic ketal. For example, the structure would have an oxygen in the ring, connected to two CH2 groups, which upon reduction would form diols that could cyclize.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an orthoester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. For example, (CH2CH3)2O-C-O-(CH2)3-CO-R. Upon reduction, the acetal would break down to form a diol, which could then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Hmm, that makes sense. So, the starting material is a diethyl acetal (like a ketal) of a ketone. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the acetal to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but then what role does the configuration play here? Because the product's configuration depends on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a specific configuration (R or S). So, when the acetal is reduced, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the diol, which in turn determines the configuration of the cyclic ketone.

So, if the starting material is (R), then the diol formed would have a specific configuration, leading to the (R) product. Similarly, an (S) starting material would lead to the (S) product.

But wait, the two reactions are using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. How do these agents affect the stereochemistry of the product?

Wait, BH3 is typically used for reductions that require specific stereochemistry, like in the NaBH4 vs. LiAlH4 reductions. Wait, no, BH3 is more like a selective reducing agent, perhaps for esters or amides, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and would reduce the acetal more effectively, whereas BH3 might not reduce it as much. But that doesn't directly explain the stereochemistry.

Wait, another angle: the reducing agents might influence the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations in the product. For example, LiBH4 might approach from a certain face, leading to R configuration, while BH3 approaches differently, leading to S.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents affect whether the product is R or S based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is (R), when reduced with LiBH4, it forms (R) product, and when reduced with BH3, it forms (S). Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent together determine the product configuration.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. But looking at the options, the correct answer must be where A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as enantiomers. Options A and B have the same compounds for A and B, so they can't produce enantiomeric products.

So between C and D, the options are:

C) A = S, B = R

D) A = R, B = S

Now, the question is: which starting material when treated with which reagent gives which product.

In the problem statement, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R product, and reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S product.

So, A + LiBH4 â†’ R

B + BH3 â†’ S

But if A and B are enantiomers, then:

If A is R, then B is S.

If A is S, then B is R.

Now, depending on the reducing agent and the starting material's configuration, the product's configuration is determined.

Wait, perhaps the reaction using LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion. Or the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's strength affects the approach of the hydride, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemical outcome of these reductions. Maybe I should think about the models.

Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a certain configuration. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the acetal opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

The configuration of the diol would depend on the starting material's configuration and the approach of the hydride.

If the starting material is R, the diol formed would have a certain configuration, leading to the R product. Similarly, if the starting material is S, the product would be S.

Assuming that the reducing agents do not change the configuration, perhaps the configuration of the product directly reflects the starting material's configuration.

But in that case, if A is R and reduces to R, and B is S and reduces to S, then which reducing agent would do what?

Wait, but in the problem, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R, and reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S. So it's the same product from each reaction, but enantiomers.

So, if A is R, and reaction 1 gives R, and B is S, and reaction 2 gives S, then the answer would be D: A=R, B=S.

But wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the outcome. Suppose LiBH4 causes the product to have the same configuration as the starting material, and BH3 causes inversion.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps both reducing agents produce the same configuration, so the only way to get enantiomers is to have the starting materials as enantiomers, regardless of the reagent.

But the problem says each reaction uses a different reagent, leading to enantiomeric products. So, perhaps the reagents cause the opposite configuration when applied to enantiomeric starting materials.

Wait, but without knowing the exact effect of each reagent, it's hard to tell. But given the options, the correct answer must be either C or D, depending on which starting materials are enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent doesn't affect the configuration but the starting material's configuration does. So, if A is (R), the product is (R), and if B is (S), the product is (S).

So, in the problem, reaction 1 uses A and LiBH4 to give R product. Reaction 2 uses B and BH3 to give S product.

So, if A is (R), and B is (S), the answer would be D: A=R, B=S.

Because when A (R) is reduced, it gives R, and when B (S) is reduced, it gives S.

But wait, I think that's the case. So, the correct answer is D.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to identify how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Starting Materials**: The options for A and B are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This means that the stereochemistry of the starting materials directly influences the stereochemistry of the products.

3. **Reducing Agents**: 
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. 
   - BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used for selective reductions. 
   The stereochemical outcome of the reduction depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's selectivity.

4. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 â†’ (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction 2: B + BH3 â†’ (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

5. **Enantiomeric Relationship**: Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must also be enantiomers. This eliminates options A and B, where A and B are identical. The correct answer must be either C or D, where A and B are enantiomers.

6. **Determining the Correct Pair**:
   - If A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, it produces the (R)-product when reduced with LiBH4.
   - If B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, it produces the (S)-product when reduced with BH3.
   This matches the given reaction outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

ANSWER: D
