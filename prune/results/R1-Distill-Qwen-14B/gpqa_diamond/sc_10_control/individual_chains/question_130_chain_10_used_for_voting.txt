Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting quasars using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, including at certain wavelengths like the Lyman alpha line. Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line from hydrogen, right? Its rest wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. Oh right, because hydrogen's first excited state emits at that wavelength when it drops back to the ground state.

Now, the question is about detecting these clouds when they absorb the quasar's light. So these clouds are in deep space, and when a quasar's light passes through them, the hydrogen in the clouds absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But wait, the quasar's light is coming from very far away, so the wavelength we observe will be redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, right?

The problem is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these absorption features can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes, I think, can't detect wavelengths beyond a certain point. The atmosphere of the Earth absorbs a lot of infrared and UV light, making ground-based telescopes limited in what they can observe. Oh yeah, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see those wavelengths. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical range, then we can detect it.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Let me convert that to nanometers because optical wavelengths are usually in the hundreds of nanometers. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far-ultraviolet. But optical wavelengths are about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if the absorption is redshifted into the optical range, that means the quasar's light has been redshifted enough so that 1216 Angstroms becomes something like 400 nm or longer.

So the redshift z is given by the formula (observed wavelength) = (rest wavelength) * (1 + z). We want the observed wavelength to be at least in the optical range. Let's say the minimum is about 400 nm. So, 400 nm equals 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). Wait, wait, because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z: (4000/1216) = 1 + z. Let me calculate that.

4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1200 * 3 is 3600. 4000 is 400 more than 3600. 1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 352 / 1216 is about 0.29. So 3.29? Wait, no, 3 plus 0.29 gives 3.29. So z is about 3.29. So the redshift would need to be at least about 3.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit for the redshift. Because if the redshift is smaller than that, the observed wavelength would be less than 400 nm, which is UV and not detectable by optical telescopes. So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm. So the minimal z is approximately 3.29.

Looking at the options, option A is 3, which is just under our calculated 3.29. Option C is 2.4, which is lower. Wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 4000 Angstroms is the observed wavelength. So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). So 1 + z = 4000 /1216 ≈ 3.29. So z≈ 2.29? Wait, no. Wait 4000 divided by 1216. Let me do it more accurately. 1216 *3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216=0.289 approx. So 3.289, so z≈ 2.289? No, wait, wait. Because 1 + z = 3.289, so z is about 2.289. Oh wait, no, 1 + z is 3.289, so z is 2.289, not 3.289. Because if observed wavelength is longer than rest, z is positive. So when the rest is 1216, observed is 4000. So 4000/1216 = approx 3.289. So 1 + z = 3.289, so z=2.289. So about 2.29.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the closest is option C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal z would be about 2.29, which is lower than option C. Hmm, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.289, so any z higher than that would have the observed wavelength in optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29.

But wait, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." So the minimal redshift z_min is when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range. So the minimal z is 3.289 - no, wait, z is 2.289 because 1216*(1+2.289)= 1216*3.289= approx 4000. So yes, z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any z above that would be detectable because the wavelength is in optical.

So the options are, the options are:

A) 3

B) 1.2

C) 2.4

D) 1.9

So the correct answer would be the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is that. So the correct option is C) 2.4, because 2.4 is the smallest option that is higher than 2.29. Or wait, no. The question is to find the lower limit, meaning the minimal z that allows detection. So if the object has a redshift above 2.29, it's detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit on the redshift is 2.29. So the answer would be the option that's the smallest possible one that allows detection, which is 2.29. So the options don't have 2.29, but the options include 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D) and 3 (A). So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. So option C) 2.4 is the next higher value, but the question is about the lower limit. So what's the question again? It says, "what is the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected."

Wait, lower limit on the redshift. So the lowest possible redshift that allows detection is 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so any object with higher z would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer is the option that is the minimal possible z just allowing detection. So the options provided: the closest is option C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the correct option is C) 2.4 because it's the first option that's higher than the minimal. Wait, but the question says "lower limit", which is the minimal z. So the actual minimal z is 2.29. But since none of the options have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The observed wavelength for Lyman alpha would be 1216*(1+z). We need that observed wavelength to be in the optical range. So optical is about 400 nm to 700 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms.

So to find the minimal z, the minimal redshift is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)

So (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.289

So z = 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So approximately z=2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So any higher z will be in the optical range.

So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the objects must have a redshift of at least about 2.29 to be detected.

Looking back at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the correct option is the one that's just above 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and A)3. So option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is looking for the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical range. So the correct minimal z is 2.29, so the closest option is C)2.4. Or wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait another approach: perhaps the 1216 Angstroms is in the rest frame of the quasar. When the quasar is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). But for the absorption to be in the optical range, 1216*(1+z) needs to be less than 7000 Angstroms (since optical is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, no: if z is higher, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the observed wavelength is in optical (4000-7000 Angstroms), then 1216*(1+z) should be between 4000 and 7000.

Wait, wait, no: 1216*(1+z) must be in the optical range for detection. So for the minimal z, the observed wavelength should be at least 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So solving for z as before gives z≈2.29.

But perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the quasar and then absorbed by intervening clouds. So the quasar's own light may be redshifted, but the clouds are in front. Wait, but the question says that the clouds are in deep space and absorb the light from the quasars. So the quasar is behind the cloud, and the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which imprints the absorption line.

So the quasar's light is at a higher redshift (because it's further away) than the cloud. Or wait, no—clouds are in the line of sight, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the clouds. So when the light from the quasar (at redshift z_q) passes through the cloud (at redshift z_c), the cloud's hydrogen will cause absorption at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_c). But for the observer to see that absorption in the quasar's spectrum, the quasar's spectrum must be redshifted such that 1216*(1 + z_c) falls into the optical range.

Wait, no. Let me model it correctly. The quasar emits the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms. If a cloud is at redshift z_cloud, then the quasar's light, when passing through the cloud, would have the cloud absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the absorption from the cloud would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Wait, but if the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud, then the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's observed frame. Because the quasar's light is at (1 + z_quasar) longer wavelength.

So the quasar's observed emission line is at 1216*(1+z_quasar). The absorption line from the intervening cloud would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But since z_cloud < z_quasar, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength than the emission line.

Wait, but for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be in the optical range. So, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms (so 400 nm). So 1 + z_cloud >= 4000/1216 ≈3.289. So z_cloud >= 2.289.

So the cloud must have a redshift of at least ~2.29 for the absorption to be in the optical. So the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud is 2.29. So the quasar's redshift is higher, but the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.29 for its absorption to be in the optical.

So the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected. So the minimal z for the cloud is 2.29.

Looking at the options again: option C is 2.4. So the answer should be C, since 2.4 is the smallest option above 2.29. Or wait, the question says 'lower limit on the redshift of this objects'—so the minimal z. But none of the options are exactly 2.29. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm confusing the quasar's redshift with the cloud's. The question says the clouds are in deep space and absorb the quasar's light. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is z_cloud, and the quasar's is z_quasar > z_cloud.

The quasar's light is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 Angstroms. The cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's original frame. But when observed, the absorption line is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216*(1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the light from the quasar passes through the cloud. The cloud is at a redshift z_cloud. The quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar. So the light from the quasar, when it reaches the cloud, has a certain wavelength. The cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms in its own rest frame. So the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame.

But the light that the quasar emits is at 1216 Angstroms (if it emits the Lyman alpha line). Then when the light reaches the cloud, the cloud sees the quasar's light redshifted. So the cloud sees the light at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Angstroms. Because the cloud is at z_cloud relative to the quasar's frame. Wait, no, the quasar is at a higher redshift.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of observed wavelengths. The quasar's own Lyman alpha line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The intervening cloud, at redshift z_cloud, would have caused absorption at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But since the cloud is in front of the quasar, z_cloud < z_quasar. So that absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum at a shorter wavelength than the quasar's own emission line.

Wait, but for the absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be >= 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), so z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈ 2.289. So the cloud's redshift must be at least about 2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, so the answer is option C)2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.29.

But wait the options have A)3, which is higher than 2.29. So which is the correct answer? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's light is what's being observed, and the absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The intervening cloud, with redshift z_cloud, would have caused absorption at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. Wait, no. Because the light from the quasar that passes through the cloud is redshifted by the cloud's z_cloud. So the cloud would absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. But since the quasar is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength of that absorption line would be 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. The quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms. The intervening cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So, when the light from the quasar (at redshift z_quasar) arrives at the cloud, the wavelength is stretched by (1 + z_cloud). So the cloud sees the quasar's light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Because the quasar is at a higher redshift, the light the cloud intercepts has already been redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar? Or wait, the quasar is at a higher redshift, so the light from the quasar that the cloud intercepts is redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar. So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha is at 1216, so at the cloud's position, it's redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud then absorbs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in its own frame. So in the quasar's frame, the absorption would be at ... Hmm, maybe it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud), but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the observed absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar). No, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the observed absorption line's wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_cloud) ??? No, that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength of the absorption line is determined by the total redshift from the source (quasar) through the cloud. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the light from the quasar is redshifted due to the quasar's z_quasar, then as it passes through the cloud, the cloud is at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar). So the light that we receive has been redshifted by both the cloud and the quasar.

Wait, but the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the quasar's light, when it arrives at the cloud, has been redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar. Then, the cloud imprints an absorption line at a wavelength that is 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. So the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. Because from the quasar's perspective, the cloud is at z_cloud, so the light that's reaching it from the quasar is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 Angstroms. So the cloud will absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) multiplied by (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar). Because the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption happens at a wavelength that's shorter than the quasar's emission. So observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) ) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

Wait, that seems to bring us back to the previous conclusion. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for that to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈3.289-1=2.289.

So the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.289 for the absorption to be in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, and the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal z is 2.29, so the only option higher than that is C)2.4. So the answer must be C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we start by noting that the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of hydrogen. Optical telescopes can detect wavelengths in the range of approximately 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). For the absorption line to be observed in the optical range, the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{observed}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}\) (the lower limit of the optical range). Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift \(z\) for the Lyman alpha absorption to be detected in the optical range is approximately \(2.29\). This means that any cloud with a redshift \(z \geq 2.29\) will have its Lyman alpha absorption line redshifted into the optical range and detectable by optical telescopes.

Now, analyzing the options provided:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit of \(2.29\), so it is valid but not the minimal value.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than \(2.29\), so it is invalid.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \(2.29\), making it the smallest valid option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is also lower than \(2.29\), so it is invalid.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, which corresponds to the minimal \(z\) that allows detection. Since the exact value \(2.29\) is not listed, the closest higher value is \(2.4\), making **C** the correct answer.

Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting quasars using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, including at certain wavelengths like the Lyman alpha line. Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line from hydrogen, right? Its rest wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. Oh right, because hydrogen's first excited state emits at that wavelength when it drops back to the ground state.

Now, the question is about detecting these clouds when they absorb the quasar's light. So these clouds are in deep space, and when a quasar's light passes through them, the hydrogen in the clouds absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But wait, the quasar's light is coming from very far away, so the wavelength we observe will be redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, right?

The problem is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these absorption features can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes, I think, can't detect wavelengths beyond a certain point. The atmosphere of the Earth absorbs a lot of infrared and UV light, making ground-based telescopes limited in what they can observe. Oh yeah, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see those wavelengths. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical range, then we can detect it.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Let me convert that to nanometers because optical wavelengths are usually in the hundreds of nanometers. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far-ultraviolet. But optical wavelengths are about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if the absorption is redshifted into the optical range, that means the quasar's light has been redshifted enough so that 1216 Angstroms becomes something like 400 nm or longer.

So the redshift z is given by the formula (observed wavelength) = (rest wavelength) * (1 + z). We want the observed wavelength to be at least in the optical range. Let's say the minimum is about 400 nm. So, 400 nm equals 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). Wait, wait, because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z: (4000/1216) = 1 + z. Let me calculate that.

4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1200 * 3 is 3600. 4000 is 400 more than 3600. 1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 352 / 1216 is about 0.29. So 3.29? Wait, no, 3 plus 0.29 gives 3.29. So z is about 3.29. So the redshift would need to be at least about 3.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit for the redshift. Because if the redshift is smaller than that, the observed wavelength would be less than 400 nm, which is UV and not detectable by optical telescopes. So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm. So the minimal z is approximately 3.29.

Looking at the options, option A is 3, which is just under our calculated 3.29. Option C is 2.4, which is lower. Wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 4000 Angstroms is the observed wavelength. So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). So 1 + z = 4000 /1216 ≈ 3.29. So z≈ 2.29? Wait, no. Wait 4000 divided by 1216. Let me do it more accurately. 1216 *3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216=0.289 approx. So 3.289, so z≈ 2.289? No, wait, wait. Because 1 + z = 3.289, so z is about 2.289. Oh wait, no, 1 + z is 3.289, so z is 2.289, not 3.289. Because if observed wavelength is longer than rest, z is positive. So when the rest is 1216, observed is 4000. So 4000/1216 = approx 3.289. So 1 + z = 3.289, so z=2.289. So about 2.29.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the closest is option C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal z would be about 2.29, which is lower than option C. Hmm, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.289, so any z higher than that would have the observed wavelength in optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29.

But wait, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." So the minimal redshift z_min is when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range. So the minimal z is 3.289 - no, wait, z is 2.289 because 1216*(1+2.289)= 1216*3.289= approx 4000. So yes, z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any z above that would be detectable because the wavelength is in optical.

So the options are, the options are:

A) 3

B) 1.2

C) 2.4

D) 1.9

So the correct answer would be the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is that. So the correct option is C) 2.4, because 2.4 is the smallest option that is higher than 2.29. Or wait, no. The question is to find the lower limit, meaning the minimal z that allows detection. So if the object has a redshift above 2.29, it's detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit on the redshift is 2.29. So the answer would be the option that's the smallest possible one that allows detection, which is 2.29. So the options don't have 2.29, but the options include 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D) and 3 (A). So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. So option C) 2.4 is the next higher value, but the question is about the lower limit. So what's the question again? It says, "what is the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected."

Wait, lower limit on the redshift. So the lowest possible redshift that allows detection is 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so any object with higher z would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer is the option that is the minimal possible z just allowing detection. So the options provided: the closest is option C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the correct option is C) 2.4 because it's the first option that's higher than the minimal. Wait, but the question says "lower limit", which is the minimal z. So the actual minimal z is 2.29. But since none of the options have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The observed wavelength for Lyman alpha would be 1216*(1+z). We need that observed wavelength to be in the optical range. So optical is about 400 nm to 700 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms.

So to find the minimal z, the minimal redshift is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)

So (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.289

So z = 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So approximately z=2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So any higher z will be in the optical range.

So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the objects must have a redshift of at least about 2.29 to be detected.

Looking back at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the correct option is the one that's just above 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and A)3. So option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is looking for the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical range. So the correct minimal z is 2.29, so the closest option is C)2.4. Or wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait another approach: perhaps the 1216 Angstroms is in the rest frame of the quasar. When the quasar is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). But for the absorption to be in the optical range, 1216*(1+z) needs to be less than 7000 Angstroms (since optical is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, no: if z is higher, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the observed wavelength is in optical (4000-7000 Angstroms), then 1216*(1+z) should be between 4000 and 7000.

Wait, wait, no: 1216*(1+z) must be in the optical range for detection. So for the minimal z, the observed wavelength should be at least 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So solving for z as before gives z≈2.29.

But perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the quasar and then absorbed by intervening clouds. So the quasar's own light may be redshifted, but the clouds are in front. Wait, but the question says that the clouds are in deep space and absorb the light from the quasars. So the quasar is behind the cloud, and the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which imprints the absorption line.

So the quasar's light is at a higher redshift (because it's further away) than the cloud. Or wait, no—clouds are in the line of sight, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the clouds. So when the light from the quasar (at redshift z_q) passes through the cloud (at redshift z_c), the cloud's hydrogen will cause absorption at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_c). But for the observer to see that absorption in the quasar's spectrum, the quasar's spectrum must be redshifted such that 1216*(1 + z_c) falls into the optical range.

Wait, no. Let me model it correctly. The quasar emits the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms. If a cloud is at redshift z_cloud, then the quasar's light, when passing through the cloud, would have the cloud absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the absorption from the cloud would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Wait, but if the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud, then the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's observed frame. Because the quasar's light is at (1 + z_quasar) longer wavelength.

So the quasar's observed emission line is at 1216*(1+z_quasar). The absorption line from the intervening cloud would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But since z_cloud < z_quasar, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength than the emission line.

Wait, but for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be in the optical range. So, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms (so 400 nm). So 1 + z_cloud >= 4000/1216 ≈3.289. So z_cloud >= 2.289.

So the cloud must have a redshift of at least ~2.29 for the absorption to be in the optical. So the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud is 2.29. So the quasar's redshift is higher, but the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.29 for its absorption to be in the optical.

So the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected. So the minimal z for the cloud is 2.29.

Looking at the options again: option C is 2.4. So the answer should be C, since 2.4 is the smallest option above 2.29. Or wait, the question says 'lower limit on the redshift of this objects'—so the minimal z. But none of the options are exactly 2.29. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm confusing the quasar's redshift with the cloud's. The question says the clouds are in deep space and absorb the quasar's light. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is z_cloud, and the quasar's is z_quasar > z_cloud.

The quasar's light is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 Angstroms. The cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's original frame. But when observed, the absorption line is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216*(1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the light from the quasar passes through the cloud. The cloud is at a redshift z_cloud. The quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar. So the light from the quasar, when it reaches the cloud, has a certain wavelength. The cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms in its own rest frame. So the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame.

But the light that the quasar emits is at 1216 Angstroms (if it emits the Lyman alpha line). Then when the light reaches the cloud, the cloud sees the quasar's light redshifted. So the cloud sees the light at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Angstroms. Because the cloud is at z_cloud relative to the quasar's frame. Wait, no, the quasar is at a higher redshift.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of observed wavelengths. The quasar's own Lyman alpha line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The intervening cloud, at redshift z_cloud, would have caused absorption at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But since the cloud is in front of the quasar, z_cloud < z_quasar. So that absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum at a shorter wavelength than the quasar's own emission line.

Wait, but for the absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be >= 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), so z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈ 2.289. So the cloud's redshift must be at least about 2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, so the answer is option C)2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.29.

But wait the options have A)3, which is higher than 2.29. So which is the correct answer? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's light is what's being observed, and the absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The intervening cloud, with redshift z_cloud, would have caused absorption at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. Wait, no. Because the light from the quasar that passes through the cloud is redshifted by the cloud's z_cloud. So the cloud would absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. But since the quasar is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength of that absorption line would be 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. The quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms. The intervening cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So, when the light from the quasar (at redshift z_quasar) arrives at the cloud, the wavelength is stretched by (1 + z_cloud). So the cloud sees the quasar's light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Because the quasar is at a higher redshift, the light the cloud intercepts has already been redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar? Or wait, the quasar is at a higher redshift, so the light from the quasar that the cloud intercepts is redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar. So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha is at 1216, so at the cloud's position, it's redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud then absorbs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in its own frame. So in the quasar's frame, the absorption would be at ... Hmm, maybe it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud), but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the observed absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar). No, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the observed absorption line's wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_cloud) ??? No, that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength of the absorption line is determined by the total redshift from the source (quasar) through the cloud. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the light from the quasar is redshifted due to the quasar's z_quasar, then as it passes through the cloud, the cloud is at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar). So the light that we receive has been redshifted by both the cloud and the quasar.

Wait, but the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the quasar's light, when it arrives at the cloud, has been redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar. Then, the cloud imprints an absorption line at a wavelength that is 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. So the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. Because from the quasar's perspective, the cloud is at z_cloud, so the light that's reaching it from the quasar is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 Angstroms. So the cloud will absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) )? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) multiplied by (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar). Because the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption happens at a wavelength that's shorter than the quasar's emission. So observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud)/(1 + z_quasar) ) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

Wait, that seems to bring us back to the previous conclusion. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for that to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈3.289-1=2.289.

So the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.289 for the absorption to be in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, and the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal z is 2.29, so the only option higher than that is C)2.4. So the answer must be C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we start by noting that the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of hydrogen. Optical telescopes can detect wavelengths in the range of approximately 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). For the absorption line to be observed in the optical range, the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{observed}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}\) (the lower limit of the optical range). Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift \(z\) for the Lyman alpha absorption to be detected in the optical range is approximately \(2.29\). This means that any cloud with a redshift \(z \geq 2.29\) will have its Lyman alpha absorption line redshifted into the optical range and detectable by optical telescopes.

Now, analyzing the options provided:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit of \(2.29\), so it is valid but not the minimal value.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than \(2.29\), so it is invalid.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \(2.29\), making it the smallest valid option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is also lower than \(2.29\), so it is invalid.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, which corresponds to the minimal \(z\) that allows detection. Since the exact value \(2.29\) is not listed, the closest higher value is \(2.4\), making **C** the correct answer.

Answer: C
