Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the clues given.

The reaction starts with solid A reacting with gas B. They use 8 equivalents of B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. 

Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). Oh, and D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds are based on these reactions. Let's start by assigning possible identities.

So, A is a solid reacting with gas B. Let me think about common reactions. Maybe A is an oxide? Or perhaps a metal?

Wait, when C reacts with water to form A and two acids, that makes me think of a metal oxide reacting with water. For example, maybe A is a metal, and C is a metal oxide. Let's say A is a metal, like sodium (Na), but I'm not sure yet.

But wait, when A reacts with B, it forms C. Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas to form a compound. For example, metals reacting with O2 to form oxides. But B is a gas, so maybe it's oxygen.

Wait, but the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. That's a lot. If A is, say, sodium (Na), then reacting with O2 would form Na2O or NaO2? Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, and sodium peroxide is Na2O2. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

If it's sodium reacting with O2 to form NaO2, the reaction is:
2 Na + O2 → Na2O2.

But that's a 2:1 ratio. Here, B is used in 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe another scenario.

Wait, another possibility: A is carbon (solid), and B is oxygen. Then, carbon reacting with O2 in excess could form CO2. But carbon is a solid, and O2 is a gas. The reaction would be C + O2 → CO2. But the stoichiometry would be 1:1, so 8 equivalents don't fit. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacting with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. But again, the stoichiometry doesn't seem to fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe B is another gas, not O2. How about chlorine gas? So, if A is a metal like sodium, reacting with Cl2 would form NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio for Na and Cl2 to make 2 NaCl. Hmm, 8 equivalents would mean more Cl2 is used, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an oxide, like aluminum oxide. Wait, but aluminum is a metal, so that might not fit.

Wait, let's think about the product C reacting with water to form A and two acids. So C is likely an oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces the metal (A) and some acids.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, then water would react to form a metal hydroxide, but the problem states that it produces two different acids. Hmm, that's confusing because metal oxides typically react with water to form metal hydroxides, which can be basic, not acids. Unless the oxide is of a non-metal.

Wait, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3, which reacts with water to form H2SO4 (a strong acid), and maybe another acid? Wait, no, SO3 only gives H2SO4. Hmm.

Wait, another option: perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to form NaOH and O2. Wait, but that's a base, not acids. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says two different acids F and G. So C must react with water to produce two different acids. That suggests that C is a compound that can form two different acids upon hydrolysis. Maybe a salt that has two different anions, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate? No, because when carbonate reacts with water, it usually forms bicarbonate or CO2 and OH-.

Wait, perhaps C is a diacidic oxide. For example, maybe C is something like P2O5. P2O5 reacts with water to form H3PO4. But that's a single acid, not two. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed oxide. Like, a metal and a non-metal oxide. For instance, perhaps a basic oxide and an acidic oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the reactions with D and B forming H, which is a solvent. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So D and B are in a 1:1 molar ratio.

If H is a solvent, common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. Wait, but D is a gas. So B and D are both gases reacting to form H, which is a liquid (solvent).

Wait, if B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, perhaps H is something like NH3 (since N2 and H2 react in 1:3 ratio to form NH3, but that's not 1:1). Or maybe H is H2O, but B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But O2 and H2 would react in a 1:2 ratio to form H2O.

Wait, another option: H could be CH4? But B and D would have to be C and H2, but that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is CHCl3? No, that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl? No, because HCl is a gas, not a solvent in that context.

Wait, maybe H is NH3. How? If B is N2 and D is H2. The Haber process is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, but that would form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. Wait, but both are gases, and H would be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol (C2H5OH). But then B and D would have to combine to form it. For example, B is CO2 and D is H2. But that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps H is something like CH4O, but I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, maybe I should think of D as a gas that when reacts with B, forms something like HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethylene glycol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about E. The question is about the molecular symmetry of E.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all symmetry groups. Let me think about what each corresponds to.

C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. So a molecule that looks the same after 180-degree rotation.

D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Think of molecules like methane (tetrahedral), but wait, D4h is more like the symmetry of a square planar molecule with a center of inversion. Alternatively, maybe something with a four-membered ring with certain symmetry.

D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a diatomic molecule with a center of symmetry, like O2 or N2. Or maybe a linear molecule with multiple atoms in a line.

C2v: has a 2-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane. Think of something like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry? Wait, actually H2O has D∞h symmetry because it's linear, but wait no, H2O is bent. So its symmetry is C2v. Because it's got a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane. Yes, I think H2O has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So what's E? Let me think about the reactions.

C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to produce E. Also, C reacts with water to give A, F, and G.

Wait, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, when it reacts with water, it forms O2, NaOH, and maybe another product. Wait, no, Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. But that's only one product, not two acids. Hmm. So maybe C isn't a peroxide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible E. If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, going back to the reactions. Let's think about each step.

A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

So, D and B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Wait, if H is a solvent, perhaps H is water (H2O). But then D and B would have to be H2 and O2. Let's see:

H2 + O2 → H2O (with a 2:1 ratio in the reaction 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O). So that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another possibility: H is ethanol (C2H5OH). Then, B and D could be CO2 and H2. But the reaction would be more complex.

Alternatively, H could be NH3. Then, B and D would be N2 and H2. But as before, the Haber process is 1:3, not 1:1.

Wait, maybe H is something like formaldehyde (HCHO). But I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a chlorinated solvent, like CH2Cl2 or CCl4. But then B and D are Cl2 and something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let's think: if D is Cl2 and B is another gas.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction between C and D. C + 2 D → E.

If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxytetrafluoroethylene?), no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas.

Wait, phosgene is OCl2C. No, wait, phosgene is (Cl)2CO, which is Cl2CO.

Wait, but how would C and D react to form that?

Alternatively, maybe E is something like NOCl (nitrosyl chloride), but that's a toxic gas.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me try to think of another approach. Let's think about the possible structure of C.

C is formed by A reacting with 8 equivalents of B. So, perhaps A is a metal in a +1 oxidation state, and B is a -1/2 ion. Hmm, but that's a bit abstract.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is A B4, but wait 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of B per mole of A. So the formula would be A B8? That seems a bit odd.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible compounds that fit the scenario.

When C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid), perhaps the reaction is:

C + H2O → A + F + G.

Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that contains both sulfates and something else. Wait, but that might be stretching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Wait, for example, if C is CaCO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Maybe if C is a more complex salt.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a nitrated compound? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water produces a strong acid and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something similar.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structure of E. The molecular symmetry group options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has D4h symmetry, that's a high level of symmetry, like a square planar molecule or something like that. But D4h is a point group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes.

Alternatively, D∞h would be a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like O2, HCN, etc.

Wait, but the options are possible, so perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which would make sense if E is a diatomic gas.

Wait, if E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2, but those are not extremely hazardous, though Cl2 is dangerous.

Another diatomic could be HCl, but that's a gas, not extremely hazardous? Or perhaps HCN, which is a linear molecule (so D∞h symmetry) and is extremely toxic.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, yes.

So, if E is HCN, then what is C?

C is the product of A reacting with B in 8 equivalents. Let's see: HCN is produced when something reacts with another gas.

Wait, HCN can be produced by the reaction of CH4 with Cl2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, HCN is produced when a cyanide salt reacts with an acid. But that's a different context.

Wait, perhaps C is (CN)2, or another cyanide compound.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me think again.

If E is HCN, then in the reaction C + 2 D → HCN.

What would C and D be?

Wait, if D is H2 and B is CN-? No, because B is a gas. Wait, maybe B is another gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3CN (acetonitrile), but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, maybe C is (CN)2? Let me think: (CN)2 is dicyanide, which is a gas. So if C is (CN)2, then reacting with D (maybe H2) in 2 equivalents would form HCN.

Wait, the reaction would be (CN)2 + 2 H2 → 2 HCN + something? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe (CN)2 reacts with H2 to form 2 HCN and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2, and when (CN)2 reacts with H2, it produces HCN. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaCN, but that's a solid, not a bright red product.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas. Wait, but C is a product of a solid (A) reacting with gas B (8 equivalents). So maybe A is something that reacts with B to form NO2.

Wait, for example, if A is Ag and B is NO. But Ag + NO might not form NO2 directly. Alternatively, maybe A is copper and B is concentrated nitric acid, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is NaNO2, and B is Cl2. But that might form some product.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me think about the possible structure of E, considering the symmetry groups.

Symmetry groups:

A) C2: a molecule that can be rotated 180 degrees and look the same. Examples: H2O (but H2O is C2v), O=C=S (thiocyanate ion) is C2.

B) D4h: High symmetry, like square planar complexes, or molecules like SO4^2- (but that's tetrahedral). Alternatively, something with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirrors.

C) D∞h: Linear molecule with multiple atoms, like O2, HCN, CO.

D) C2v: Has a C2 axis and a vertical mirror plane. H2O has this, as does CO2 (which is linear, but CO2 is D∞h because it's linear and has multiple mirror planes).

Wait, CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear and has an infinite number of symmetry operations. But wait, H2O is bent, so it has C2v symmetry.

So if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, perhaps it's something like O2, HCN, CO, NO, etc.

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. So O2 isn't that dangerous, but HCN is. CO is toxic, but maybe not in the same way. NO is also very toxic.

So if E is HCN, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, E could be Cl2, but Cl2 has D∞h symmetry as well.

Wait, but the question is about E's symmetry group.

So, if I'm thinking E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But wait, let me think again about the reactions.

C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to form E. If E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN.

What could C and D be?

If D is H2, then C would be something that reacts with H2 to form HCN. Maybe C is (CN)2.

(CN)2 (dicyanide) + 2 H2 → 2 HCN.

But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas.

Alternatively, if C is NaCN and D is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

If H is a solvent, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, D and B would be gases that react in 1:1 ratio to form ethanol.

But ethanol is C2H5OH, so the reaction would be something like CO2 + 2 H2 → CH3CH2OH, but that's more like Fischer-Tropsch process, which isn't 1:1.

Alternatively, H could be methanol (CH3OH). The reaction of CO2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio would form CH3OH, but again, not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is CO and B is H2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, they would form something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.

Let me think about the possible products and their properties.

When C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a sulfite or something that produces a strong and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is NaHSO4, but when it reacts with water, it would only produce H2SO4 and NaOH, which are a strong acid and a strong base. Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility: if C is a mixed salt, like NaHSO3. When it reacts with water, it might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). But that's a base and an acid. Wait, but the problem says F and G are acids. So Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. So, CO2 is an acid (weak), and NaOH is a base. But the problem says F and G are acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a base. Again, only one acid, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe C is a diacid, like H2SO4. But then, when it reacts with water, it just stays as H2SO4. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a weak acid and a strong acid. Like, for example, if C is PbO2, which reacts with water to form PbO2 (which decomposes further?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 is a liquid, but C is a product of A and B; maybe A is O2 and B is H2. But then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that would form water, not H2O2.

Hmm, perhaps C is something like Na2O2. Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. So that would produce NaOH (strong base) and O2 (a gas, which is a weak acid in water). But the problem says F and G are acids. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a complex oxide. For example, if C is something like CaCO3·2H2O, but that's more about hydrates.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfate, like Fe2(SO4)3. Reacting with water wouldn't change much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that contains both nitrate and nitrite ions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't decompose, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and something else. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me think about E and its possible structure.

If E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2, HCN, or CO, then the symmetry group would be D∞h. So, option C is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is V-shaped (like H2O), its symmetry group would be C2v. But SO2 is a trigonal planar molecule, but wait, no—SO2 is bent, so it's V-shaped, which would have C2v symmetry.

Wait, but the options don't have C2v as the correct one for E. Wait, let me recheck the options.

Options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v (option D). But SO2 isn't extremely hazardous, but it's harmful.

Wait, but the problem states E is extremely hazardous. So what about phosgene (Cl2CO)? Phosgene is a toxic gas, and its structure is linear: O=C=Cl2 (wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2. So, structure is O=C=Cl2? No, wait, phosgene is Cl2C=O, which is a linear molecule. So, it has D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is D∞h, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, how would C and D react to form E?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, under specific conditions. So, perhaps C is CO and D is Cl2.

But in the reaction, C + 2 D → E.

So, if C is CO and D is Cl2, then CO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2C=O (phosgene). But wait, the reaction would actually be CO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2C=O, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, if C is (Cl)2CO, that's phosgene itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated compound that reacts with another gas to form phosgene.

Wait, perhaps C is CHCl3. Then, reacting with O2 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate that reacts with HCl to produce CO2 and Cl−, but that's not matching the reaction.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), which is a very dangerous gas, but I'm not sure about its structure. Cl2O7 is a linear molecule, O in the center with two Cl on each side? No, Cl2O7 has a structure where each oxygen is connected to two Cl atoms. Wait, Cl2O7 is a cyclic structure, I think. So, it's a ring, which would have D6h symmetry, not D∞h. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the most likely scenario.

Given that E is a product of C and D, and C is a bright red product, perhaps C is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas.

If C is NO2, then reacting with D (2 equivalents) to form E.

What reacts with NO2 to form something else? For example, NO2 can react with water to form HNO3 and NO, but that's in the presence of H2O, not another gas.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with H2 to form HNO and H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with NH3 to form nitrosylamine (NNOH), but that's a different context.

Alternatively, perhaps E is N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), but that's a white crystalline substance, I think.

Hmm, another possibility: E is NO (nitric oxide), which is a colorless gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts; it can be harmful.

Wait, perhaps E is NOCl (nitrosyl chloride), which is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about its structure.

Alternatively, E could be ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a yellow-green gas, and it's used as a strong oxidizing agent and is toxic.

ClO2 has a bent structure (like O3), so its symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

So, if E is ClO2, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be option D.

But how does C and D react to form E?

ClO2 can be produced from NaClO3 and HCl under certain conditions. But that's not involving gases reacting with another gas.

Wait, maybe C is ClO2 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO and D is O2. ClO is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the product C is bright red. So, the most likely bright red product is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas. So, C is NO2.

Then, when C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, what reacts with NO2 to form a dangerous product?

One possibility is that NO2 reacts with O3 (ozone) to form something, but not sure.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with Cl2 to form NOCl and ClNO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2. So, reaction: NO2 + 2 Cl2 → ?

If that forms something like ClNO3, which is a strong acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps NO2 reacts with H2O to form HNO3 and NO, but that's when H2O is involved, not another gas.

Hmm, perhaps E is something like HNO3, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about E and its possible symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, it has D∞h symmetry. If E is HCN, also D∞h.

But if E is a bent molecule like H2O, it has C2v symmetry.

So, given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a diatomic gas like HCN or Cl2, which have D∞h symmetry.

So, if E's symmetry group is D∞h, the answer is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think D∞h is the most likely.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction Analysis**:  
   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.  
   - C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it could be nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a red-brown gas.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases like phosgene (COCl₂) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN).  
   - The reaction between C and D to form E implies a transformation involving a gas.  
   - The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure.

3. **Symmetry Group Analysis**:  
   - **C2**: A molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis. This symmetry is unlikely for E, as it does not match the properties of highly hazardous gases like phosgene or HCN.  
   - **D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes. This is characteristic of square planar or certain tetrahedral molecules, which does not align with the expected structure of E.  
   - **D∞h**: A symmetry group for linear molecules with an infinite axis of rotation, such as diatomic gases like HCN, CO, or Cl₂. These are consistent with the structure of highly hazardous gases.  
   - **C2v**: A symmetry group for bent molecules with a C2 axis and vertical mirror planes, like H₂O or SO₂. While SO₂ is toxic, it is not as extreme as E.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the description of E as extremely hazardous and its likely molecular structure, E is most consistent with a linear molecule like phosgene (COCl₂) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN), both of which have **D∞h** symmetry.  

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the clues given.

The reaction starts with solid A reacting with gas B. They use 8 equivalents of B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. 

Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). Oh, and D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds are based on these reactions. Let's start by assigning possible identities.

So, A is a solid reacting with gas B. Let me think about common reactions. Maybe A is an oxide? Or perhaps a metal?

Wait, when C reacts with water to form A and two acids, that makes me think of a metal oxide reacting with water. For example, maybe A is a metal, and C is a metal oxide. Let's say A is a metal, like sodium (Na), but I'm not sure yet.

But wait, when A reacts with B, it forms C. Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas to form a compound. For example, metals reacting with O2 to form oxides. But B is a gas, so maybe it's oxygen.

Wait, but the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. That's a lot. If A is, say, sodium (Na), then reacting with O2 would form Na2O or NaO2? Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, and sodium peroxide is Na2O2. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

If it's sodium reacting with O2 to form NaO2, the reaction is:
2 Na + O2 → Na2O2.

But that's a 2:1 ratio. Here, B is used in 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe another scenario.

Wait, another possibility: A is carbon (solid), and B is oxygen. Then, carbon reacting with O2 in excess could form CO2. But carbon is a solid, and O2 is a gas. The reaction would be C + O2 → CO2. But the stoichiometry would be 1:1, so 8 equivalents don't fit. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacting with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. But again, the stoichiometry doesn't seem to fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe B is another gas, not O2. How about chlorine gas? So, if A is a metal like sodium, reacting with Cl2 would form NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio for Na and Cl2 to make 2 NaCl. Hmm, 8 equivalents would mean more Cl2 is used, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an oxide, like aluminum oxide. Wait, but aluminum is a metal, so that might not fit.

Wait, let's think about the product C reacting with water to form A and two acids. So C is likely an oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces the metal (A) and some acids.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, then water would react to form a metal hydroxide, but the problem states that it produces two different acids. Hmm, that's confusing because metal oxides typically react with water to form metal hydroxides, which can be basic, not acids. Unless the oxide is of a non-metal.

Wait, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3, which reacts with water to form H2SO4 (a strong acid), and maybe another acid? Wait, no, SO3 only gives H2SO4. Hmm.

Wait, another option: perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to form NaOH and O2. Wait, but that's a base, not acids. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says two different acids F and G. So C must react with water to produce two different acids. That suggests that C is a compound that can form two different acids upon hydrolysis. Maybe a salt that has two different anions, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate? No, because when carbonate reacts with water, it usually forms bicarbonate or CO2 and OH-.

Wait, perhaps C is a diacidic oxide. For example, maybe C is something like P2O5. P2O5 reacts with water to form H3PO4. But that's a single acid, not two. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed oxide. Like, a metal and a non-metal oxide. For instance, perhaps a basic oxide and an acidic oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the reactions with D and B forming H, which is a solvent. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So D and B are in a 1:1 molar ratio.

If H is a solvent, common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. Wait, but D is a gas. So B and D are both gases reacting to form H, which is a liquid (solvent).

Wait, if B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, perhaps H is something like NH3 (since N2 and H2 react in 1:3 ratio to form NH3, but that's not 1:1). Or maybe H is H2O, but B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But O2 and H2 would react in a 1:2 ratio to form H2O.

Wait, another option: H could be CH4? But B and D would have to be C and H2, but that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is CHCl3? No, that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl? No, because HCl is a gas, not a solvent in that context.

Wait, maybe H is NH3. How? If B is N2 and D is H2. The Haber process is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, but that would form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. Wait, but both are gases, and H would be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol (C2H5OH). But then B and D would have to combine to form it. For example, B is CO2 and D is H2. But that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps H is something like CH4O, but I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, maybe I should think of D as a gas that when reacts with B, forms something like HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethylene glycol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about E. The question is about the molecular symmetry of E.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all symmetry groups. Let me think about what each corresponds to.

C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. So a molecule that looks the same after 180-degree rotation.

D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Think of molecules like methane (tetrahedral), but wait, D4h is more like the symmetry of a square planar molecule with a center of inversion. Alternatively, maybe something with a four-membered ring with certain symmetry.

D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a diatomic molecule with a center of symmetry, like O2 or N2. Or maybe a linear molecule with multiple atoms in a line.

C2v: has a 2-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane. Think of something like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry? Wait, actually H2O has D∞h symmetry because it's linear, but wait no, H2O is bent. So its symmetry is C2v. Because it's got a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane. Yes, I think H2O has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So what's E? Let me think about the reactions.

C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to produce E. Also, C reacts with water to give A, F, and G.

Wait, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, when it reacts with water, it forms O2, NaOH, and maybe another product. Wait, no, Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. But that's only one product, not two acids. Hmm. So maybe C isn't a peroxide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible E. If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, going back to the reactions. Let's think about each step.

A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

So, D and B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Wait, if H is a solvent, perhaps H is water (H2O). But then D and B would have to be H2 and O2. Let's see:

H2 + O2 → H2O (with a 2:1 ratio in the reaction 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O). So that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another possibility: H is ethanol (C2H5OH). Then, B and D could be CO2 and H2. But the reaction would be more complex.

Alternatively, H could be NH3. Then, B and D would be N2 and H2. But as before, the Haber process is 1:3, not 1:1.

Wait, maybe H is something like formaldehyde (HCHO). But I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a chlorinated solvent, like CH2Cl2 or CCl4. But then B and D are Cl2 and something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let's think: if D is Cl2 and B is another gas.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction between C and D. C + 2 D → E.

If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxytetrafluoroethylene?), no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas.

Wait, phosgene is OCl2C. No, wait, phosgene is (Cl)2CO, which is Cl2CO.

Wait, but how would C and D react to form that?

Alternatively, maybe E is something like NOCl (nitrosyl chloride), but that's a toxic gas.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me try to think of another approach. Let's think about the possible structure of C.

C is formed by A reacting with 8 equivalents of B. So, perhaps A is a metal in a +1 oxidation state, and B is a -1/2 ion. Hmm, but that's a bit abstract.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is A B4, but wait 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of B per mole of A. So the formula would be A B8? That seems a bit odd.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible compounds that fit the scenario.

When C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid), perhaps the reaction is:

C + H2O → A + F + G.

Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that contains both sulfates and something else. Wait, but that might be stretching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Wait, for example, if C is CaCO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Maybe if C is a more complex salt.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a nitrated compound? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water produces a strong acid and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something similar.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structure of E. The molecular symmetry group options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has D4h symmetry, that's a high level of symmetry, like a square planar molecule or something like that. But D4h is a point group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes.

Alternatively, D∞h would be a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like O2, HCN, etc.

Wait, but the options are possible, so perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which would make sense if E is a diatomic gas.

Wait, if E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2, but those are not extremely hazardous, though Cl2 is dangerous.

Another diatomic could be HCl, but that's a gas, not extremely hazardous? Or perhaps HCN, which is a linear molecule (so D∞h symmetry) and is extremely toxic.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, yes.

So, if E is HCN, then what is C?

C is the product of A reacting with B in 8 equivalents. Let's see: HCN is produced when something reacts with another gas.

Wait, HCN can be produced by the reaction of CH4 with Cl2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, HCN is produced when a cyanide salt reacts with an acid. But that's a different context.

Wait, perhaps C is (CN)2, or another cyanide compound.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me think again.

If E is HCN, then in the reaction C + 2 D → HCN.

What would C and D be?

Wait, if D is H2 and B is CN-? No, because B is a gas. Wait, maybe B is another gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3CN (acetonitrile), but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, maybe C is (CN)2? Let me think: (CN)2 is dicyanide, which is a gas. So if C is (CN)2, then reacting with D (maybe H2) in 2 equivalents would form HCN.

Wait, the reaction would be (CN)2 + 2 H2 → 2 HCN + something? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe (CN)2 reacts with H2 to form 2 HCN and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2, and when (CN)2 reacts with H2, it produces HCN. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaCN, but that's a solid, not a bright red product.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas. Wait, but C is a product of a solid (A) reacting with gas B (8 equivalents). So maybe A is something that reacts with B to form NO2.

Wait, for example, if A is Ag and B is NO. But Ag + NO might not form NO2 directly. Alternatively, maybe A is copper and B is concentrated nitric acid, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is NaNO2, and B is Cl2. But that might form some product.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me think about the possible structure of E, considering the symmetry groups.

Symmetry groups:

A) C2: a molecule that can be rotated 180 degrees and look the same. Examples: H2O (but H2O is C2v), O=C=S (thiocyanate ion) is C2.

B) D4h: High symmetry, like square planar complexes, or molecules like SO4^2- (but that's tetrahedral). Alternatively, something with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirrors.

C) D∞h: Linear molecule with multiple atoms, like O2, HCN, CO.

D) C2v: Has a C2 axis and a vertical mirror plane. H2O has this, as does CO2 (which is linear, but CO2 is D∞h because it's linear and has multiple mirror planes).

Wait, CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear and has an infinite number of symmetry operations. But wait, H2O is bent, so it has C2v symmetry.

So if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, perhaps it's something like O2, HCN, CO, NO, etc.

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. So O2 isn't that dangerous, but HCN is. CO is toxic, but maybe not in the same way. NO is also very toxic.

So if E is HCN, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, E could be Cl2, but Cl2 has D∞h symmetry as well.

Wait, but the question is about E's symmetry group.

So, if I'm thinking E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But wait, let me think again about the reactions.

C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to form E. If E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN.

What could C and D be?

If D is H2, then C would be something that reacts with H2 to form HCN. Maybe C is (CN)2.

(CN)2 (dicyanide) + 2 H2 → 2 HCN.

But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas.

Alternatively, if C is NaCN and D is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

If H is a solvent, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, D and B would be gases that react in 1:1 ratio to form ethanol.

But ethanol is C2H5OH, so the reaction would be something like CO2 + 2 H2 → CH3CH2OH, but that's more like Fischer-Tropsch process, which isn't 1:1.

Alternatively, H could be methanol (CH3OH). The reaction of CO2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio would form CH3OH, but again, not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is CO and B is H2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, they would form something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to be O2 and H2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.

Let me think about the possible products and their properties.

When C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a sulfite or something that produces a strong and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is NaHSO4, but when it reacts with water, it would only produce H2SO4 and NaOH, which are a strong acid and a strong base. Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility: if C is a mixed salt, like NaHSO3. When it reacts with water, it might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). But that's a base and an acid. Wait, but the problem says F and G are acids. So Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. So, CO2 is an acid (weak), and NaOH is a base. But the problem says F and G are acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a base. Again, only one acid, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe C is a diacid, like H2SO4. But then, when it reacts with water, it just stays as H2SO4. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a weak acid and a strong acid. Like, for example, if C is PbO2, which reacts with water to form PbO2 (which decomposes further?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 is a liquid, but C is a product of A and B; maybe A is O2 and B is H2. But then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that would form water, not H2O2.

Hmm, perhaps C is something like Na2O2. Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. So that would produce NaOH (strong base) and O2 (a gas, which is a weak acid in water). But the problem says F and G are acids. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a complex oxide. For example, if C is something like CaCO3·2H2O, but that's more about hydrates.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfate, like Fe2(SO4)3. Reacting with water wouldn't change much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that contains both nitrate and nitrite ions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't decompose, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and something else. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me think about E and its possible structure.

If E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2, HCN, or CO, then the symmetry group would be D∞h. So, option C is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is V-shaped (like H2O), its symmetry group would be C2v. But SO2 is a trigonal planar molecule, but wait, no—SO2 is bent, so it's V-shaped, which would have C2v symmetry.

Wait, but the options don't have C2v as the correct one for E. Wait, let me recheck the options.

Options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v (option D). But SO2 isn't extremely hazardous, but it's harmful.

Wait, but the problem states E is extremely hazardous. So what about phosgene (Cl2CO)? Phosgene is a toxic gas, and its structure is linear: O=C=Cl2 (wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2. So, structure is O=C=Cl2? No, wait, phosgene is Cl2C=O, which is a linear molecule. So, it has D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is D∞h, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, how would C and D react to form E?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, under specific conditions. So, perhaps C is CO and D is Cl2.

But in the reaction, C + 2 D → E.

So, if C is CO and D is Cl2, then CO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2C=O (phosgene). But wait, the reaction would actually be CO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2C=O, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, if C is (Cl)2CO, that's phosgene itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated compound that reacts with another gas to form phosgene.

Wait, perhaps C is CHCl3. Then, reacting with O2 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate that reacts with HCl to produce CO2 and Cl−, but that's not matching the reaction.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), which is a very dangerous gas, but I'm not sure about its structure. Cl2O7 is a linear molecule, O in the center with two Cl on each side? No, Cl2O7 has a structure where each oxygen is connected to two Cl atoms. Wait, Cl2O7 is a cyclic structure, I think. So, it's a ring, which would have D6h symmetry, not D∞h. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the most likely scenario.

Given that E is a product of C and D, and C is a bright red product, perhaps C is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas.

If C is NO2, then reacting with D (2 equivalents) to form E.

What reacts with NO2 to form something else? For example, NO2 can react with water to form HNO3 and NO, but that's in the presence of H2O, not another gas.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with H2 to form HNO and H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with NH3 to form nitrosylamine (NNOH), but that's a different context.

Alternatively, perhaps E is N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), but that's a white crystalline substance, I think.

Hmm, another possibility: E is NO (nitric oxide), which is a colorless gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts; it can be harmful.

Wait, perhaps E is NOCl (nitrosyl chloride), which is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about its structure.

Alternatively, E could be ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a yellow-green gas, and it's used as a strong oxidizing agent and is toxic.

ClO2 has a bent structure (like O3), so its symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

So, if E is ClO2, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be option D.

But how does C and D react to form E?

ClO2 can be produced from NaClO3 and HCl under certain conditions. But that's not involving gases reacting with another gas.

Wait, maybe C is ClO2 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO and D is O2. ClO is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the product C is bright red. So, the most likely bright red product is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas. So, C is NO2.

Then, when C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, what reacts with NO2 to form a dangerous product?

One possibility is that NO2 reacts with O3 (ozone) to form something, but not sure.

Alternatively, NO2 can react with Cl2 to form NOCl and ClNO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2. So, reaction: NO2 + 2 Cl2 → ?

If that forms something like ClNO3, which is a strong acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps NO2 reacts with H2O to form HNO3 and NO, but that's when H2O is involved, not another gas.

Hmm, perhaps E is something like HNO3, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about E and its possible symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, it has D∞h symmetry. If E is HCN, also D∞h.

But if E is a bent molecule like H2O, it has C2v symmetry.

So, given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a diatomic gas like HCN or Cl2, which have D∞h symmetry.

So, if E's symmetry group is D∞h, the answer is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think D∞h is the most likely.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction Analysis**:  
   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.  
   - C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it could be nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a red-brown gas.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases like phosgene (COCl₂) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN).  
   - The reaction between C and D to form E implies a transformation involving a gas.  
   - The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure.

3. **Symmetry Group Analysis**:  
   - **C2**: A molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis. This symmetry is unlikely for E, as it does not match the properties of highly hazardous gases like phosgene or HCN.  
   - **D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes. This is characteristic of square planar or certain tetrahedral molecules, which does not align with the expected structure of E.  
   - **D∞h**: A symmetry group for linear molecules with an infinite axis of rotation, such as diatomic gases like HCN, CO, or Cl₂. These are consistent with the structure of highly hazardous gases.  
   - **C2v**: A symmetry group for bent molecules with a C2 axis and vertical mirror planes, like H₂O or SO₂. While SO₂ is toxic, it is not as extreme as E.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the description of E as extremely hazardous and its likely molecular structure, E is most consistent with a linear molecule like phosgene (COCl₂) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN), both of which have **D∞h** symmetry.  

ANSWER: C
