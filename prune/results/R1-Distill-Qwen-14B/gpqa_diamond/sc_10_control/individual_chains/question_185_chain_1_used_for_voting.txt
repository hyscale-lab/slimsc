Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems.

Wait, the Pauli spin matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right? So σ · n would be the dot product, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, I think that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So maybe the product or sum would relate to that.

Wait, no, actually, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But here, the Hamiltonian is a combination of them. Let's think about the general properties. The operator σ · n is a vector operator, and when you take its eigenvalues, that should correspond to the spin in the direction of n.

Oh right! For a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S · n would be ± ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. So if I factor out the constants, H would be similar to S · n multiplied by 2ε / ħ.

Wait, no, let me think. Let me write it out. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So σ = 2 S / ħ. Therefore, H = ε (σ · n) = ε (2 S · n) / ħ. So H = (2 ε / ħ) (S · n).

But wait, the eigenvalues of S · n are ± ħ/2, right? So substituting that into H, the eigenvalues would be (2 ε / ħ)(± ħ/2 ) = ± ε. Because 2/ħ multiplied by ħ/2 is 1. So each eigenvalue is ± ε.

Wait, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B is plus and minus ε. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another approach: the eigenvalues of σ · n can be found by considering that σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. The trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. The determinant would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2? Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, the eigenvalues of a matrix like σ · n would be ±1, because the trace is zero and the determinant is -1. Because (σ · n)^2 = I, so the eigenvalues squared are 1, so eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, that's another way to see it. So if (σ · n)^2 = I, then the eigenvalues are ±1. So the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by that, so H would have eigenvalues ± ε. So that confirms it. So option B is correct.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To determine the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the properties of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\), and the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are also \(\pm 1\) because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. This can be confirmed by noting that \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix, ensuring that the eigenvalues squared are \(1\), and thus the eigenvalues themselves are \(\pm 1\).

Since \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are simply \(\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\), as the constant \(\varepsilon\) scales the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as shown above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar/2\).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).
