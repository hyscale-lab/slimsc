Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r,θ) given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, sometimes it's helpful to separate the variables and see if the system is separable. The potential here depends on r and θ, which are polar coordinates. So maybe I should express the problem in polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So I can factor out (1/2)kr². Let me see: that's (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it again. The original terms are (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So adding them together gives (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) kr². Oh, right, because (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) multiplied by kr².

But wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of some angular part and radial part. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So that's (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, 3 cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Because cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ -1, so cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me substitute that in.

So 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 = (3/2)(1 + cos(2θ)). So the potential becomes (1/2)kr² [1 + (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ)]. Wait, let me compute that correctly. Wait, no: the original potential is V = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). So substituting cos²θ, it becomes (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²)*( (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ). Let me compute that: 3/2 * 1/2 is 3/4, so it's (1/2 + 3/4) kr² plus (3/4) kr² cos(2θ).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me redo that. The potential is V = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos 2θ)/2 into the second term: (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire potential is V = [ (1/2) kr² ] + [ (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ) ]

Let me combine the terms: 1/2 kr² + 3/4 kr² (1) is (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². And the other term is (3/4) kr² cos 2θ. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think about whether this potential is separable or if there's a coordinate transformation that can make it easier. Or perhaps it's a form that can be expressed in terms of a known potential, like the harmonic oscillator.

Wait, I remember that for a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², and the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers. But our potential here is more complicated because it has an angular dependence.

Wait, but perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of r and another variable, maybe involving θ. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be expressed as a combination of a radial term and an angular term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a shifted harmonic oscillator potential.

Wait, let me see. The potential we have is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let's factor out (1/2) kr². Wait, that would give (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + 3 ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) ) because cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, 1 + 3*(1+cos2θ)/2 = [2 + 3(1 + cos2θ)] / 2 = [2 +3 +3 cos2θ ] /2 = (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2. So V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential as a sum of a radial part and a rotational part. Wait, in some cases, potentials can be expressed as V(r) + W(θ), which would allow the problem to be separated into radial and angular parts. But in this case, V(r,θ) includes both r² and r² cos²θ terms, so it's not purely radial or angular. So maybe we need to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, sometimes transforming to Cartesian can make the potential separable.

So, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr^2 (x²/r²) ). Simplifying that, the x² term in the second part is multiplied by (3/2) kr^2 * (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². So V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Because r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute this: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 +3/2)k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = (2k x²) + ( (1/2)k y² )

So the potential becomes V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's a sum of two different harmonic oscillators in x and y. Because each term is a quadratic function of x and y respectively.

In that case, the potential is separable into x and y parts. So the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, because in Cartesian coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p_x^2 + p_y^2)/(2m), and the potential is 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So, the system is separable into x and y directions. Each direction has its own harmonic oscillator potential.

So for the x-direction: the potential is 2k x². So the effective "spring constant" for x is 2k. The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). Wait, no, wait: the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m) for a standard harmonic oscillator with potential (1/2)k x^2. But in our case, the potential is 2k x², which is (1/2)(4k) x². So the effective k is 4k. Oh wait, no: the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So in our case, the potential is (2k) x² = (1/2) (4k) x². So ω_x^2 = (4k)/m, so ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction: the potential is (1/2)k y², which is the standard form. So the angular frequency ω_y for y is sqrt(k/m).

So each direction contributes to the energy. The total energy would be the sum of the energies from x and y directions.

In the x direction, the energy levels are E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m).

In the y direction, energy levels are E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E is E_x + E_y.

Let me compute E in terms of n_x and n_y.

E = (n_x + 1/2)*2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ (2(n_x + 1/2)) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me expand the terms inside:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Now, looking at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m).

So that's matching. The other options don't have this combination. Let me double-check the options:

Option A: 2n_x +3n_y +1/2 — nope, because in the y-direction, the coefficient is 1, not 3.

Option B: n_x +3n_y +3/2 — doesn't match, as x has 2n_x and y n_y.

Option C: correct.

Option D: 3n_x +2n_y +1/2 — nope.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To determine the energy spectrum, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \). Substituting these into the potential gives:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \). The angular frequencies for the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions are:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy levels for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are \( E_n = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \). For the \( x \)-direction, the energy levels are:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\frac{\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

For the \( y \)-direction, the energy levels are:

\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\frac{\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying and factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

The other options do not match the derived energy spectrum.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r,θ) given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, sometimes it's helpful to separate the variables and see if the system is separable. The potential here depends on r and θ, which are polar coordinates. So maybe I should express the problem in polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So I can factor out (1/2)kr². Let me see: that's (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it again. The original terms are (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So adding them together gives (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) kr². Oh, right, because (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) multiplied by kr².

But wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of some angular part and radial part. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So that's (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, 3 cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Because cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ -1, so cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me substitute that in.

So 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 = (3/2)(1 + cos(2θ)). So the potential becomes (1/2)kr² [1 + (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ)]. Wait, let me compute that correctly. Wait, no: the original potential is V = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). So substituting cos²θ, it becomes (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²)*( (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ). Let me compute that: 3/2 * 1/2 is 3/4, so it's (1/2 + 3/4) kr² plus (3/4) kr² cos(2θ).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me redo that. The potential is V = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos 2θ)/2 into the second term: (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire potential is V = [ (1/2) kr² ] + [ (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ) ]

Let me combine the terms: 1/2 kr² + 3/4 kr² (1) is (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². And the other term is (3/4) kr² cos 2θ. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think about whether this potential is separable or if there's a coordinate transformation that can make it easier. Or perhaps it's a form that can be expressed in terms of a known potential, like the harmonic oscillator.

Wait, I remember that for a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², and the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers. But our potential here is more complicated because it has an angular dependence.

Wait, but perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of r and another variable, maybe involving θ. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be expressed as a combination of a radial term and an angular term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a shifted harmonic oscillator potential.

Wait, let me see. The potential we have is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let's factor out (1/2) kr². Wait, that would give (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + 3 ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) ) because cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, 1 + 3*(1+cos2θ)/2 = [2 + 3(1 + cos2θ)] / 2 = [2 +3 +3 cos2θ ] /2 = (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2. So V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential as a sum of a radial part and a rotational part. Wait, in some cases, potentials can be expressed as V(r) + W(θ), which would allow the problem to be separated into radial and angular parts. But in this case, V(r,θ) includes both r² and r² cos²θ terms, so it's not purely radial or angular. So maybe we need to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, sometimes transforming to Cartesian can make the potential separable.

So, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr^2 (x²/r²) ). Simplifying that, the x² term in the second part is multiplied by (3/2) kr^2 * (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². So V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Because r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute this: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 +3/2)k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = (2k x²) + ( (1/2)k y² )

So the potential becomes V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's a sum of two different harmonic oscillators in x and y. Because each term is a quadratic function of x and y respectively.

In that case, the potential is separable into x and y parts. So the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, because in Cartesian coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p_x^2 + p_y^2)/(2m), and the potential is 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So, the system is separable into x and y directions. Each direction has its own harmonic oscillator potential.

So for the x-direction: the potential is 2k x². So the effective "spring constant" for x is 2k. The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). Wait, no, wait: the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m) for a standard harmonic oscillator with potential (1/2)k x^2. But in our case, the potential is 2k x², which is (1/2)(4k) x². So the effective k is 4k. Oh wait, no: the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So in our case, the potential is (2k) x² = (1/2) (4k) x². So ω_x^2 = (4k)/m, so ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction: the potential is (1/2)k y², which is the standard form. So the angular frequency ω_y for y is sqrt(k/m).

So each direction contributes to the energy. The total energy would be the sum of the energies from x and y directions.

In the x direction, the energy levels are E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m).

In the y direction, energy levels are E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E is E_x + E_y.

Let me compute E in terms of n_x and n_y.

E = (n_x + 1/2)*2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ (2(n_x + 1/2)) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me expand the terms inside:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Now, looking at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m).

So that's matching. The other options don't have this combination. Let me double-check the options:

Option A: 2n_x +3n_y +1/2 — nope, because in the y-direction, the coefficient is 1, not 3.

Option B: n_x +3n_y +3/2 — doesn't match, as x has 2n_x and y n_y.

Option C: correct.

Option D: 3n_x +2n_y +1/2 — nope.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To determine the energy spectrum, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \). Substituting these into the potential gives:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \). The angular frequencies for the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions are:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy levels for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are \( E_n = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \). For the \( x \)-direction, the energy levels are:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\frac{\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

For the \( y \)-direction, the energy levels are:

\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\frac{\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying and factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

The other options do not match the derived energy spectrum. 

Answer: C
