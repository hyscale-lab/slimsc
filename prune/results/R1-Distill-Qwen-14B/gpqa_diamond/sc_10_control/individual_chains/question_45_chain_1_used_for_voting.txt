Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in the nth level is given by E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Wait, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, because they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. But since they're in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n. However, each particle also has a spin quantum number, which can be either up or down. 

So each state in the well can be occupied by two particles with opposite spins. But wait, in this scenario, since it's a one-dimensional well, each energy level can have a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and another with spin down. So for each n, you can have two particles.

Now, the system is four particles. Let's think about how they fill the energy levels. The ground state would be the lowest energy possible. The first excited state is the next lowest, and the second excited state is the next one up.

In the ground state, we need to fill the lowest possible energy levels with the four particles. Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E
n=2: E_2 = 4 E
n=3: 9 E
n=4: 16 E
n=5:25 E
... and so on.

But since each n can hold two particles, let's see how four particles fill this.

For four particles:
- The first two particles will go into n=1, each with opposite spins. So that's two particles in n=1.
- The next two can't both go into n=2 because that would require four particles, but each n can only take two. Wait, no—each n can take two particles, so for each n, it's two. So second level (n=2) holds two particles. So the first four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So with four particles, two will go into n=1 (spin up and down) and two will go into n=2 (spin up and down). So the ground state is when all four are filled with the lowest possible n's.

Wait, but wait another thing: the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. So for the ground state, two particles are at n=1 and two at n=2.

So energy of ground state is (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Or wait, no, wait—each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two would be 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, so two is 8E. So total is 10E. 

Wait, but wait—the question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So let me clarify the arrangement of the particles.

In the ground state, the four particles will fill the lowest available orbitals with maximum possible spin multiplicity. Since each n can hold two, we have:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but what about the next states, the excited states? Let's think about the first excited state. The first excited state would be the next higher energy configuration. So which orbital would change?

Wait no, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state would have the next possible energy, which is when one of the particles moves to the next higher energy level. But in this case, because spin is involved, perhaps I should think about the orderings.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible states as filled shells and then find the next possible state where the highest particle moves up. Alternatively, perhaps each particle is considered as filling the lowest possible states.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy levels are filled as follows:

Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So the first two particles go into n=1, each with spin up and down. The next two go into n=2 with spin up and down. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the energy is 2*(1E + 4E) = 10E.

Wait, but that's the ground state. Now, for the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles from n=2 moves up to n=3? But wait, no. Because each state is filled with the lowest possible energy. So the first excited state would be when the highest particle moves to the next available state.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but since each n can hold two, perhaps that's not the case. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait another approach: the possible energy levels are filled in order. So the ground state has the lowest possible energies. The first excited state is the next possible configuration.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. So the energy is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 10E.

The first excited state would then involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but how? Because each n can hold two, perhaps the configuration becomes n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). But wait, no, because for identical particles, each n can hold two. So if a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, perhaps the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). But wait, each n can have two, so n=2 can have one or two. Hmm—wait, maybe the first excited state would have the same number of particles in lower levels but with some promotion.

Wait, maybe I should list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The possible states are filled in the order of their energy. The ground state is the lowest possible.

The ground state would have the four particles in the lowest two energy levels: n=1 and n=2, each filled with two particles.

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me look at the options:

Option B: 4E, 10E,50E.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Hm, so the ground state in option B is 4E. Let's think about that. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe each particle can occupy the same n but different spins. So the four particles are in n=1 (two spins) and n=2 (two spins), which gives 2E + 8E = 10E as the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E. But looking at the options, none of them have 10E as the ground state except option B and C.

Wait, the question says "ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the possible states. Maybe the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n, but that's not possible because they are fermions and can't have the same quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique set. So n=1 can have two (spin up and down), n=2 can have two, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total energy of 10E. Then the first excited state would have the highest particle in n=2 moving up to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3.

Wait, no, because when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, you can't have the same n with two, because the other two would be in n=2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the possible states as filled shells.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when the four particles are in the first two shells, each filled. So 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. That gives 2*1E + 2*4E=10E.

The first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. So maybe moving two particles into n=3. But wait, each n can have two, so perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can have two, so the first excited state would have two in n=3, but how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has the four particles arranged with the highest particle in n=3. Let me think: the filling would be n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). But no, that's not possible because each n can hold two, so n=2 can have another one, but then it's two in n=2 and two in n=1. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would require one of the n=2 particles to promote. Let's calculate the energy for that configuration.

So, two in n=1: 2E.

One in n=2: 4E.

One in n=3: 9E.

Total: 2E +4E +9E = 15E. But looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E as the three energies. But wait, the question says it's the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So 10E is the ground state, 15E is first excited, and 18E is second. But I don't see any option with that. Let me check the options again.

Option D says 10E,15E,18E. That seems plausible. But earlier, I thought the ground state was 10E. So the first excited state would be 15E, which matches option D. But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same energy level. But that's impossible because each n can take two particles. So four particles would require at least two n's—n=1 and n=2, each filled with two.

So ground state energy is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But how? Because each n can take two, so you can't have three particles in n=1 and n=2 and n=3. Wait, no, each n can have two, so two in n=1, two in n=3. That would be the first excited state.

Wait, why? Because if you have two in n=1 and two in n=3, the total energy is 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E =20E. Hmm, but that's higher than moving one particle to n=3. Let me see—what's the correct configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the next available level is filled. So after n=2, the next is n=3. But since n=2 can hold two, and the system has four particles, perhaps the next highest energy is when two are in n=3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of the possible arrangements.

The particles must be filled in the lowest available states. So:

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total energy: 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

First excited state: The next possible state would have one of the particles from n=2 moving to n=3. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is at n=3 and the rest in lower states. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, each n can take two, so why can't we have two in n=3?

Wait, because the system has four particles. So if you have two in n=1, and two in n=3, that's allowed. So the energy would be 2*1E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't among the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energies in terms of the sum of the squares of their quantum numbers. Let me list the possible energies for different configurations.

For four particles:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2. So sum is 1² +1² +2² +2² =1 +1 +4 +4=10. So energy is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps 1,1,2,3. So sum is 1+1+4+9=15. So energy is 15E.

Second excited state: maybe 1,2,2,3. Sum is 1+4+4+9=18. Or perhaps 1,1,3,3: sum is 1+1+9+9=20.

Wait, but how do I order these configurations in terms of energy?

The energies are determined by the sum of their squares. So the order of possible sums is as follows:

10, 15, 18, 20, etc.

So the lowest is 10, then 15, then 18, then 20.

So ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we consider four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in the well are quantized as \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each energy level \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two particles fill \( n=1 \) (one spin up and one spin down), and the next two fill \( n=2 \) (one spin up and one spin down). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
\[
n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (1 \text{ particle}), \, n=3 \, (1 \text{ particle}).
\]
The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1E) + 4E + 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=4 \). The configuration becomes:
\[
n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (0 \text{ particles}), \, n=3 \, (1 \text{ particle}), \, n=4 \, (1 \text{ particle}).
\]
The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + E_3 + E_4 = 2(1E) + 9E + 16E = 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E.
\]

### Matching with Options:
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy: \( 10E \),
- First excited state energy: \( 15E \),
- Second excited state energy: \( 18E \).

This matches **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \).

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in the nth level is given by E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Wait, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, because they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. But since they're in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n. However, each particle also has a spin quantum number, which can be either up or down. 

So each state in the well can be occupied by two particles with opposite spins. But wait, in this scenario, since it's a one-dimensional well, each energy level can have a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and another with spin down. So for each n, you can have two particles.

Now, the system is four particles. Let's think about how they fill the energy levels. The ground state would be the lowest energy possible. The first excited state is the next lowest, and the second excited state is the next one up.

In the ground state, we need to fill the lowest possible energy levels with the four particles. Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E
n=2: E_2 = 4 E
n=3: 9 E
n=4: 16 E
n=5:25 E
... and so on.

But since each n can hold two particles, let's see how four particles fill this.

For four particles:
- The first two particles will go into n=1, each with opposite spins. So that's two particles in n=1.
- The next two can't both go into n=2 because that would require four particles, but each n can only take two. Wait, no—each n can take two particles, so for each n, it's two. So second level (n=2) holds two particles. So the first four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So with four particles, two will go into n=1 (spin up and down) and two will go into n=2 (spin up and down). So the ground state is when all four are filled with the lowest possible n's.

Wait, but wait another thing: the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. So for the ground state, two particles are at n=1 and two at n=2.

So energy of ground state is (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Or wait, no, wait—each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two would be 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, so two is 8E. So total is 10E. 

Wait, but wait—the question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So let me clarify the arrangement of the particles.

In the ground state, the four particles will fill the lowest available orbitals with maximum possible spin multiplicity. Since each n can hold two, we have:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but what about the next states, the excited states? Let's think about the first excited state. The first excited state would be the next higher energy configuration. So which orbital would change?

Wait no, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state would have the next possible energy, which is when one of the particles moves to the next higher energy level. But in this case, because spin is involved, perhaps I should think about the orderings.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible states as filled shells and then find the next possible state where the highest particle moves up. Alternatively, perhaps each particle is considered as filling the lowest possible states.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy levels are filled as follows:

Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So the first two particles go into n=1, each with spin up and down. The next two go into n=2 with spin up and down. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the energy is 2*(1E + 4E) = 10E.

Wait, but that's the ground state. Now, for the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles from n=2 moves up to n=3? But wait, no. Because each state is filled with the lowest possible energy. So the first excited state would be when the highest particle moves to the next available state.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but since each n can hold two, perhaps that's not the case. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The first excited state would then involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but how? Because each n can hold two, perhaps the configuration becomes n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). But wait, no, because for identical particles, each n can hold two. So if a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, perhaps the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). But wait, each n can have two, so n=2 can have one or two. Hmm—wait, maybe the first excited state would have the same number of particles in lower levels but with some promotion.

Wait, maybe I should list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The possible states are filled in the order of their energy. The ground state is the lowest possible.

The ground state would have the four particles in the lowest two energy levels: n=1 and n=2, each filled with two particles.

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me look at the options:

Option B: 4E, 10E,50E.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Hm, so the ground state in option B is 4E. Let's think about that. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe each particle can occupy the same n but different spins. So the four particles are in n=1 (two spins) and n=2 (two spins), which gives 2E + 8E = 10E as the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E. But looking at the options, none of them have 10E as the ground state except option B and C.

Wait, the question says "ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the possible states. Maybe the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n, but that's not possible because they are fermions and can't have the same quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique set. So n=1 can have two (spin up and down), n=2 can have two, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total energy of 10E. Then the first excited state would have the highest particle in n=2 moving up to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3.

Wait, no, because when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, you can't have the same n with two, because the other two would be in n=2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the possible states as filled shells.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when the four particles are in the first two shells, each filled. So 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. That gives 2*1E + 2*4E=10E.

The first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. So maybe moving two particles into n=3. But wait, each n can have two, so perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can have two, so the first excited state would have two in n=3, but how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has the four particles arranged with the highest particle in n=3. Let me think: the filling would be n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). But no, that's not possible because each n can hold two, so n=2 can have another one, but then it's two in n=2 and two in n=1. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would require one of the n=2 particles to promote. Let's calculate the energy for that configuration.

So, two in n=1: 2E.

One in n=2: 4E.

One in n=3: 9E.

Total: 2E +4E +9E = 15E. But looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E as the three energies. But wait, the question says it's the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So 10E is the ground state, 15E is first excited, and 18E is second. But I don't see any option with that. Let me check the options again.

Option D says 10E,15E,18E. That seems plausible. But earlier, I thought the ground state was 10E. So the first excited state would be 15E, which matches option D. But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same energy level. But that's impossible because each n can take two particles. So four particles would require at least two n's—n=1 and n=2, each filled with two.

So ground state energy is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But how? Because each n can take two, so you can't have three particles in n=1 and n=2 and n=3. Wait, no, each n can have two, so two in n=1, two in n=3. That would be the first excited state.

Wait, why? Because if you have two in n=1 and two in n=3, the total energy is 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E =20E. Hmm, but that's higher than moving one particle to n=3. Let me see—what's the correct configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the next available level is filled. So after n=2, the next is n=3. But since n=2 can hold two, and the system has four particles, perhaps the next highest energy is when two are in n=3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of the possible arrangements.

The particles must be filled in the lowest available states. So:

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total energy: 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

First excited state: The next possible state would have one of the particles from n=2 moving to n=3. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is at n=3 and the rest in lower states. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, each n can take two, so why can't we have two in n=3?

Wait, because the system has four particles. So if you have two in n=1, and two in n=3, that's allowed. So the energy would be 2*1E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't among the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energies in terms of the sum of the squares of their quantum numbers. Let me list the possible energies for different configurations.

For four particles:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2. So sum is 1² +1² +2² +2² =1 +1 +4 +4=10. So energy is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps 1,1,2,3. So sum is 1+1+4+9=15. So energy is 15E.

Second excited state: maybe 1,2,2,3. Sum is 1+4+4+9=18. Or perhaps 1,1,3,3: sum is 1+1+9+9=20.

Wait, but how do I order these configurations in terms of energy?

The energies are determined by the sum of their squares. So the order of possible sums is as follows:

10, 15, 18, 20, etc.

So the lowest is 10, then 15, then 18, then 20.

So ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we consider four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in the well are quantized as \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each energy level \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two particles fill \( n=1 \) (one spin up and one spin down), and the next two fill \( n=2 \) (one spin up and one spin down). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
\[
n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (1 \text{ particle}), \, n=3 \, (1 \text{ particle}).
\]
The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1E) + 4E + 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=4 \). The configuration becomes:
\[
n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (0 \text{ particles}), \, n=3 \, (1 \text{ particle}), \, n=4 \, (1 \text{ particle}).
\]
The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + E_3 + E_4 = 2(1E) + 9E + 16E = 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E.
\]

### Matching with Options:
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy: \( 10E \),
- First excited state energy: \( 15E \),
- Second excited state energy: \( 18E \).

This matches **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \).
