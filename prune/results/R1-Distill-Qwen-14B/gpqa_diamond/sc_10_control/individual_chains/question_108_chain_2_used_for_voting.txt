Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, which probably means it's in a state with low m, maybe m=0 or ±1. But wait, I'm not exactly sure how m being small plays into this. Maybe it affects the energy levels somehow?

The main thing I need to compare is the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ and the transition energy ΔE. I remember that in atoms, when you apply a magnetic field, the energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect. The paramagnetic term is related to the magnetic interaction energy.

Hydrogen's transition energy here has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I think that's in the visible range, like the Balmer series. So the energy ΔE would be the energy difference between two levels, probably something like the Lyman or Balmer transitions. Let me calculate ΔE from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters. 

Calculating E: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ approximately 4.09e-19 J. Wait, but that's the energy of a photon. Since this is a transition energy ΔE, that should be the same as the photon's energy.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩. I think that's the expectation value of the magnetic Hamiltonian. The paramagnetic term is usually given by -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (about 2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but in this case, since the field is applied, the energy due to the magnetic interaction is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B g m_s B, maybe? Or wait, for orbital magnetic moment, it's μ = mμ_B, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

Wait no, wait. The paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin, I think. Or is it the orbital? Oh, I'm a bit confused. Because orbital magnetism is different from spin. But in the presence of a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field.

But for hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so the orbital magnetic moment is zero. So maybe the paramagnetic term is due to the spin magnetic moment. Oh wait, but that's for paramagnetism. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling is the spin-orbit term, but wait, no, spin-orbit is a different effect. Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism arises from the spin magnetic moments. So the paramagnetic term should involve the spin. So the Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic term would be H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment.

The spin magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For electrons, γ is (e/(2m_e)) * g, with g being the Landé g-factor for spin, which is approximately 2. So the spin magnetic moment is μ = -g μ_B S_z / ħ ?

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula. The magnetic energy is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for spin is μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. So m_s can be ±1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B g m_s B. Let's plug in the numbers. μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.274e-24 J/T. The g-factor for spin is approximately 2. So if m_s is ±1/2, then the expectation value would be ± (9.274e-24 J/T) * 2 * (1/2) * B.

Wait, let me compute that. So 9.274e-24 * 2 * (1/2) = 9.274e-24 J/T. Then multiply by B=1 T, so 9.274e-24 J. So ⟨H⟩ is about ±9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that m is small. Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m = 0, ±1, etc., depending on l. Since the orbital l is small, m would be small. But in that case, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is m μ_B. But for spin, m_s is ±1/2. So if the paramagnetic term is due to orbital magnetism, then ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m. But if m is small, like m=0 or 1, then the energy would be much smaller compared to the transition energy ΔE we calculated earlier, which was about 4e-19 J.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term could be either orbital or spin. The problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the spin term. Because paramagnetism is due to unpaired spins. But for hydrogen, the ground state is 1s, which has l=0, so the electron is in s orbital with spin 1/2. So the magnetic moment comes only from spin. So the paramagnetic term is due to spin.

So, for hydrogen, each state has a spin magnetic moment, so the paramagnetic coupling would be proportional to spin. So for a spin up, m_s=+1/2, so the energy would be H = -μ·B = - (g μ_B m_s) B. So, that's - (2 * 9.27e-24 J/T * 0.5) * 1 T = -9.27e-24 J. So magnitude is about 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-19 J. Let me compare the two. 9.27e-24 J is way smaller than 4e-19 J. Because 4e-19 is 4,000 times 1e-22, and 9e-24 is 0.9e-23, which is 0.09e-22. So 4e-19 is 40,000 times larger than 9e-24. So 9e-24 is much much smaller than 4e-19.

So ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-23 J, and ΔE is about 4e-19 J. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm considering the right terms. Another approach: the paramagnetic term comes from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field. The transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states. For hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized, and the transitions correspond to specific wavelengths.

Wait, another way to think about it: the energy levels of hydrogen are on the order of eV. For example, the ground state energy is about -13.6 eV, which is about 2.18e-18 J. The transition energy ΔE is the difference between two such levels. So for a wavelength of 0.486 micrometers, which is in the visible range (Balmer series), the energy is about 3.0 eV or so? Let me calculate it again.

Wait, using E=hc/λ. Let me compute it in eV. h is 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c is 3e8 m/s, λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (4.1357e-15 eV·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) = (1.2407e-6 eV·m) * (3e8 m) / (0.4861e-6 m) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute hc in eV·nm. Since 1 eV·nm = 1e-9 eV·m. hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So λ is 486.1 nm. So E = 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV. Oh, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV, which is 2.55 * 1.6e-19 J ≈ 4.08e-19 J, which matches our earlier calculation.

The paramagnetic term is about 9.27e-24 J, which is about 0.57 meV (since 1 eV is 1e6 meV, so 9.27e-24 J is 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 = ~5.8e-5 eV, which is 0.058 meV). So the paramagnetic term is about 0.058 meV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the ratio is 0.058 meV / 2.55 eV = 0.058e-3 eV / 2.55e0 eV = 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ ~2.27e-5. That's about 0.002%, which is way smaller.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we find:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The spin magnetic moment is given by:  
   \[
   \mu = g \mu_B m_s,
   \]  
   where \( g \) is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for electrons), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m_s = \pm 1/2 \) is the spin magnetic quantum number. The energy is:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m_s B.
   \]  
   Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( m_s = 1/2 \), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -(2)(9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1/2)(1) \approx -9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The magnitude of \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \), or about \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) (0.058 meV).

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is about \( 0.058 \, \text{meV} \). The ratio of \( \langle H \rangle \) to \( \Delta E \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{0.058 \, \text{meV}}{2.55 \, \text{eV}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This means \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately 0.002% of \( \Delta E \), or about \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Calculating E: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ approximately 4.09e-19 J. Wait, but that's the energy of a photon. Since this is a transition energy ΔE, that should be the same as the photon's energy.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩. I think that's the expectation value of the magnetic Hamiltonian. The paramagnetic term is usually given by -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (about 2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but in this case, since the field is applied, the energy due to the magnetic interaction is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B g m_s B, maybe? Or wait, for orbital magnetic moment, it's μ = mμ_B, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

Wait no, wait. The paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin, I think. Or is it the orbital? Oh, I'm a bit confused. Because orbital magnetism is different from spin. But in the presence of a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field.

But for hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so the orbital magnetic moment is zero. So maybe the paramagnetic term is due to the spin magnetic moment. Oh wait, but that's for paramagnetism. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling is the spin-orbit term, but wait, no, spin-orbit is a different effect. Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism arises from the spin magnetic moments. So the paramagnetic term should involve the spin. So the Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic term would be H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment.

The spin magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For electrons, γ is (e/(2m_e)) * g, with g being the Landé g-factor for spin, which is approximately 2. So the spin magnetic moment is μ = -g μ_B S_z / ħ ?

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula. The magnetic energy is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for spin is μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. So m_s can be ±1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B g m_s B. Let's plug in the numbers. μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.274e-24 J/T. The g-factor for spin is approximately 2. So if m_s is ±1/2, then the expectation value would be ± (9.274e-24 J/T) * 2 * (1/2) * B.

Wait, let me compute that. So 9.274e-24 * 2 * (1/2) = 9.274e-24 J/T. Then multiply by B=1 T, so 9.274e-24 J. So ⟨H⟩ is about ±9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that m is small. Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m = 0, ±1, etc., depending on l. Since the orbital l is small, m would be small. But in that case, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is m μ_B. But for spin, m_s is ±1/2. So if the paramagnetic term is due to orbital magnetism, then ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m. But if m is small, like m=0 or 1, then the energy would be much smaller compared to the transition energy ΔE we calculated earlier, which was about 4e-19 J.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term could be either orbital or spin. The problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the spin term. Because paramagnetism is due to unpaired spins. But for hydrogen, the ground state is 1s, which has l=0, so the electron is in s orbital with spin 1/2. So the magnetic moment comes only from spin. So the paramagnetic term is due to spin.

So, for hydrogen, each state has a spin magnetic moment, so the paramagnetic coupling would be proportional to spin. So for a spin up, m_s=+1/2, so the energy would be H = -μ·B = - (g μ_B m_s) B. So, that's - (2 * 9.27e-24 J/T * 0.5) * 1 T = -9.27e-24 J. So magnitude is about 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-19 J. Let me compare the two. 9.27e-24 J is way smaller than 4e-19 J. Because 4e-19 is 4,000 times 1e-22, and 9e-24 is 0.9e-23, which is 0.09e-22. So 4e-19 is 40,000 times larger than 9e-24. So 9e-24 is much much smaller than 4e-19.

So ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-23 J, and ΔE is about 4e-19 J. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm considering the right terms. Another approach: the paramagnetic term comes from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field. The transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states. For hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized, and the transitions correspond to specific wavelengths.

Wait, another way to think about it: the energy levels of hydrogen are on the order of eV. For example, the ground state energy is about -13.6 eV, which is about 2.18e-18 J. The transition energy ΔE is the difference between two such levels. So for a wavelength of 0.486 micrometers, which is in the visible range (Balmer series), the energy is about 3.0 eV or so? Let me calculate it again.

Wait, using E=hc/λ. Let me compute it in eV. h is 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c is 3e8 m/s, λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (4.1357e-15 eV·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) = (1.2407e-6 eV·m) * (3e8 m) / (0.4861e-6 m) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute hc in eV·nm. Since 1 eV·nm = 1e-9 eV·m. hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So λ is 486.1 nm. So E = 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV. Oh, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV, which is 2.55 * 1.6e-19 J ≈ 4.08e-19 J, which matches our earlier calculation.

The paramagnetic term is about 9.27e-24 J, which is about 0.57 meV (since 1 eV is 1e6 meV, so 9.27e-24 J is 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 = ~5.8e-5 eV, which is 0.058 meV). So the paramagnetic term is about 0.058 meV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the ratio is 0.058 meV / 2.55 eV = 0.058e-3 eV / 2.55e0 eV = 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ ~2.27e-5. That's about 0.002%, which is way smaller.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we find:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The spin magnetic moment is given by:  
   \[
   \mu = g \mu_B m_s,
   \]  
   where \( g \) is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for electrons), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m_s = \pm 1/2 \) is the spin magnetic quantum number. The energy is:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m_s B.
   \]  
   Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( m_s = 1/2 \), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -(2)(9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1/2)(1) \approx -9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The magnitude of \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \), or about \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) (0.058 meV).

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is about \( 0.058 \, \text{meV} \). The ratio of \( \langle H \rangle \) to \( \Delta E \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{0.058 \, \text{meV}}{2.55 \, \text{eV}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This means \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately 0.002% of \( \Delta E \), or about \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.

Answer: C
