Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is stationary, so that should simplify things a bit.

Wait, the rest masses are given: Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. But wait, what about the neutrino? Oh, right, neutrinos are super light. I think for most purposes, especially in problems like this, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible. So maybe I can treat it as massless, which would make calculations easier.

So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That makes sense because the total momentum after decay should still be zero.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each particle has its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus a tiny bit (which we can ignore). So the muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its KE, and the neutrino's energy is just its KE.

Let me set up the equations. Let me denote the KE of the muon as K_mu and the KE of the neutrino as K_nu. The pion's rest mass is M_pi = 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is M_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So, the total energy after decay is M_mu*c² + K_mu + K_nu. But the pion's energy before decay is M_pi*c². So,

M_pi*c² = M_mu*c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just K_nu. So that's correct.

Also, since momentum is conserved, the momenta of mu and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So, the magnitudes are the same.

Momentum of muon (p_mu) is gamma*M_mu*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Similarly, the neutrino's momentum p_nu is gamma_nu * m_nu * v_nu. But since m_nu is negligible, p_nu is approximately K_nu / c^2 * c (since for massless particles, E=pc). Wait, no, E=pc, so p= E/c, which is K_nu (since E for neutrino is K_nu + m_nu c^2, but m_nu is zero). So p_nu = K_nu / c.

Wait, but for a muon, the momentum p_mu = gamma * M_mu * v. Alternatively, since E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 ), that's another way to write it.

So, since p_mu = p_nu, because their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, we can write:

p_mu = p_nu = K_nu / c. Because for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c, so p_nu = E_nu / c = K_nu / c.

Wait, but for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 ). So, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). But E_mu is also M_mu c^2 + K_mu. So:

M_mu c^2 + K_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 )

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated. Let me square both sides:

(M_mu c^2 + K_mu)^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2

Expanding the left side:

M_mu² c^4 + 2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu² = p_mu² c^2 + M_mu² c^4

Subtract M_mu² c^4 from both sides:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu² c^2

We can write p_mu in terms of K_nu, since p_mu = p_nu = K_nu / c. So p_mu c = K_nu.

So substituting p_mu c = K_nu into the equation:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = (K_nu)^2

And from the energy conservation equation:

M_pi c^2 = M_mu c^2 + K_mu + K_nu

Let me rearrange that:

K_nu = M_pi c^2 - M_mu c^2 - K_mu

But M_pi is 139.6, M_mu is 105.7, so M_pi - M_mu = 33.9 MeV.

So,

K_nu = 33.9 MeV - K_mu

Hmm. So plug this into the earlier equation.

We have:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = (K_nu)^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Let me compute M_mu in MeV/c², but since all variables are in MeV, I can treat c as 1 in these units. So M_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So, equation becomes:

2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:

(33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2

Which is 1149.21 - 67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2.

So, the equation is:

211.4 K_mu + K_mu^2 = 1149.21 -67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2

Subtract K_mu^2 from both sides:

211.4 K_mu = 1149.21 -67.8 K_mu

Bring all terms to one side:

211.4 K_mu +67.8 K_mu -1149.21 =0

279.2 K_mu = 1149.21

So K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1149.21 by 279.2.

279.2 *4 = 1116.8. 1149.21-1116.8 = 32.41. 32.41 /279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So approximately 4.116. So K_mu ≈4.12 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the calculation.

279.2 into 1149.21:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 -1116.8 = 32.41.

32.41 / 279.2 = approximately 0.116.

So 4.116, so about 4.12 MeV. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then, K_nu is 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 MeV, approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait a minute, looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recast the equation.

Another approach: Let me denote x = K_mu.

From the equation:

2 *105.7 *x + x² = (33.9 -x)^2

Expanding the right side: 33.9² - 2*33.9 x +x² = 1149.21 -67.8 x +x².

Left side: 211.4 x + x².

Set equal:

211.4 x + x² = 1149.21 -67.8 x +x²

Subtract x²:

211.4 x = 1149.21 -67.8 x

Adding 67.8 x to both sides: 279.2 x = 1149.21.

So x = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈4.116 MeV, which is about 4.12 MeV.

So the KE of muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 33.9 -4.12 = 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(M_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(M_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
- The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:
   \[
   M_{\pi} c^2 = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\) are the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation:
For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (M_{\mu} c^2)^2}
\]
Since \(E_{\mu} = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}\), substituting gives:
\[
M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (M_{\mu} c^2)^2}
\]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\):
From momentum conservation, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\). For the neutrino, \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c\), so:
\[
p_{\mu} c = K_{\nu}
\]

Substituting \(p_{\mu} c = K_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
M_{\pi} c^2 = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}
\]
we find:
\[
K_{\nu} = M_{\pi} c^2 - M_{\mu} c^2 - K_{\mu}
\]

Using the energy-momentum relation for the muon and substituting \(K_{\nu}\), we solve for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\). After simplifications, we find:
\[
K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

So, the total energy after decay is M_mu*c² + K_mu + K_nu. But the pion's energy before decay is M_pi*c². So,

M_pi*c² = M_mu*c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just K_nu. So that's correct.

Also, since momentum is conserved, the momenta of mu and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So, the magnitudes are the same.

Momentum of muon (p_mu) is gamma*M_mu*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Similarly, the neutrino's momentum p_nu is gamma_nu * m_nu * v_nu. But since m_nu is negligible, p_nu is approximately K_nu / c^2 * c (since for massless particles, E=pc). Wait, no, E=pc, so p= E/c, which is K_nu (since E for neutrino is K_nu + m_nu c^2, but m_nu is zero). So p_nu = K_nu / c.

Wait, but for a muon, the momentum p_mu = gamma * M_mu * v. Alternatively, since E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 ), that's another way to write it.

So, since p_mu = p_nu, because their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, we can write:

p_mu = p_nu = K_nu / c. Because for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c, so p_nu = E_nu / c = K_nu / c.

Wait, but for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 ). So, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). But E_mu is also M_mu c^2 + K_mu. So:

M_mu c^2 + K_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2 )

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated. Let me square both sides:

(M_mu c^2 + K_mu)^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (M_mu c^2)^2

Expanding the left side:

M_mu² c^4 + 2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu² = p_mu² c^2 + M_mu² c^4

Subtract M_mu² c^4 from both sides:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu² c^2

We can write p_mu in terms of K_nu, since p_mu = p_nu = K_nu / c. So p_mu c = K_nu.

So substituting p_mu c = K_nu into the equation:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = (K_nu)^2

And from the energy conservation equation:

M_pi c^2 = M_mu c^2 + K_mu + K_nu

Let me rearrange that:

K_nu = M_pi c^2 - M_mu c^2 - K_mu

But M_pi is 139.6, M_mu is 105.7, so M_pi - M_mu = 33.9 MeV.

So,

K_nu = 33.9 MeV - K_mu

Hmm. So plug this into the earlier equation.

We have:

2 M_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 = (K_nu)^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Let me compute M_mu in MeV/c², but since all variables are in MeV, I can treat c as 1 in these units. So M_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So, equation becomes:

2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:

(33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2

Which is 1149.21 - 67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2.

So, the equation is:

211.4 K_mu + K_mu^2 = 1149.21 -67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2

Subtract K_mu^2 from both sides:

211.4 K_mu = 1149.21 -67.8 K_mu

Bring all terms to one side:

211.4 K_mu +67.8 K_mu -1149.21 =0

279.2 K_mu = 1149.21

So K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1149.21 by 279.2.

279.2 *4 = 1116.8. 1149.21-1116.8 = 32.41. 32.41 /279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So approximately 4.116. So K_mu ≈4.12 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the calculation.

279.2 into 1149.21:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 -1116.8 = 32.41.

32.41 / 279.2 = approximately 0.116.

So 4.116, so about 4.12 MeV. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then, K_nu is 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 MeV, approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait a minute, looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recast the equation.

Another approach: Let me denote x = K_mu.

From the equation:

2 *105.7 *x + x² = (33.9 -x)^2

Expanding the right side: 33.9² - 2*33.9 x +x² = 1149.21 -67.8 x +x².

Left side: 211.4 x + x².

Set equal:

211.4 x + x² = 1149.21 -67.8 x +x²

Subtract x²:

211.4 x = 1149.21 -67.8 x

Adding 67.8 x to both sides: 279.2 x = 1149.21.

So x = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈4.116 MeV, which is about 4.12 MeV.

So the KE of muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 33.9 -4.12 = 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(M_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
- The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:
   \[
   M_{\pi} c^2 = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\) are the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation:
For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (M_{\mu} c^2)^2}
\]
Since \(E_{\mu} = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}\), substituting gives:
\[
M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (M_{\mu} c^2)^2}
\]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\):
From momentum conservation, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\). For the neutrino, \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c\), so:
\[
p_{\mu} c = K_{\nu}
\]

Substituting \(p_{\mu} c = K_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
M_{\pi} c^2 = M_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}
\]
we find:
\[
K_{\nu} = M_{\pi} c^2 - M_{\mu} c^2 - K_{\mu}
\]

Using the energy-momentum relation for the muon and substituting \(K_{\nu}\), we solve for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\). After simplifications, we find:
\[
K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
