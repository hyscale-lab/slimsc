Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data.

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak around 2500-3300, but sometimes the O-H in a carbonyl compound can be broad too. But if it's a very broad peak at 3000, could it be an alcohol?

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical carbonyl. Maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Or maybe an amide? But wait, the 1650 could also be conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if there are two different carbonyl groups, like maybe a ketone and an ester, but that might complicate things. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to a double bond. Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Hmm, not entirely sure yet, but let's note that there's a strong peak at 1700 and another at 1650.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, like maybe an alkene. So the molecule has a C=C somewhere.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. So I need to think about what fragments would produce a peak at 45. Common fragments at 45 could be CH3CO+ (which is 43, but maybe with something else?), or perhaps (CH3)2O is 45 (because 2*(15 for CH3) is 30, plus 16 for O is 46? Wait, no. Wait, molecular weight of (CH3)2O is 30 (2*CH3= 2*15 =30?) Wait, no. Let me calculate: CH3 is 15, so (CH3)2O is 15*2 + 16 = 46. Hmm, so 46. But wait, the fragment is m/z 45. So maybe something else. What else is 45? Maybe a CH2O group? Let's see: CH2O is 30 (12 + 2 + 16 =30). No, that's not 45. Wait, another option: an acetate group? The acetate ion is C2H3O2^- which has a molecular weight of 60 (12*2+3+16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59. Hmm, but that's 59, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Wait, maybe it's the acetyl group, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment of a ketone. For example, if the molecule breaks into a CH3CO group, that's 43 (12+16+1+12+16= no, wait: CH3CO is (12*2 + 1*4 + 16) = 24+4+16=44. Hmm, 44. Not 45. Or perhaps a CH2O group plus something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propyl group? Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of a CH3COCH3? No, that's (12*3 + 1*6 +16*2) =36+6+32=74. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps 45 comes from (CH3)CO? Let me compute that. CH3CO would be 12 + 16 + (12 + 3) = 12 +16=28, plus 15 (CH3) is 43. No, same as before. Hmmm.

Wait, another approach: a common fragment is the acetyl (CH3CO) group with a + charge, which would be m/z 43. But the question says 45. So perhaps it's a different fragment. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group. Wait, perhaps it's a fragment where a CH2 group is attached to something. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone group loses something.

Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, but wait, that's 46 as I thought earlier. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the molecular weight of something else. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to something else? Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ester group. For example, ethyl acetate's structure is CH3COOCH2CH3. If part of it breaks off, maybe the acetate group (which is C2H3O2^-). But that's 60, as I thought before.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's look at the options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So each has varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. So perhaps I can figure out the functional groups based on the IR and NMR, and then see which formula fits.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was O-H, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Then the peaks at 1700 and 1650: 1700 is probably a carbonyl. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, or perhaps an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene with substituents).

Wait, but benzene's C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe an aromatic ring with substituents causing some stretching, or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone next to a double bond.

So if the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which confirms a double bond. So the molecule has a C=C.

Putting it together, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, or maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So would that account for one of the degrees of unsaturation. Then another could be a ring or a carbonyl. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so that would be the other. So for option A, 1 degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. Wait, but the molecule has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group. So that's two degrees. But option A has only one degree. So that can't be right. Therefore, option A can't be the answer because it can't account for two degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

Option A: C6H12O2.

So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1.

But in the molecule, we have at least one double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group. That's two DoU, so this formula can't be correct. So option A is out.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees of unsaturation. That's possible. For example, a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a double bond and a carbonyl group. But in the IR, we have a carbonyl, so that's one DoU, and the vinyl H implies another, so that would account for two. That's possible. So option B is a possibility.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Again, two degrees. So same as option B, but with an additional O. So maybe a compound with a carbonyl and a double bond, plus perhaps another oxygen-containing group.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1.

Again, only one DoU. But the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl, which is two DoU, so this can't be. So D is out.

So the possible options are B and C.

Now, back to the IR and NMR.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an O-H group. So we're looking for a compound with an O-H, which would be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

The 1700 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group. So if we have O-H and a carbonyl, that's two functional groups. So perhaps the compound has both.

So possible structures could be a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would be a secondary alcohol, which might have a broad peak but perhaps less so than a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester (but esters don't have O-H). Wait, wait, no—esters are O-H? No, esters have an O-C-O structure but don't have an acidic O-H. So if we have O-H and a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the FTIR would have a very broad peak, perhaps around 2500-3300, but the question says 3000. Alternatively, an alcohol with a carbonyl.

Wait, another route: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The 1700 is a carbonyl, so that's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide (but I don't think that's the case here). But wait, the 1650 is also a peak. So perhaps the 1700 is the carbonyl and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

So for the structure, maybe a compound with both an O-H and a carbonyl group. For example, a phenolic compound with a carbonyl, or an alcohol with a ketone. But that would require the compound to have both groups.

Wait, but the formula options are C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc. Let's think about what functional groups are possible.

If the compound is an ester, it would have an O-CO-O group, but no O-H. So that wouldn't explain the broad peak at 3000. So perhaps it's a compound with an alcohol group and a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanone with an alcohol group, but that might not have a double bond.

Wait, wait. The problem says the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond, either as part of an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1650, which is lower than typical for a C=C in an alkene. So maybe it's an aromatic ring. The C=C in benzene is around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is at the higher end. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene, where the substituents cause the C=C to be at a higher wavenumber. Or perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, where the conjugation lowers the wavenumber a bit.

So, if the compound has a benzene ring, then that would account for the 1650 cm^-1 peak as the C=C stretching. But a benzene ring has three double bonds (each C-C is a double bond), so that would account for three degrees of unsaturation. But earlier, with options B and C, the DoU is only two. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So in that case, the ring (one DoU) and the double bond (another DoU), but that would be two DoU. But a cyclohexene would have a double bond and a ring, giving two DoU, which matches options B and C.

So, if the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H group, that would fit the data.

But wait, that would require the molecule to have three functional groups? Or perhaps a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent.

But then, the formula would need to account for that.

Let me think about the possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 2. So, either two rings, two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, plus the O's.

But if the structure has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group (C=O), that's two DoU, which would fit. So the molecule could be a cyclohexene with a ketone group and an alcohol group.

Wait, but that would require three substituents on the ring, which might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ketone, but that might not have the conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach: What if the compound is a diethyl acetal or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. But then, the O-H is still needed.

Wait, another thought: The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. Then, the 1700 cm^-1 peak would correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 peak would then be something else. But if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), that would have a carbonyl and an ester group, but no O-H. So that doesn't fit the O-H peak.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto acid. So, a structure like CH2(CO2H)COCH2CH2CH3 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think of possible structures that have a fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

If the formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32= 114. So the molecular ion would be around 114. Then, possible fragments: perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller piece.

If the fragment is 45, what could that be within the formula? Let's see: 45 is 45 grams per mole. So, what's the molecular formula that sums up to 45.

Possible options: C3H6O2? Let's compute: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 74 → too high. Hmm.

Wait, another way: 45 is 45. Let me think of functional groups that would have a mass of 45. Maybe a propyl group? No, that's 3 carbons, which would be 39 (12*3=36 + 3*1=3 → 39). Not 45. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to something. Maybe CH2O is 30, but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: The fragment at 45 is likely a common ion. For example, the acetylium ion (CH3CO+) has a molecular weight of 43. So 43 would be close, but the peak is at 45. So perhaps it's a fragment that includes two oxygen atoms? But O is 16, so 45 -16=29. Hmm, 29 could be C2H5 (29). So maybe CH3COOCH2-? Wait, that's more than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to an oxygen? Like CH2CH2O? Wait, (CH2CH2O) would be 12*2 +1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COCH3 (acetone) which is 58. No, that's too big.

Wait, maybe it's a hydroxyl group attached to something. For example, CH2CH2OH would be 12*2 +1*4 +17= 24+4+17=45. Oh! Wait, that's 45. So the fragment could be CH2CH2OH, which is ethylene glycol monoethyl ether or something. Wait, no, ethylene glycol is HOCH2CH2OH. But if the fragment is just HOCH2CH2, that would be 45.

Wait, but how would that fragment form? Maybe in the case of a compound with a neighboring CH2OH group breaking off.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen and a hydroxyl group. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO-O- group, but that would be 43 plus O (16) so 59, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again about the molecular formula. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible structures include esters, ketones, and alcohols. One possibility is something like methyl cyclohexene ketone, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible functional groups. An ester would have a carbonyl and an OR group. But then, where would the O-H come from? Maybe not an ester.

Wait, another thought: The broad O-H could be from a phenol group. So a phenol with a carbonyl group. But then, that would require a benzene ring, which would account for three DoU (the ring has three double bonds), but earlier the options only provide two DoU. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the O-H is from an alcohol, and the carbonyl is from a ketone. So the compound is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent.

So, for example, cyclohexene with a hydroxymethyl group and a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would look.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanone with a double bond and an OH group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentanone with a substituent. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetone derivative with an alcohol group and a double bond. For example, 3-penten-2-one with an alcohol substituent. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic compound, but that would require more DoU than allowed.

Wait, going back to the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there's a double bond, perhaps in an allylic position or as part of a ring.

Another thought: The FTIR has a 1700 cm^-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester. So if it's an ester, then the molecular formula would have two O's, like in option C (C6H10O2).

But wait, an ester's structure is R-O-CO-R. So that would have two O's in the ester group. Then, if the compound is an ester and has an O-H group, that would fit the IR data. So, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group. But that would imply a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another possibility: The compound is a beta-keto ester. So, for example, ethyl acetoacetate. Let me think about its structure. It has the structure CH3COCH2COOEt. Wait, that's four carbons in the main chain, but the options have six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester or a substituted ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl succinate or something, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Then the IR would have the carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated C=C at around 1650. That fits the IR data. So, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the carbonyl and the conjugated double bond. The O-H would come from where? If it's an ester, there's no O-H. Unless it's a hemiacetal or an acid, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group elsewhere. So, for example, a compound with an ester and an alcohol group.

But then the molecular formula would have to include both. Let's see, option C is C6H10O2. So, for an ester (which has two O's), plus an alcohol group (which adds another O). But that would require three O's, which would make the formula C6H10O3, which isn't an option. So that can't be. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of the ester group. But esters are OR-CO-O-R', so no, they don't have O-H.

Hmm. Maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal. Hemiacetals have an O-H group. But then, the carbonyl would be in the cyclic structure. So the IR would show the O-H and the carbonyl. That could fit.

For example, a cyclic hemiacetal like in glucose derivatives, but that's a six-membered ring. Wait, but the molecular formula may not fit. Let's think: cyclic hemiacetal would have a ring (so one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), but then another double bond? Or perhaps the hemiacetal has a double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ether linkage and an O-H group. But that seems complicated.

Another angle: Looking at the options again. The only options with O2 are A and C. So, the mass spec fragment is 45, which could be a CH2CH2OH group (45). If the compound has such a fragment, perhaps it's an ester where the R group is CH2CH2OH.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H10O2, then the ester would be something like R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R is CH2CH2OH and R' is another group.

Wait, let's compute the molecular formula. If R is CH2CH2OH (which is C2H5O), then R-O-CO-R' would need to sum up to C6H10O2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think of possible structures for each option and see which fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

Possible structures: esters, ketones with hydroxyl, etc.

If it's an ester, then it would be R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R is methyl (CH3O-) and R' is a pentyl group. But that would be CH3O-CO-R', but the molecular formula might not add up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopropane, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2. So two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond. So one DoU from that. The other must be a ring or another double bond.

But the IR has a carbonyl, which is another DoU. So that would make three DoU, but the formula only allows two. So that can't be.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the formula has two DoU, but the structure needs two (double bond and carbonyl), that's fine. Because each double bond or ring is one DoU. So a double bond (one) and a carbonyl (another) would make two DoU, which fits the formula.

So for option C, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the ester group (COO) contributes two oxygens, and the double bond contributes one DoU. That uses up both DoU.

But then where does the O-H come from? Because the FTIR shows an O-H. So the structure must have an O-H group as well.

Hmm, so an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the formula RCOOR', but that doesn't have an O-H. So perhaps the compound isn't an ester then.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester, which has both a ketone and an ester group. Let's see: structure would be RC(O)COOR'. That would have two carbonyl groups, but the IR only shows two peaks in the carbonyl region—1700 and 1650. So perhaps that's the case.

In that scenario, the two carbonyl peaks would correspond to the ketone (around 1700) and the ester (around 1650? But usually esters are around 1700-1750). Hmm, but 1650 is lower than typical ester carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe the ester is conjugated, which would lower the wavenumber.

But regardless, the presence of an O-H group is a problem because beta-keto esters don't have O-H groups. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxy ketone or something, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester with a hydroxyl group? Not sure.

Another thought: The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be from an alcohol O-H. So the compound has an alcohol group. The 1700 cm^-1 is from a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone. The 1650 cm^-1 is from a conjugated double bond.

So the structure could be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent. That would use up two DoU (the ring and the double bond, but wait, the ring is a DoU, the double bond is another, but the ketone is another DoU, making three. But the formula allows for only two. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the ring is not a cyclohexene but a cyclopentene, which has a double bond and a ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexane with a double bond and a ketone group. But that again would require three DoU.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to approach it differently.

Looking at the options, only options B and C have two DoU. Option B is C6H10O. So two DoU, which could be a double bond and a ring. Or another combination.

The IR suggests a carbonyl (so another DoU), but in that case, how to fit?

Wait, perhaps in option B, the compound is a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. The cyclohexene has a ring (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), but that would require three DoU, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the DoU.

Wait, let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU. So the molecule must have one ring or one double bond. But the data suggests two DoU (double bond and carbonyl), which can't fit. So A is out.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU= (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoU. So possible structures: two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, or a ring and a carbonyl.

But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's one DoU, and the vinyl H suggests another, so that's two. So that fits. So the structure would have a carbonyl and a double bond.

But if the structure has a carbonyl and a double bond, then the O-H must come from somewhere else. So perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alkene and an alcohol group. But that would require three DoU, which option B can't have.

Wait, so perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group and a ring, but that would require the double bond to be part of the ring, making it a cyclic ketone.

For example, cyclohexanone. That's a six-membered ring (one DoU) with a ketone (another DoU). So that's two DoU, fitting option B (C6H10O).

But then, where is the O-H coming from? Because the IR shows a broad O-H peak. So perhaps the compound is a cyclohexanol derivative with a ketone. But that would require a secondary alcohol. So maybe a cyclohexanol with a ketone substituent.

But in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2, not C6H10O.

Hmm, so that's a problem. Because option B is C6H10O, which only has one O. So if the structure has both a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two O's, making the formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

So perhaps that's the case. Let me think: the structure is cyclohexanol with a ketone group. So it's a secondary alcohol and a ketone on the same ring. But the formula for that would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So that makes sense.

Now, the IR: the broad peak at 3000 is the O-H of the alcohol. The 1700 is the carbonyl (ketone). The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps another double bond elsewhere, but in this case, the structure is a cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ring with a ketone. So unless there's another double bond, the 1650 peak is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have the conjugated double bond. So the IR would show the carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group in the alpha,beta position.

Wait, but that would require the structure to be something like 1,2-cyclohexanedione? No, that's two ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-cyclohexen-1-one. So a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone. That would have a conjugated system, giving the C=C peak at around 1650.

In that structure, the formula would be C6H8O. Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the molecular formula.

Cyclohexene has the formula C6H10. Adding a ketone (which replaces a CH2 with a CO) would change the formula. If you have a cyclohexene ring with a ketone, that would be C6H8O. Because the cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding a ketone (which replaces a CH2 with a CO, thus subtracting two H's and adding an O.

Wait, so C6H10 → C6H8O (since CH2 becomes C=O, which removes two H's and adds one O). So formula would be C6H8O.

But the options don't have that. So this doesn't fit any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I have to think differently. Let's think about all the data again.

The IR has a broad O-H (so either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid), a carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (maybe a conjugated system).

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

Mass spec has a peak at 45, which could be a fragment of CH2CH2OH (45).

So, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanol with a double bond. So the formula would be C6H10O. But wait, cyclohexanol is C6H12O, but that's option D, which has only one DoU.

Wait, but if it's a cyclohexene with an alcohol group, let's calculate the formula.

Cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding an OH (C6H10O) would subtract a hydrogen. So the formula would be C6H10O. That's option B.

But then, where is the carbonyl group? Because the IR has a peak at 1700, which implies a carbonyl.

So if the structure is a cyclohexene with an alcohol group and a ketone, that would require two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C).

But wait, cyclohexanone with a double bond and an OH group would have the formula C6H10O2.

So let's compute the formula. Cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a ketone (which is a C=O) would replace a CH2 group with a CO, so the formula becomes C6H8O.

Wait, no. Let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a ketone (O) and replacing a CH2 with a CO would take away two H's and add an O. So from C6H10O to C6H8O2? Not exactly, because adding another O would require another functional group.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2. Let's think of a molecule with a carbonyl and an O-H group, plus a double bond.

So, for example, a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group and a ketone substituent. So the structure would be something like 3-hydroxy-1-cyclohexen-2-one.

But the formula for that would be C6H8O2, which doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted diethyl acetal. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted ester with a double bond and an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with an OH group. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, which is CH2CH2OH, then the molecule must have a CH2CH2OH group attached. So the structure might be something like CH2CH2OH-CO-R.

But then, let's calculate the molecular formula. For example, if R is an ethyl group, then the formula would be C5H10O2. But our options have C6H10O2, which is one more carbon. So perhaps R is a methyl group. Then the formula would be C4H10O2. Still not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. Let me think about possible cleavage points.

If the molecule is an ester, perhaps it breaks into the R-O-CO-R' structure, where the R or R' part breaks off. For example, if the R is CH2CH2OH, then the fragment would be CH2CH2OH (45) plus the rest.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the IR data again. The 1700 peak is a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C in an aromatic ring or in a conjugated system like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Assuming it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the structure would have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl. So the IR would show the conjugated C=C around 1650.

In that case, the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but then where is the O-H? Unless the R group has an OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto acid, which has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. So the formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think of the options.

Only options B and C remain possible. The fragment at 45 suggests a CH2CH2OH group, which is 45.

If the formula is C6H10O (option B), then perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2OH-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal. Let's see: a five-membered ring with an O-H and a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be an allylic alcohol with a ketone.

For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COHCH2. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene with a ketone and an alcohol.

But without more info, I'm not making progress.

Another approach: The m/z 45 fragment is CH2CH2OH. So the molecular formula must have that fragment.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible structure could be CH2CH2OH-CO-O-R. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl maleate. Maleate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated diacid. But that would have two COOH groups, which would give a broad O-H peak.

But the formula for diethyl maleate would be C8H10O4, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester like a lactone. For example, a six-membered lactone (gamma-lactone) has the structure O=C-O-C5H9. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

In that case, the IR would show a carbonyl (lactone ester group) and possibly an O-H if it's a cyclic ester with a hydroxyl group. Wait, no, cyclic esters don't have O-H groups. So that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, unless it's a lactone with a hydroxyl group elsewhere. But that would require more oxygens.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to summarize.

The unknown compound has:

- O-H (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1)
- Carbonyl group (peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1)
- Double bond (vinyl H in NMR)
- Fragment at m/z 45.

The options are C6H12O2 (A), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O (D).

Eliminated options: A and D because they can't account for two DoU.

So between B and C.

Option B (C6H10O):

- Two DoU: could be a ring and a double bond.
- So, a cyclohexene with an OH group.
- But then, where's the carbonyl? Because the IR shows 1700.
- So for option B to be correct, the carbonyl would have to be part of the structure, which would require another O, making it option C.

Thus, option B can't be correct because it lacks the O for the carbonyl group.

So the correct option must be C: C6H10O2.

So the structure must have both O-H and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

Possible structures: a dihydroxy ketone, an ester with an O-H, or a beta-keto ester with an O-H.

But since option C has two O's, it could fit.

For example, the structure could be a cyclic hemiacetal with a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl succinate derivative with an OH group, but that's unclear.

But given the data, the molecular formula must be C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - Strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to a typical carbonyl stretch, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could represent a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C bond.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (C=C) confirm the presence of a double bond in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a common fragment such as CH2CH2OH (45 g/mol).

4. **Options and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
     \]
     - **Option A (C6H12O2)**: DoU = 1. This cannot account for the two DoU required (one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond or ring).
     - **Option B (C6H10O)**: DoU = 2. This could account for a double bond and a carbonyl, but it lacks an additional oxygen required for the O-H group observed in the IR spectrum.
     - **Option C (C6H10O2)**: DoU = 2. This fits the data, as it can accommodate a double bond, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group.
     - **Option D (C6H12O)**: DoU = 1. Similar to Option A, it cannot account for the two DoU required.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have both a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (vinyl hydrogens in NMR), along with an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹). The molecular formula **C6H10O2** (Option C) satisfies all the spectroscopic data, including the fragment peak at m/z = 45, which likely corresponds to CH2CH2OH. The other options fail to account for the observed functional groups or degrees of unsaturation.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data.

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak around 2500-3300, but sometimes the O-H in a carbonyl compound can be broad too. But if it's a very broad peak at 3000, could it be an alcohol?

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical carbonyl. Maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Or maybe an amide? But wait, the 1650 could also be conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if there are two different carbonyl groups, like maybe a ketone and an ester, but that might complicate things. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to a double bond. Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Hmm, not entirely sure yet, but let's note that there's a strong peak at 1700 and another at 1650.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, like maybe an alkene. So the molecule has a C=C somewhere.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. So I need to think about what fragments would produce a peak at 45. Common fragments at 45 could be CH3CO+ (which is 43, but maybe with something else?), or perhaps (CH3)2O is 45 (because 2*(15 for CH3) is 30, plus 16 for O is 46? Wait, no. Wait, molecular weight of (CH3)2O is 30 (2*CH3= 2*15 =30?) Wait, no. Let me calculate: CH3 is 15, so (CH3)2O is 15*2 + 16 = 46. Hmm, so 46. But wait, the fragment is m/z 45. So maybe something else. What else is 45? Maybe a CH2O group? Let's see: CH2O is 30 (12 + 2 + 16 =30). No, that's not 45. Wait, another option: an acetate group? The acetate ion is C2H3O2^- which has a molecular weight of 60 (12*2+3+16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59. Hmm, but that's 59, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Wait, maybe it's the acetyl group, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment of a ketone. For example, if the molecule breaks into a CH3CO group, that's 43 (12+16+1+12+16= no, wait: CH3CO is (12*2 + 1*4 + 16) = 24+4+16=44. Hmm, 44. Not 45. Or perhaps a CH2O group plus something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propyl group? Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of a CH3COCH3? No, that's (12*3 + 1*6 +16*2) =36+6+32=74. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps 45 comes from (CH3)CO? Let me compute that. CH3CO would be 12 + 16 + (12 + 3) = 12 +16=28, plus 15 (CH3) is 43. No, same as before. Hmmm.

Wait, another approach: a common fragment is the acetyl (CH3CO) group with a + charge, which would be m/z 43. But the question says 45. So perhaps it's a different fragment. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group. Wait, perhaps it's a fragment where a CH2 group is attached to something. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone group loses something.

Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, but wait, that's 46 as I thought earlier. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the molecular weight of something else. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to something else? Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ester group. For example, ethyl acetate's structure is CH3COOCH2CH3. If part of it breaks off, maybe the acetate group (which is C2H3O2^-). But that's 60, as I thought before.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's look at the options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So each has varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. So perhaps I can figure out the functional groups based on the IR and NMR, and then see which formula fits.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was O-H, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Then the peaks at 1700 and 1650: 1700 is probably a carbonyl. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, or perhaps an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene with substituents).

Wait, but benzene's C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe an aromatic ring with substituents causing some stretching, or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone next to a double bond.

So if the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which confirms a double bond. So the molecule has a C=C.

Putting it together, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, or maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So would that account for one of the degrees of unsaturation. Then another could be a ring or a carbonyl. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so that would be the other. So for option A, 1 degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. Wait, but the molecule has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group. So that's two degrees. But option A has only one degree. So that can't be right. Therefore, option A can't be the answer because it can't account for two degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

Option A: C6H12O2.

So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1.

But in the molecule, we have at least one double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group. That's two DoU, so this formula can't be correct. So option A is out.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees of unsaturation. That's possible. For example, a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a double bond and a carbonyl group. But in the IR, we have a carbonyl, so that's one DoU, and the vinyl H implies another, so that would account for two. That's possible. So option B is a possibility.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Again, two degrees. So same as option B, but with an additional O. So maybe a compound with a carbonyl and a double bond, plus perhaps another oxygen-containing group.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1.

Again, only one DoU. But the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl, which is two DoU, so this can't be. So D is out.

So the possible options are B and C.

Now, back to the IR and NMR.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an O-H group. So we're looking for a compound with an O-H, which would be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

The 1700 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group. So if we have O-H and a carbonyl, that's two functional groups. So perhaps the compound has both.

So possible structures could be a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would be a secondary alcohol, which might have a broad peak but perhaps less so than a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester (but esters don't have O-H). Wait, wait, no—esters are O-H? No, esters have an O-C-O structure but don't have an acidic O-H. So if we have O-H and a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the FTIR would have a very broad peak, perhaps around 2500-3300, but the question says 3000. Alternatively, an alcohol with a carbonyl.

Wait, another route: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The 1700 is a carbonyl, so that's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide (but I don't think that's the case here). But wait, the 1650 is also a peak. So perhaps the 1700 is the carbonyl and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

So for the structure, maybe a compound with both an O-H and a carbonyl group. For example, a phenolic compound with a carbonyl, or an alcohol with a ketone. But that would require the compound to have both groups.

Wait, but the formula options are C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc. Let's think about what functional groups are possible.

If the compound is an ester, it would have an O-CO-O group, but no O-H. So that wouldn't explain the broad peak at 3000. So perhaps it's a compound with an alcohol group and a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanone with an alcohol group, but that might not have a double bond.

Wait, wait. The problem says the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond, either as part of an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1650, which is lower than typical for a C=C in an alkene. So maybe it's an aromatic ring. The C=C in benzene is around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is at the higher end. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene, where the substituents cause the C=C to be at a higher wavenumber. Or perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, where the conjugation lowers the wavenumber a bit.

So, if the compound has a benzene ring, then that would account for the 1650 cm^-1 peak as the C=C stretching. But a benzene ring has three double bonds (each C-C is a double bond), so that would account for three degrees of unsaturation. But earlier, with options B and C, the DoU is only two. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So in that case, the ring (one DoU) and the double bond (another DoU), but that would be two DoU. But a cyclohexene would have a double bond and a ring, giving two DoU, which matches options B and C.

So, if the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H group, that would fit the data.

But wait, that would require the molecule to have three functional groups? Or perhaps a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent.

But then, the formula would need to account for that.

Let me think about the possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 2. So, either two rings, two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, plus the O's.

But if the structure has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group (C=O), that's two DoU, which would fit. So the molecule could be a cyclohexene with a ketone group and an alcohol group.

Wait, but that would require three substituents on the ring, which might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ketone, but that might not have the conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach: What if the compound is a diethyl acetal or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. But then, the O-H is still needed.

Wait, another thought: The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. Then, the 1700 cm^-1 peak would correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 peak would then be something else. But if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), that would have a carbonyl and an ester group, but no O-H. So that doesn't fit the O-H peak.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto acid. So, a structure like CH2(CO2H)COCH2CH2CH3 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think of possible structures that have a fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

If the formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32= 114. So the molecular ion would be around 114. Then, possible fragments: perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller piece.

If the fragment is 45, what could that be within the formula? Let's see: 45 is 45 grams per mole. So, what's the molecular formula that sums up to 45.

Possible options: C3H6O2? Let's compute: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 74 → too high. Hmm.

Wait, another way: 45 is 45. Let me think of functional groups that would have a mass of 45. Maybe a propyl group? No, that's 3 carbons, which would be 39 (12*3=36 + 3*1=3 → 39). Not 45. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to something. Maybe CH2O is 30, but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: The fragment at 45 is likely a common ion. For example, the acetylium ion (CH3CO+) has a molecular weight of 43. So 43 would be close, but the peak is at 45. So perhaps it's a fragment that includes two oxygen atoms? But O is 16, so 45 -16=29. Hmm, 29 could be C2H5 (29). So maybe CH3COOCH2-? Wait, that's more than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to an oxygen? Like CH2CH2O? Wait, (CH2CH2O) would be 12*2 +1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COCH3 (acetone) which is 58. No, that's too big.

Wait, maybe it's a hydroxyl group attached to something. For example, CH2CH2OH would be 12*2 +1*4 +17= 24+4+17=45. Oh! Wait, that's 45. So the fragment could be CH2CH2OH, which is ethylene glycol monoethyl ether or something. Wait, no, ethylene glycol is HOCH2CH2OH. But if the fragment is just HOCH2CH2, that would be 45.

Wait, but how would that fragment form? Maybe in the case of a compound with a neighboring CH2OH group breaking off.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen and a hydroxyl group. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO-O- group, but that would be 43 plus O (16) so 59, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again about the molecular formula. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible structures include esters, ketones, and alcohols. One possibility is something like methyl cyclohexene ketone, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible functional groups. An ester would have a carbonyl and an OR group. But then, where would the O-H come from? Maybe not an ester.

Wait, another thought: The broad O-H could be from a phenol group. So a phenol with a carbonyl group. But then, that would require a benzene ring, which would account for three DoU (the ring has three double bonds), but earlier the options only provide two DoU. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the O-H is from an alcohol, and the carbonyl is from a ketone. So the compound is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent.

So, for example, cyclohexene with a hydroxymethyl group and a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would look.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanone with a double bond and an OH group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentanone with a substituent. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetone derivative with an alcohol group and a double bond. For example, 3-penten-2-one with an alcohol substituent. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic compound, but that would require more DoU than allowed.

Wait, going back to the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there's a double bond, perhaps in an allylic position or as part of a ring.

Another thought: The FTIR has a 1700 cm^-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester. So if it's an ester, then the molecular formula would have two O's, like in option C (C6H10O2).

But wait, an ester's structure is R-O-CO-R. So that would have two O's in the ester group. Then, if the compound is an ester and has an O-H group, that would fit the IR data. So, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group. But that would imply a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another possibility: The compound is a beta-keto ester. So, for example, ethyl acetoacetate. Let me think about its structure. It has the structure CH3COCH2COOEt. Wait, that's four carbons in the main chain, but the options have six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester or a substituted ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl succinate or something, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Then the IR would have the carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated C=C at around 1650. That fits the IR data. So, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the carbonyl and the conjugated double bond. The O-H would come from where? If it's an ester, there's no O-H. Unless it's a hemiacetal or an acid, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group elsewhere. So, for example, a compound with an ester and an alcohol group.

But then the molecular formula would have to include both. Let's see, option C is C6H10O2. So, for an ester (which has two O's), plus an alcohol group (which adds another O). But that would require three O's, which would make the formula C6H10O3, which isn't an option. So that can't be. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of the ester group. But esters are OR-CO-O-R', so no, they don't have O-H.

Hmm. Maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal. Hemiacetals have an O-H group. But then, the carbonyl would be in the cyclic structure. So the IR would show the O-H and the carbonyl. That could fit.

For example, a cyclic hemiacetal like in glucose derivatives, but that's a six-membered ring. Wait, but the molecular formula may not fit. Let's think: cyclic hemiacetal would have a ring (so one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), but then another double bond? Or perhaps the hemiacetal has a double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ether linkage and an O-H group. But that seems complicated.

Another angle: Looking at the options again. The only options with O2 are A and C. So, the mass spec fragment is 45, which could be a CH2CH2OH group (45). If the compound has such a fragment, perhaps it's an ester where the R group is CH2CH2OH.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H10O2, then the ester would be something like R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R is CH2CH2OH and R' is another group.

Wait, let's compute the molecular formula. If R is CH2CH2OH (which is C2H5O), then R-O-CO-R' would need to sum up to C6H10O2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think of possible structures for each option and see which fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

Possible structures: esters, ketones with hydroxyl, etc.

If it's an ester, then it would be R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R is methyl (CH3O-) and R' is a pentyl group. But that would be CH3O-CO-R', but the molecular formula might not add up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopropane, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2. So two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond. So one DoU from that. The other must be a ring or another double bond.

But the IR has a carbonyl, which is another DoU. So that would make three DoU, but the formula only allows two. So that can't be.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the formula has two DoU, but the structure needs two (double bond and carbonyl), that's fine. Because each double bond or ring is one DoU. So a double bond (one) and a carbonyl (another) would make two DoU, which fits the formula.

So for option C, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the ester group (COO) contributes two oxygens, and the double bond contributes one DoU. That uses up both DoU.

But then where does the O-H come from? Because the FTIR shows an O-H. So the structure must have an O-H group as well.

Hmm, so an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the formula RCOOR', but that doesn't have an O-H. So perhaps the compound isn't an ester then.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester, which has both a ketone and an ester group. Let's see: structure would be RC(O)COOR'. That would have two carbonyl groups, but the IR only shows two peaks in the carbonyl region—1700 and 1650. So perhaps that's the case.

In that scenario, the two carbonyl peaks would correspond to the ketone (around 1700) and the ester (around 1650? But usually esters are around 1700-1750). Hmm, but 1650 is lower than typical ester carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe the ester is conjugated, which would lower the wavenumber.

But regardless, the presence of an O-H group is a problem because beta-keto esters don't have O-H groups. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxy ketone or something, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester with a hydroxyl group? Not sure.

Another thought: The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be from an alcohol O-H. So the compound has an alcohol group. The 1700 cm^-1 is from a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone. The 1650 cm^-1 is from a conjugated double bond.

So the structure could be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol substituent. That would use up two DoU (the ring and the double bond, but wait, the ring is a DoU, the double bond is another, but the ketone is another DoU, making three. But the formula allows for only two. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the ring is not a cyclohexene but a cyclopentene, which has a double bond and a ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexane with a double bond and a ketone group. But that again would require three DoU.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to approach it differently.

Looking at the options, only options B and C have two DoU. Option B is C6H10O. So two DoU, which could be a double bond and a ring. Or another combination.

The IR suggests a carbonyl (so another DoU), but in that case, how to fit?

Wait, perhaps in option B, the compound is a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. The cyclohexene has a ring (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), but that would require three DoU, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the DoU.

Wait, let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU. So the molecule must have one ring or one double bond. But the data suggests two DoU (double bond and carbonyl), which can't fit. So A is out.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU= (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoU. So possible structures: two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, or a ring and a carbonyl.

But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's one DoU, and the vinyl H suggests another, so that's two. So that fits. So the structure would have a carbonyl and a double bond.

But if the structure has a carbonyl and a double bond, then the O-H must come from somewhere else. So perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alkene and an alcohol group. But that would require three DoU, which option B can't have.

Wait, so perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group and a ring, but that would require the double bond to be part of the ring, making it a cyclic ketone.

For example, cyclohexanone. That's a six-membered ring (one DoU) with a ketone (another DoU). So that's two DoU, fitting option B (C6H10O).

But then, where is the O-H coming from? Because the IR shows a broad O-H peak. So perhaps the compound is a cyclohexanol derivative with a ketone. But that would require a secondary alcohol. So maybe a cyclohexanol with a ketone substituent.

But in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2, not C6H10O.

Hmm, so that's a problem. Because option B is C6H10O, which only has one O. So if the structure has both a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two O's, making the formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

So perhaps that's the case. Let me think: the structure is cyclohexanol with a ketone group. So it's a secondary alcohol and a ketone on the same ring. But the formula for that would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So that makes sense.

Now, the IR: the broad peak at 3000 is the O-H of the alcohol. The 1700 is the carbonyl (ketone). The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps another double bond elsewhere, but in this case, the structure is a cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ring with a ketone. So unless there's another double bond, the 1650 peak is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have the conjugated double bond. So the IR would show the carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group in the alpha,beta position.

Wait, but that would require the structure to be something like 1,2-cyclohexanedione? No, that's two ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-cyclohexen-1-one. So a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone. That would have a conjugated system, giving the C=C peak at around 1650.

In that structure, the formula would be C6H8O. Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the molecular formula.

Cyclohexene has the formula C6H10. Adding a ketone (which replaces a CH2 with a CO) would change the formula. If you have a cyclohexene ring with a ketone, that would be C6H8O. Because the cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding a ketone (which replaces a CH2 with a CO, thus subtracting two H's and adding an O.

Wait, so C6H10 → C6H8O (since CH2 becomes C=O, which removes two H's and adds one O). So formula would be C6H8O.

But the options don't have that. So this doesn't fit any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I have to think differently. Let's think about all the data again.

The IR has a broad O-H (so either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid), a carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (maybe a conjugated system).

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

Mass spec has a peak at 45, which could be a fragment of CH2CH2OH (45).

So, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanol with a double bond. So the formula would be C6H10O. But wait, cyclohexanol is C6H12O, but that's option D, which has only one DoU.

Wait, but if it's a cyclohexene with an alcohol group, let's calculate the formula.

Cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding an OH (C6H10O) would subtract a hydrogen. So the formula would be C6H10O. That's option B.

But then, where is the carbonyl group? Because the IR has a peak at 1700, which implies a carbonyl.

So if the structure is a cyclohexene with an alcohol group and a ketone, that would require two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C).

But wait, cyclohexanone with a double bond and an OH group would have the formula C6H10O2.

So let's compute the formula. Cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a ketone (which is a C=O) would replace a CH2 group with a CO, so the formula becomes C6H8O.

Wait, no. Let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a ketone (O) and replacing a CH2 with a CO would take away two H's and add an O. So from C6H10O to C6H8O2? Not exactly, because adding another O would require another functional group.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2. Let's think of a molecule with a carbonyl and an O-H group, plus a double bond.

So, for example, a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group and a ketone substituent. So the structure would be something like 3-hydroxy-1-cyclohexen-2-one.

But the formula for that would be C6H8O2, which doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted diethyl acetal. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted ester with a double bond and an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with an OH group. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, which is CH2CH2OH, then the molecule must have a CH2CH2OH group attached. So the structure might be something like CH2CH2OH-CO-R.

But then, let's calculate the molecular formula. For example, if R is an ethyl group, then the formula would be C5H10O2. But our options have C6H10O2, which is one more carbon. So perhaps R is a methyl group. Then the formula would be C4H10O2. Still not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. Let me think about possible cleavage points.

If the molecule is an ester, perhaps it breaks into the R-O-CO-R' structure, where the R or R' part breaks off. For example, if the R is CH2CH2OH, then the fragment would be CH2CH2OH (45) plus the rest.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the IR data again. The 1700 peak is a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C in an aromatic ring or in a conjugated system like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Assuming it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the structure would have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl. So the IR would show the conjugated C=C around 1650.

In that case, the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but then where is the O-H? Unless the R group has an OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto acid, which has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. So the formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think of the options.

Only options B and C remain possible. The fragment at 45 suggests a CH2CH2OH group, which is 45.

If the formula is C6H10O (option B), then perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2OH-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal. Let's see: a five-membered ring with an O-H and a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be an allylic alcohol with a ketone.

For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COHCH2. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene with a ketone and an alcohol.

But without more info, I'm not making progress.

Another approach: The m/z 45 fragment is CH2CH2OH. So the molecular formula must have that fragment.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible structure could be CH2CH2OH-CO-O-R. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl maleate. Maleate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated diacid. But that would have two COOH groups, which would give a broad O-H peak.

But the formula for diethyl maleate would be C8H10O4, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester like a lactone. For example, a six-membered lactone (gamma-lactone) has the structure O=C-O-C5H9. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

In that case, the IR would show a carbonyl (lactone ester group) and possibly an O-H if it's a cyclic ester with a hydroxyl group. Wait, no, cyclic esters don't have O-H groups. So that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, unless it's a lactone with a hydroxyl group elsewhere. But that would require more oxygens.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to summarize.

The unknown compound has:

- O-H (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1)
- Carbonyl group (peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1)
- Double bond (vinyl H in NMR)
- Fragment at m/z 45.

The options are C6H12O2 (A), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O (D).

Eliminated options: A and D because they can't account for two DoU.

So between B and C.

Option B (C6H10O):

- Two DoU: could be a ring and a double bond.
- So, a cyclohexene with an OH group.
- But then, where's the carbonyl? Because the IR shows 1700.
- So for option B to be correct, the carbonyl would have to be part of the structure, which would require another O, making it option C.

Thus, option B can't be correct because it lacks the O for the carbonyl group.

So the correct option must be C: C6H10O2.

So the structure must have both O-H and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

Possible structures: a dihydroxy ketone, an ester with an O-H, or a beta-keto ester with an O-H.

But since option C has two O's, it could fit.

For example, the structure could be a cyclic hemiacetal with a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl succinate derivative with an OH group, but that's unclear.

But given the data, the molecular formula must be C6H10O2.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - Strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to a typical carbonyl stretch, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could represent a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C bond.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (C=C) confirm the presence of a double bond in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a common fragment such as CH2CH2OH (45 g/mol).

4. **Options and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
     \]
     - **Option A (C6H12O2)**: DoU = 1. This cannot account for the two DoU required (one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond or ring).
     - **Option B (C6H10O)**: DoU = 2. This could account for a double bond and a carbonyl, but it lacks an additional oxygen required for the O-H group observed in the IR spectrum.
     - **Option C (C6H10O2)**: DoU = 2. This fits the data, as it can accommodate a double bond, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group.
     - **Option D (C6H12O)**: DoU = 1. Similar to Option A, it cannot account for the two DoU required.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have both a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (vinyl hydrogens in NMR), along with an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹). The molecular formula **C6H10O2** (Option C) satisfies all the spectroscopic data, including the fragment peak at m/z = 45, which likely corresponds to CH2CH2OH. The other options fail to account for the observed functional groups or degrees of unsaturation.

**Answer: C**
