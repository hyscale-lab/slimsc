Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what's happening when these acids and base are mixed. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The most common example is when an acid like HCl reacts with a base like NaOH to produce NaCl and water. But in this case, there are three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I have to figure out how they react together.

Wait, let's write down the given data. The solutions are:
- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

I think I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization reactions depend on the moles available to react.

HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base but each mole provides two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Starting with HCl:
Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so that's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base Ba(OH)2:
Moles = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Ah, so the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. The question is, which one is in excess?

H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.08 moles remaining (0.28 -0.2 = 0.08).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because H2SO4 is diprotic. Does the second H+ get completely ionized? I think in strong acid, yes. So both H+ ions are available.

So the neutralization reaction would proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Since OH- is less, it'll all get used up, and some H+ remains.

Wait, but when you mix these solutions, the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L. But I don't think the volume affects the moles, only the concentrations before mixing.

So the moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and there will be excess H+ of 0.08 moles.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard neutralization enthalpy is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or about -2.72 kcal/mol, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Because 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.69 kcal, but wait, no: 57300 J / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,300 J is 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal/mol.

Wait, but some textbooks say about -57.3 kJ/mol, which would be about -13.65 kcal/mol. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 1/5 of that. So perhaps that's per mole of H+ reacting.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy for neutralization is given per mole of H+ reacting. So if 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH-, it releases about 57.3 kJ (or about 13.65 kcal), but that can't be right because 57.3 kJ is about 13.65 kcal. Wait, 57,300 J is 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal.

But wait, in the options, I see option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's about 16,000 J, which is 16 kJ. But the standard is 57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), because that's the value for the reaction:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O(l), ΔH ≈ -57.3 kJ/mol

So each mole of H+ that reacts releases 57.3 kJ.

In our problem, the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Hmm, perhaps let me see the units.

Wait, the options mix kcal and kJ. Let me check the units of the options.

Option A: -2.72 kcal → about 11.5 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ, so 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.38 kJ).

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.69 kcal, so 0.2 mol would be about 2.738 kcal. Wait, no. Wait, 57.3 kJ is 13.69 kcal; 0.2 mol × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. Converting that to kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close, but let's see.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck. So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases 57.3 kJ. So 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, that's in kcal. Because 11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So the enthalpy is about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reactant, as earlier. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Wait, but none of the options directly say -11.46 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, but wait: 57.3 kJ per mole is about 13.69 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 ×13.69 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So that's about -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry of the reactions properly, considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Does the second H+ also contribute?

Wait, for Ba(OH)2, each mole gives 2 OH-. So the reaction with H+ would be:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So for each H+ and each OH-, one mole of water, releasing 57.3 kJ.

In the case of H2SO4, the first H+ is strong, but the second is also strong, as H2SO4 is a strong acid. So in solution, both H+ ions are present.

So the initial calculation is correct: 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Wait, but another point to think about: the neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. How does that reaction proceed?

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4 and water. The balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-.

So the mole ratio between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

But wait, in our case, the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So if they react in a 1:1 ratio, the H2SO4 would be the limiting reagent, with 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 would have 0.01 moles left.

Wait, but then there's also HCl present. So it's a bit more complicated because all three solutions are mixed together.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider all possible reactions. Let's break it down.

First, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 will react with H2SO4 first, since they have a 1:1 ratio, and the reaction produces BaSO4 precipitate and water.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting, as 0.09 is less than 0.1.

So they'll react completely, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

In this reaction, all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 are consumed, and 0.18 moles of H+ (since H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole) are neutralized. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole. So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are neutralized by 2 OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles. So in this reaction, 0.18 moles of OH- are consumed (neutralizing 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4), leaving 0.2 -0.18 = 0.02 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are available, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O

So the mole ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

This reaction would consume 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If any is left after the reaction, it would dissociate completely. So the remaining 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2 would contribute 0.02 moles of OH-.

Additionally, the HCl would dissociate completely, providing 0.1 moles of H+.

So after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, what's left?

H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 moles.

So then, these H+ and OH- will react:

H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57.3 kJ per mole.

So the available H+ is 0.1, OH- is 0.02. So OH- is the limiting reactant again. So all 0.02 moles of OH- will react with 0.02 moles of H+.

So total H+ consumed is 0.02.

So overall, let me sum up all the H+ neutralized:

From the H2SO4 reaction: 0.18 moles H+ neutralized.

From HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 moles H+ neutralized.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.20 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 moles × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, so that's approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is in kcal, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me convert -11.46 kJ to kcal to see which option it aligns with.

1 kJ = 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So 11.46 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But wait, earlier calculation when I thought all 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- were reacting gave a similar result. So regardless of the order, the H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, leading to 11.46 kJ or ~2.74 kcal.

Wait, but in this alternative approach, I first considered the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, leading to 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting, consuming 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH-, and then the remaining 0.02 OH- reacts with HCl's H+.

In this case, total H+ neutralized is 0.20 moles, same as before.

So regardless of the approach, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, leading to 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ or -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. That's about -11,420 kJ? No, wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48,  11.42 kcal is 48.4 kJ (11.42 *4.184 ≈47.7 kJ). Wait, wait, that's not the same as 11.46 kJ. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the neutralization.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each H+ contributes to the neutralization, but we have to account for all the H+.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and moles of OH- before considering any reactions.

Total H+ = from HCl (0.1) + from H2SO4 (0.18) = 0.28.

Total OH- = from Ba(OH)2 (0.2).

So neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.28 -0.2 = 0.08 moles H+ left.

So moles of H2O formed: 0.2 moles.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

So how does this fit into the options?

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of solution or something else. Wait, no, the standard is per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is considering that H2SO4 contributes two equivalents of H+ and Ba(OH)2 contributes two equivalents of OH-, so the net is:

H+ total: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- total: 0.2 from Ba(OH)2.

So 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.46 kJ or -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close, and option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16 kJ, way off.

So why is option B -11.42 kcal?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

57.3 kJ/mol is exactly 57300 J/mol. So 0.2 mol ×57300 J/mol = 11460 J, which is 11.46 kJ. Converting to kcal: 11460 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.738 kcal.

So approximately -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal. But perhaps I should check the exact math.

Wait, 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46.

But let's calculate 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a larger magnitude, so that's not right. So probably option B is in kcal but for a different number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each provides 2 H+ →0.18 moles.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction: 0.28 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.738 kcal.

Looking back, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 11,420 kJ, which is way off. No, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's 11.42 kcal, which is approximately 48.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ). But according to our calculation, it's about 11.46 kJ, so option B can't be correct.

So the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Did I mess up the units somewhere? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 16,000 J. Our calculation is -11.46 kJ, which is close to option A.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of H₂SO₄} \). Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since there are \( 0.28 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, and all \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) reacting with one mole of \( \text{OH⁻} \) is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.69 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) reacting, the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting to kcal: \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect because it does not match the calculated value in kcal.
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect because it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what's happening when these acids and base are mixed. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The most common example is when an acid like HCl reacts with a base like NaOH to produce NaCl and water. But in this case, there are three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I have to figure out how they react together.

Wait, let's write down the given data. The solutions are:
- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

I think I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization reactions depend on the moles available to react.

HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base but each mole provides two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Starting with HCl:
Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so that's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base Ba(OH)2:
Moles = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Ah, so the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. The question is, which one is in excess?

H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.08 moles remaining (0.28 -0.2 = 0.08).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because H2SO4 is diprotic. Does the second H+ get completely ionized? I think in strong acid, yes. So both H+ ions are available.

So the neutralization reaction would proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Since OH- is less, it'll all get used up, and some H+ remains.

Wait, but when you mix these solutions, the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L. But I don't think the volume affects the moles, only the concentrations before mixing.

So the moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and there will be excess H+ of 0.08 moles.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard neutralization enthalpy is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or about -2.72 kcal/mol, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Because 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.69 kcal, but wait, no: 57300 J / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,300 J is 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal/mol.

Wait, but some textbooks say about -57.3 kJ/mol, which would be about -13.65 kcal/mol. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 1/5 of that. So perhaps that's per mole of H+ reacting.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy for neutralization is given per mole of H+ reacting. So if 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH-, it releases about 57.3 kJ (or about 13.65 kcal), but that can't be right because 57.3 kJ is about 13.65 kcal. Wait, 57,300 J is 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.69 kcal.

But wait, in the options, I see option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's about 16,000 J, which is 16 kJ. But the standard is 57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), because that's the value for the reaction:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O(l), ΔH ≈ -57.3 kJ/mol

So each mole of H+ that reacts releases 57.3 kJ.

In our problem, the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Hmm, perhaps let me see the units.

Wait, the options mix kcal and kJ. Let me check the units of the options.

Option A: -2.72 kcal → about 11.5 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ, so 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.38 kJ).

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.69 kcal, so 0.2 mol would be about 2.738 kcal. Wait, no. Wait, 57.3 kJ is 13.69 kcal; 0.2 mol × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. Converting that to kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close, but let's see.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck. So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases 57.3 kJ. So 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, that's in kcal. Because 11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So the enthalpy is about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reactant, as earlier. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Wait, but none of the options directly say -11.46 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, but wait: 57.3 kJ per mole is about 13.69 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 ×13.69 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So that's about -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry of the reactions properly, considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Does the second H+ also contribute?

Wait, for Ba(OH)2, each mole gives 2 OH-. So the reaction with H+ would be:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So for each H+ and each OH-, one mole of water, releasing 57.3 kJ.

In the case of H2SO4, the first H+ is strong, but the second is also strong, as H2SO4 is a strong acid. So in solution, both H+ ions are present.

So the initial calculation is correct: 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Wait, but another point to think about: the neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. How does that reaction proceed?

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4 and water. The balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-.

So the mole ratio between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

But wait, in our case, the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So if they react in a 1:1 ratio, the H2SO4 would be the limiting reagent, with 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 would have 0.01 moles left.

Wait, but then there's also HCl present. So it's a bit more complicated because all three solutions are mixed together.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider all possible reactions. Let's break it down.

First, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 will react with H2SO4 first, since they have a 1:1 ratio, and the reaction produces BaSO4 precipitate and water.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting, as 0.09 is less than 0.1.

So they'll react completely, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

In this reaction, all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 are consumed, and 0.18 moles of H+ (since H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole) are neutralized. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole. So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are neutralized by 2 OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles. So in this reaction, 0.18 moles of OH- are consumed (neutralizing 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4), leaving 0.2 -0.18 = 0.02 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are available, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O

So the mole ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

This reaction would consume 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If any is left after the reaction, it would dissociate completely. So the remaining 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2 would contribute 0.02 moles of OH-.

Additionally, the HCl would dissociate completely, providing 0.1 moles of H+.

So after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, what's left?

H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 moles.

So then, these H+ and OH- will react:

H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57.3 kJ per mole.

So the available H+ is 0.1, OH- is 0.02. So OH- is the limiting reactant again. So all 0.02 moles of OH- will react with 0.02 moles of H+.

So total H+ consumed is 0.02.

So overall, let me sum up all the H+ neutralized:

From the H2SO4 reaction: 0.18 moles H+ neutralized.

From HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 moles H+ neutralized.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.20 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 moles × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, so that's approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is in kcal, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me convert -11.46 kJ to kcal to see which option it aligns with.

1 kJ = 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So 11.46 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But wait, earlier calculation when I thought all 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- were reacting gave a similar result. So regardless of the order, the H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, leading to 11.46 kJ or ~2.74 kcal.

Wait, but in this alternative approach, I first considered the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, leading to 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting, consuming 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH-, and then the remaining 0.02 OH- reacts with HCl's H+.

In this case, total H+ neutralized is 0.20 moles, same as before.

So regardless of the approach, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, leading to 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ or -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. That's about -11,420 kJ? No, wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48,  11.42 kcal is 48.4 kJ (11.42 *4.184 ≈47.7 kJ). Wait, wait, that's not the same as 11.46 kJ. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the neutralization.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each H+ contributes to the neutralization, but we have to account for all the H+.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and moles of OH- before considering any reactions.

Total H+ = from HCl (0.1) + from H2SO4 (0.18) = 0.28.

Total OH- = from Ba(OH)2 (0.2).

So neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.28 -0.2 = 0.08 moles H+ left.

So moles of H2O formed: 0.2 moles.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

So how does this fit into the options?

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of solution or something else. Wait, no, the standard is per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is considering that H2SO4 contributes two equivalents of H+ and Ba(OH)2 contributes two equivalents of OH-, so the net is:

H+ total: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- total: 0.2 from Ba(OH)2.

So 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.46 kJ or -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close, and option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16 kJ, way off.

So why is option B -11.42 kcal?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

57.3 kJ/mol is exactly 57300 J/mol. So 0.2 mol ×57300 J/mol = 11460 J, which is 11.46 kJ. Converting to kcal: 11460 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.738 kcal.

So approximately -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal. But perhaps I should check the exact math.

Wait, 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46.

But let's calculate 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a larger magnitude, so that's not right. So probably option B is in kcal but for a different number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each provides 2 H+ →0.18 moles.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction: 0.28 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.738 kcal.

Looking back, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 11,420 kJ, which is way off. No, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's 11.42 kcal, which is approximately 48.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ). But according to our calculation, it's about 11.46 kJ, so option B can't be correct.

So the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Did I mess up the units somewhere? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 16,000 J. Our calculation is -11.46 kJ, which is close to option A.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of H₂SO₄} \). Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since there are \( 0.28 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, and all \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) reacting with one mole of \( \text{OH⁻} \) is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.69 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) reacting, the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting to kcal: \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect because it does not match the calculated value in kcal.
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect because it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
